How horribly we treated Germans after WW2
This is a subject we aren't being taught about in school since we trying to let it slide past as something that happened but doesn't happen anymore (which is true though)
Edit: It's not like we don't get to know about it, but there aren't dedicated lessons about it in history class
I guess colonization is a dark time for many countries, in Denmark is was no different, but often you talk about the islands is the Caribbean or Africa, but the treatment of Greenlandic people has been absolutely horrible in Denmark
They have been treated 2
rank citizens, and everything was dictated from Denmark and they had little to no say in it
Still I have heard that higher education in Greenland is taught in Danish not Greenlandic, but they might have changed that
Denmark was probably the clear frontrunner when it came to lobotomies
Between 1951 and 1984 4
500 lobotomies were performed on developmentally challenged and "morally deficient" men, women **and** children all the way down to 6 year olds
The number 4
500 needs to be considered in the context that in total population of Denmark in '51 was 4,3 mio
and in '84 it was 5,1 mio
During those 33 years the state lobotomized roughly every 1000th citizen
Denmark passed a law in 1985 that was supposed to ban the use of corporal punishment, so parents could no longer legally beat their children, but it was worded so vaguely that it was in dispute if parents were only obliged to keep others from using corporal punishment against their children or if they had to keep their children safe from all violence, even their own
Sadly it had to take a whole 14 years before finally in 1997 it was clarified to clearly state that parents may not hurt their children
Even then there were several political parties that were against this change
our right wing populist party was created out of an openly racists party in the 1970's and since 2001 they have been in a coalition with the rest of the centre-right parties and forced extreme immigration laws and normalized racists rhetoric before most other european nations, our social-democratic party is now in power through a coalition, but not changing those laws because they fear backlash and only the far leftwing is directly trying to change the laws, but wont challenge the social-democrats leadership on this issue
an example; You arn't automatically a Danish citizen even if you are born here to none danish parents, and becomming a citizen is extermly hard for none EU citizens
There are people when spoken about in the media is called "2ed or 3rd generation immigrants" - hence they were born and raised here, only went to danish schools, but could get deported any time
And our system dosn't regard marriage or having children with an immigrant as reason for that person not to be deported
Our asylum seeking and refugee laws have been challanged by the EU court of human rights, since we can deport anyone so long as there isn't an active war in their local home region of their nation of origin
Denmark was the fourth biggest slave traders in the 1700’s and after WW2 we forced german POW to clean up our beaches from mines and most of them were 15-16 years
I once made the mistake of listening to the BBC radio doc [Ireland’s Forced Labour Survivors] on my way to work, and I was openly weeping when I arrived
The lack of culpability or even (seemingly) remorse from the people and institutions responsible is just so infuriating
same here in Denmark with the greenlandic inuits
I my history classes we were taught about this
Guess it is up to the teachers
Damn, Latvians striked me as some of the most anti-communist people around
What is the reason for this
I know that during the Russian empire, the defenders of Ukrainian cultural rights and such were in large part some of kind of left-wing/communist opposition, is it part of a legacy of that for Latvians as well
It really is
In my years of public school, most of the history lessons was spend on ww1 and 1864
Which was way too much
We saw the movie "under sandet" in history class however a surprising number of my classmates actually thought it was okay to force Germans to clear mines in Denmark
That was further back in the past and doesn't have the same impact
There were no need to have rage against Germans that weren't supporting the nazi regime
And there are still people alive today who remember that time
Not to my knowledge, I was quite surprised when I was quite surprised when I learned about it a few years ago
Could you expand on that argument, please
I read through the story you linked, and couldn't really find anything related to your statement
Alright, thanks a lot for the detailed answer
yeah, they died by accident when the leadership mismanaged a sickness outbreak and some food rations where diverted or lost, as I remember it
No need to be sorry
Our king was a dumbass to go to war anyway
Ah, I was wondering why you were thinking we would be forcefully sterilizing immigrants
I'll take the liberty to split you your comment to hopefully give some insight in the right context
>Basically, the argument that immigrants are forced to give up their children to learn Danish values, religious holidays, language, and tradition, that isn't required for children who don't live in low income neighborhoods
This is true, and is still an issue that is being debated hotly
The arguments for this is, that children of non-western immigrants often integrate poorly into Danish society, and integration is key to maintaining the welfare state
Withholding welfare payments makes sense, since those payments requires the receiver (the parent) to be available and ready to take a job - which is impossible with small kids at home
Some Danish parents also chose to keep their kids at home, and forego the payments
The arguments against, is personal freedom to keep your kids at home, and still be able to live decently even though you're (relatively) new in the country
>(according to the article, the Danish government is forcing a lot of immigrants to live in the ghetto)
Not true
It's true that refugees are "placed" in different municipalities
(This is done to share the economical burden of receiving refugees equally between all municipalities)
The receiving municipality has a duty to assign refugees a permanent home, but this home can not be in a ghetto (or in an "fragile/exposed housing zone")
If the refugees are able to find other housing at the same cost within the municipality, they're free to do so
([source in Danish]
>and can be argued as destroying the family's original culture and religion to make them into "proper Danes"
The intent of coercing the children into regular daycare (along with pretty much every other kid in Denmark) is absolutely not to deny a family their culture or religion, but to teach the kids about the society will be growing up in
We have freedom of - and from - religion (I'm not Christian), but Denmark is a Christian nation per design, so we'll just have to accept that a lot of things happen, that are based in Christianity, and that's why it's important to teach the kids about it
I feel it's important to note that we're not talking about special kindergartens, but something that 91% of kids between 1-2 years old attends (rising to 97% for 3-5 years olds) I suppose I could link a few articles about the daily life in kindergartens, but I might come off as cherry picking, so I'll let you search for such stories yourself
>And there's the politician who wanted electronic ankle bracelets on children who live in the ghettos, but not other children, which would disproportionally affect Danish children born to immigrants
Yeah, we have idiot politicians here too
One drawback with a democracy where gaining 2% of the vote will get your party a number of seats in parliament is that we usually have a lot of MPs with "alternative" opinions
So, is everything in your original story false
Not at all, but it's important to understand that the essence of living in Denmark is that you need to help the country if you want to country to help you
You're absolutely free to keep your kids at home and teach them whatever you chose, but don't expect society to pay you for it
As a comparison, society will help you if you're jobless, but it's a requirement that you're actively seeking employment
Finally, maybe using the word "Ghetto" as a nomination for certain areas are not entirely politically correct, but any notion of those areas referring to Poland in WW2 is utter nonsense
[Here's the official definition on how to designate "Ghetto areas"]
My (poor) translation/rewrite:
An area is a ghetto if the following is true
- an area has more than 1000 inhabitants
- The amount of immigrants and descendants of immigrants from non-western countries is above 50%
and if any two of the following statements are true
- The amount of inhabitants aged 18-64, who is not employed or signed up for an education, is above 40%. Counted as an average over the last two years
- The amount of inhabitants who have received judgements against them for violating the law regarding violence, weapons, or drugs, is at least three times larger than the national average
Counted as an average over the last two years
- The amount of inhabitants aged 30-59, who have only primary schooling, is at least 60% of all inhabitants in that age group
- The average income for people aged 15-64 in the area (not including people signed up for education) is less than 55% of the average income for the same group in that region
(A "region" is simply put a "super municipality" with ~1 mill
people)
Scandinavism is in no way dead, we're still united in hating Sweden
>problems arise when you compare immigration proaccesses in our tiny nation with nations founded on it or old European empires who had subjects from all over the world with our small nations with a very complex language, nearly ethnically homogeneous nation where there are deep rooted cultural norms which are completely different from others cultures
>One thing is that our right-wing populist and anti-immigrant party has been in coalition governments with the rest of the centre-right parties since 2001, so they have had a very large influence on how asylum seekers, refugees and immigrants are talked about in the media and are constantly pushing the racism laws on whats acceptable and with their and other right-wing anti-immigrant parties growth, the centre parties and social-democrats havn't fought back fearing backlash in the elections, against "harsher laws", making it possible to deport refugees to war zones, putting whole families where one is a criminal into "camps" etc,
It's a loving hate
I know for a fact, that Danes hate Swedes because of our centuries old rivalry
I'd guess Norwegians do too, because of them being under Denmark during the rivalry, or maybe something to do with Swedes working in Norway
And Finland hates everyone
Sweden,
Obviously
Sweden all the way
Then we could extend the bridge to Norway instead

Pretty sure we were the first country to legalize porn
If a swede tries to cross the border via a frozen over øresund (the water between Denmark and Sweden), it is allowed for us danes to beat them with a stick
Well, my country was the first to outlaw slavery
Yup, in 1969
Yea, but we also forgot to criminalize child porn
It only became illegal in 1980
Animal porn was also legal up until 2015

"Huh" would be my answer, I guess
I know there are other things going on, but I am genuinely shocked that a party calling themselves the Conservative Party and ostensibly representing the gentry would even consider letting such a buffoon even join - let alone elect him leader
Conventional wisdom say that people turn toward the right as they grow older, but I'm hoping events like this and the debacle happening across the ocean might be enough to turn that specific tide

What was a “bruh moment” in your country’s history
For Denmark, I’d say it was when Danish politicians and Norwegian politicians discussed the oil resources in the Nordic sea
Our foreign affair minister, Per Hækkerup, got drunk and then basically gave Norway all of it
> Our foreign affair minister, Per Hækkerup, got drunk and then basically gave Norway all of it
Which is a myth of course
But Denmark did miss out on the oil though:
"In 1965, the current prime minister of Denmark signed the final agreement to divide the North Sea between Norway and Denmark according to the median line, causing Denmark to miss out on the huge and valuable field Ekofisk
When the Germans invaded Denmark during WWII, blasted through my grandfathers village at his 6th birthday
>Our foreign affair minister, Per Hækkerup, got drunk and then basically gave Norway all of it
Allegedly
Iceland declaring independence while we were under german occupation
You know the whole Christianity thing bro
Now that's a large scale bruh moment
"Oil is just a fad"
Denmark missed out on the oil because it didn't have the right to it according to the common rules for dividing ocean resources
Also, Ekofisk is closer to being in the British sector than the Danish one
Then I would say 22 out of 179 politicians in the parliament voting against a ban on child pornography in 1980 :D
Seriøst
Hvilken landsby var det
Er faktisk lidt nysgerrig
Yeah, it's him
I'd slap you for your insolence but alas, I'm to drunk
> according to the common rules for dividing ocean resources
Yes, that is what I wrote
But there are other (sub)principles for dividing ocean resources than strictly following the median line
Had the Ekofish field been known at the time, I'm sure the Danish-Norwegian discussions had been somewhat more difficult

You get paid by the state, around 1900 usd a mounth, live in a small apartment, you're poor because you somehow can't or won't work, you have to send job applications more or less constantly to get paid
Those who can't work due to physical illness don't need to though
Edit: read replying comments for info I wasn't aware of
An annual salary of 15700€ or less after tax for an adult living alone
Typically lives in the suburbs of a bigger city or more centrally in a small town
Rarely in a city center or countryside
Debt is uncommon as they live in rented houses/apartments, unless they made loans which can get unbelieveably expensive here (700-800% APRC)
Probably drives an old VW, Peugeot or something similar
You forget that many of the people who can’t work are wrongfully assessed by the system and have to go years through a bureaucratic hell
Also you forget about the homeless who have to get by in one of the most expensive countries in the world
Really
I didn't know that at all
Thank you for adding this
It's called "kontanthjælp" which translates to "cash assistance". Our high taxes goes towards for example money for those who cannot work, like cash assistance, so they can have a decent life with their own home
Meaning a lot of homeless people have also made a choice themselves that they would rather be homeless than have cash assistance for example
Yeah we usually drive to Germany to buy chocolate and soda
Haha

Not at all, and I use English extensively, as in I study at a university in England were I spend the majority of the year
But I almost never "forget" what the Danish equivalent of a word when speaking or writing it is unless it is a technial term I've literally only been taught in English
Reading this thread, it seems I am in the minority
This is actually quite good to know, as whenever one of my acquaintances would return from study exchange programmes from the USA or UK, they would seemingly "forget" many Danish words as they spoke exchanging them for English ones, and this would annoy me quite a bit as I thought they were putting on a show to seem more worldly
It seems I should have been more accepting of the fact that they might have had genuine difficulties switching back to Danish when they returned
Yeah
I sometimes say english words with a danish pronounsiation and that is actually getting quite common with the youth in Denmark
Oh yes, all the time
Socializing in Danish is literally impossible for me, and I look like an idiot IRL
English is technically my first language
But while I’m Danish I do prefer speaking English as I feel like It’s a much more expressive language, and I feel much more confident and relaxed speaking English with foreigners as opposed to speaking Danish with other Danes (Don’t have the same interests/Denmark is the worst place on earth to make friends)
Yeah, it can be hard to express slightly complex sentences because I imagine them in English and forget the Danish word/it doesn't exist
i got used to thinking in english and i don’t talk much with people in my native language so i’ve gotten pretty bad at it
it sucks, i’m trying to think more in my native language but it’s kinda hard, if that makes sense
Men inderst inde ved vi jo alle godt, at Svensk er værd at glemme
but *le travel*?
Same with me and German, I'd always use English words in the German oral exams
Min fejl, kom bare ind
In Denmark, accents are very split
I'd say our English speakers can be put categorised into four groups:
1: People, mostly the older generation, who never learned much English, as children, and therefore speak it quite poorly, and of course, with a strong Danish accent
2: People who speak English very well, with excellent vocabulary, but retain their Danish accents on purpose
3: People who speak English very well, with a neutral (American-ish) accent, usually higher educated young people, in their 20s.
4: People who speak great English, and actively fake an accent that isn't Danish
It's mostly a British/English accent, but I've heard Scottish, Irish, Australian, and basically every other English speaking country
I can do both a British and an American accent
I don’t speak Danglish, which is nice
So yeah, I think so
Nah I hate hearing myself or other Danes speaking English
It does actually hold me back at times because I think sounds so bad
My english teacher, when I went to my efterskole, was british
He told me I had a posh accent
I mean, I dont mind it
Love the language, love the people
no I actually hate it, damned potato in mouth accent
Since I grew up on Hollywood films and english video games as much as anything Danish I understand it very well and use it daily, I have tried making it more smooth but its difficult, and I have actually found myself thinking in English as much as Danish when I try to write fiction, since many of the books I love the most I read in English and draws inspiration from those as much as anything I learned during school
I like mine but it doesn't sound very danish
i really dont like the danish accent
Speaking English as a Dane is game of avoiding speaking Danglish
There's always that one guy who doesn't try to avoid it and every other Dane feels secondhand embarrassment as it sounds horrible
yeah and the 4th category are usually so goddamn annoying
like 8 out of 10 times they are doing a terrible impression of it and come across as trying to sound stuck up or better than the rest with their generic/american accent and think they are doing a great job of it
(aha sorry, got a couple of classmates who are like this)
This is too true, especially the last one
I always sound like I'm trying to fake a Scottish accent when I speak English
I know it's really annoying when people try to fake accents and I wish I could just speak with a neutral accent :\
I think it's one of the nicest things to listen to
i feel lots of Danes have an american accent when speaking English
firstly we start learning it when we're like 6, and then all of our movies and shows are in english and not dubbed so lots of constant exposure to it
If you've ever heard Mads Mikkelsen speaking, that's sort of what we sound like
sounds about right
and in my comment i wasnt talking about people actually living in the country where they speak with that accent, i meant people who had been in England/Australia once on vacation, and now think they can pull the accent off flawlessly
oh hunny, you really dont
Personally - and for people I know - it is about price vs
quality and because of Apple's business model
If you use Android, you are free to choose whatever brand phone, tablet, computer you want and they will all have more or less the same OS
But with Apple products, it can only be Apple computer, tablet and phone, if they are to work properly together
If you want iOS, you have to buy Apple, but if you want Android OS, you can choose
I don't want to be tied to one perticular company
Something I have noticed is that iPhone owners always refer to their phone as "my iPhone". "Where is my iPhone, have you seen my iPhone, let me check my iPhone". Everybody else just say "my phone" not "my Samsung, my Huawei, my LG".
Probably many reasons
Now this is the perspective from someone in their final year of high school
(Everyone is  between the ages 18-20)
A large part of it comes down to social stigma, whereas in the US iMessage is big, and anyone without a green bubble is considered inferior, in Europe, we mainly use Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger
This means that the retarded blue vs green bubble debate is practically nonexistent
It therefore has little bearing on you socially which phone you use
Then there's the question of money
Many will likely point out that large parts of Europe, especially southern Europe, people will have android because it's cheaper
Probably has an impact of some degree sure, but in my country, Denmark, iPhones are most definitely affordable enough for pretty much anyone
In fact, in my anecdotal experience, it tends to be more trashy and lower class kids who use iPhones, due to them being the ones with a mindset of anything other than apple being inferior
These are the same people who blow their government money on Gucci and Supreme
/rant
I agree with a lot of the points I've read here - seperate plans/phone, lack of need for an American item, etc
The only thing I want to add is: the price 100% makes a difference
These kids might come from well-off families, but that doesn't mean their parents think buying a phone for them is worth the same as paying into their education
I went on an exchange which my parents paid for, but my parents would never even think to buy me an iphone because it's too expensive when you can get the same or better for less money
Exactly this
My kids use Message for everything, including school groups
Yes
But iOS still have the majority of market share in Denmark
It’s 53 to 47 or something like that
It will change eventually since the share is reversed in new phone sales
True
Apple products are for kids and grandmothers
Yes
I can decide, that I no longer like Huawei, Samsung or LG and just buy a phone from another company without losing my apps
I know they are different implementations of android, but my apps will still work on all of them, so I can buy from another company and keep my apps
The rest of Europe uses whatsapp
In DK and other Scandi countries, messenger is more used
But why the need to specify that it is an iPhone
It's just a phone
It's very normal
Half of my class is 20
***Some*** Americans see people with wealth as more important than those with less
A banker looks down on a garbage man, even though the latter is arguably much more important to society
Exactly this
Where I'm from, an Iphone is seen as you pay a price for the phone it self and then you pay an extra price for the brand on top of that
If you just want a phone with good specs, you don't buy an iphone, you buy a samsung
An iphone is also seen as a phone for people who isn't tech savvy
This is spot on with my boyfriend and I. He owns an iphone and is dumb as a door when it comes to tech, while I (F) own an android phone and always has, and is pretty tech savvy
Yeah
In Sweden, Norway and Denmark Facebook Messenger is the standard app to use for texting
Young people use it alongside Snapchat
I wouldn't say i'm ashamed but Copenhagen
It seems anytime there's a bad statistic about our nation, it because Copenhagen has dragged the average down
And almost everytime you hear about something fucked up happening, it happened over there
I get that with more people there's bound to be more crime, but it's become normal that whenever we hear about something crazy that happened in Denmark, we say: let me guess
It happened in Copenhagen
And 9 times out of 10 we're right
That's not to say that there aren't plenty of nice Copenhagians
I'm sure there are
It's just the only nice ones i've met, are the ones who move away to the rest of the country, because they say it's nicer here
Vollsmose
Pretty much one of the few (and first I believe) ghettos we have in Denmark
Randers is a big joke here, not because of architecture or blandness (like other examples ITT)
We just like to joke that the people there are a special type kinda like British chav/Russian gopnik type, they drive a moped or maybe even an old VW Golf with a big subwoofer, wear big sneakers and cap, and the biggest one - drink alchopops
[Randers starter pack]
Why is it called IJ
When I visited Amsterdam we stayed in IJburg
I was really impressed with the city planning but that’s another subject
Is it short for something
I went there on holiday a while back
I was shocked by the amount of trash and graffiti
None of that sounds bad, just non-mainstream
Is that really what people have against it
Because if so, that just sounds like progressive urbanite prejudice, more than anything
The same kind of prejudice that leads Copenhageners to discount all of Jutland and its people because of it being "the countryside".
I get disliking an industrial hellhole or a modern city that's 60% concrete housing-blocks and 40% parking-lots
Calling oneself ashamed of a small rural village being conservative and, well, rural, seems incredibly odd to me however
I haven't been to Aarhus since i was a small child visiting my grandparents, so i really can't say
I'm sure it's a nice place, but wouldn't be surprised if there are some streets where you should be a bit more careful if you go out after dark
Like in all big cities
You should ask the locals
Oh yeah the addidas suit is a big one
> The bad side is that a rather large part of Urk is very conservative,
Again, that's just blatant prejudice, though I suppose it may be perceived as the opposite through a certain lens
The women not voting seems rather extreme, though ultimately that is up to them
> The local government believes it's their place to actively surpress "anti-christian" messages
Judging by what you just said, and the rest of this thread, if the town and municipality is majority-Christian, that would seem entirely reasonable
Save the part with the immigrants I address below, none of their actions seem in any way offensive or harmful towards you or really anyone but themselves
They are living their own lifestyle, in their own rural community, and in a region that seems to be of like mind
This disdain is unwarranted, not to mention intolerant
> Like last year, when about a hundred Urker people gathered around the house of a Moroccan-Dutch family, making racist chants
This part I won't defend or play devil's advocate for
That is obviously terrible
And yes, xenophobia (and a certain prideful ignorance) is definitely a particular fault of the rural
Arrogance and priggishness tend to be the corresponding failings of the urbanite
> I base myself on voter behavior, church attendance and the type of Christianity that's popular in the village
I think you misunderstand me
I'm not denying they believe these things/act in that way
I am saying *that is perfectly fine*. Another user mentioned some far more serious charges - drugs, organised crime, even sex-trafficking
All that, if true, is reprehensible no matter what
But this is a different matter
> I vote for a progressive, secular party myself
I'd hate it if they'd threaten to shut down the theater because they allow plays that paints Christian family values in good light, or a comedian who mocks atheists
Live and let live
Yet the opposite is a much more real danger nowadays
What is the great lobby in the Netherlands shutting down secular/atheist events or diminishing their rights
Where even in Britain, or in Denmark
You can, probably, if you really dig, find a few examples
I needn't dig to find the inverse
Most of the time they won't even be true examples of oppression - being disapproved of in a community where most people don't agree with you isn't oppression
The inverse, however - the ostracising if not downright persecution of conservative voices, is far more common
And I don't mean libertarian faux-conservatives, I mean people like the types you described in Urk
You have nothing to do with them, yet your rhetoric towards them does not sound very live-and-let-live at all
Saying you don't tolerate intolerance is just empty word-games
On a great host of issues, [left-wingers are much more intolerant than right-wingers] They are far more likely to block people for posting things they disagree with, far less willing to have conservative friends than vice versa, more likely to be upset if their child married a conservative, etc, etc
So yeah, if you only focus on the issues on which leftists are more tolerant, then they are more tolerant
But if you focus on other issues - such as a basic willingness to speak to people you disagree with - they are *substantially* more intolerant
The degree to which the mere existence of old-fashioned communities like Urk seem to irk you (no pun intended) is simply more evidence of this
The simply truth is that intolerance of intolerance is just plain intolerance, disguised with a veneer of rhetoric and purple prose
Now that's definitely the part I'd have started with
The first part I don't mind (the people who do get offended by its very existence worry me very much)
That list, though, is rather more damning
All that in a rural municipality with only 20
000 people
That's almost impressive
There was a famous radioseries when i was a kid called "Kris og chokolade fabrikken", where Kris called his boss every morning with some hilariously insane excuse for why he couldn't come to work that morning

"The bridge was up" is common in Copenhagen if you are transporting to or from Amager

One of the first things I cover with my expat student is that, yes, even being 5 or 15 minutes late is rude in Denmark
But generally, these excuses above will be accepted as valid - especially in Copenhagen, I've found - due to the fact that trains and busses are almost always late, and traffic is often bad - even if you are on bike
In Copenhagen you can get away with just saying "I had to take the 5A bus" and people will be like: Fair enough, I'm surprised you weren't at least half an hour later
The 5A is even called "dødens rute" e.g. "The route of death/death's route" - it even says so on the bus line's wikipedia page, haha
I don't know about the rest of Denmark but in my city we always say "the bridge was up" as well
The city is devided on two sides of a strait, and if you live on  the same side as the place you're late to you of course say it anyways
This is also an excuse in Copenhagen, particularly between Amager and Sjælland
In Copenhagen we use "the bridge" too, even though they rarely open anymore
In Denmark the excuse is “The trains were delayed”. It happens so often that it’s believable
My favourite is the one with a really large binder blocking his way
If anything "My bus was late" or "I missed my bus"
In my town in Denmark we have paper, metal, plastic, glass, cardboard, organic and other
Also we can get leaves, twigs etc from the garden picked up, as well as electronics and larger items such as old furniture etc
I have a calender for trash pickup days
Yes, paper and cardboard are two different cans
Bulky items are picked up once a month and stuff from the garden twice a month (but not during winter, except for Christmas trees)
YES
I am in
My kids look at me, when I am separating the trash and ask "Is trash your hobby, mom
The old dude in the corner that seems to know best
Reality is that he doesn't but somehow he seems to get most right
He's highly paid but works very few hours, however whatever tasks he get is getting done on time but over budget
He is in general liked and does well with everyone, but in reality he doesn't really enjoy the company
He would prefer to be alone, but he's in it for the image and benefits
Farming pigs and pumping them full with medicine
Then putting them up for sale
It’s a whole crisis in my country
Cargo and Transport manager probably
Denmark is the bar owner
They’ll talk about your troubles and recommend help but mostly just give you good beer
He is also grumpy about not being part of the big decisions taken by the board
A long time ago he was actually a board-member before the company went through a long period of c-level politics, hostile take-overs and bad mergers
While he's actually better of now, less stressed and what not, he would really like to be asked about important stuff
Even though you didn't even have fax machines when he was in charge
This is shockingly true to form
That's practically cheating
It's supposed to be a place you can kick back and work on your cabin projects so you don't have to stay at home and work on your house projects
i've never cared
there's a lot of words americans use, that a britsh person wouldn't, and vice versa
i also prefer "color" over "colour". it's faster to write, it's easier to read, and it's fun to change the r, to an n.
[Someone said Euro English]
Not OP, but mine is an odd case
I use mostly American terminology, since I have American relations from whom I learned them
Yet I often pronounce said American words in a more British way
Sometimes, I use the "British" versions by coincidence
For instance, I say "sofa" and "coriander" instead of "couch" and "cilantro", not because of British English, but because those are the Danish words as well
An odd detail is that even though growing up, all the native English speakers I met were Americans, my accent has some uniquely British things
For instance, my accent is non-rhotic (no final Rs), but I do use the linking r, which I wasn't even conscious of until recently
I imagine I must have picked up a non-rhotic way of speaking from TV, despite speaking daily with rhotic-speakers
Strange
The streets were generally wayyy more dirty and filthy than they are in Europe, and the amount of homeless people were downright depressing
Also the sizes of everything you ordered from restaurants were completely unhuman lol
Also the inefficiency was surprising, you could easily spend half an hour queueing in shops or supermarkets, even though there weren't even that many costumers
But luckily, I found the regular people of America to be extremely polite and very talkative, and just nice in general
Strangers spoke to me
Just random "hello"'s and compliments
You mention extreme sizes yourself, and I can only agree
You’d think with all the talk of things being XXXL over there that you couldn’t possibly be surprised, right
oh boi
Size of Soda Cups sums it opup for me as well
I went to a Cinema while in Maryland and the small cup of Fanta I ordered was larger than the largest cup I’ve seen in Danish cinemas
Edit: Also public toilets in DC have giant holes all around the edge, apparently to deter drug use in them, felt super weird that anyone could just stare at you from outside it
Same, the amount of strangers that randomly talk to you is super uncomfortable for me personally
On the other hand, the first times I visited was before google maps and before we'd even gotten our maps halfway out our bags an american would approach and offer us directions
People in the US were just incredibly helpful and kind
The only other place I've consistently experienced people being that considerate of lost foreigners is actually Norway
In Denmark it's the other way entirely
Most Danes can't get themselves to call people "sir" or "miss", as everyone you'll meet is usually referred to on a first name basis
I don't even know the last names of most of my teachers
Here in Denmark churches are funded by a small (as in very small) church tax, that you are required to pay to participate in the Danish church (married, funeral, stuff like that)
Although I've been told that churches in the US are tax exempt, so I'd expect them to be more reliant on the individual churchgoer and less publicly funded, making the advertisements a good idea
You have la bise, many find that an excessively nice and too personal greeting for almost strangers, to relatively good friends
Norwegians definitely offered help when asked, but I've also had a ton of experiences with Norwegians just randomly approaching me first
A couple of years back a friend and I hiked from Trondheim to Hamar along the pilgrims route, we're both experienced hikers, with good gear and weren't even lost, but the second the weather got even a little bit bad we kept having norwegians stopping in their cars and offering a lift or waving as we passed their houses and inviting us in for something to eat and some shelter
I thought it was a fluke at first, but it kept happening
I left norway thinking norwegians are maybe the nicest people in the world
You have to call the King and Queen by their first names
They don’t have lastnames
The Crownprince of Denmark made up a lastname when he studied in the US
Yeah, I think it's a bit different too because the intent is to help not just chat
To be fair to the americans though, besides being too talkative they do the whole "being sincerely helpful" a lot as well
I love my country, and consider how reserved we are a peaceful and wonderful character trait
But we're just not that nice to anyone, including hikers, and that's a shame
After I got back from norway I figured if you guys could do it we can too, and I've tried to be more helpful to strangers without being asked since
I envy your gun laws
It's our queen's birthday
refused immigrants and 'illegal 'refugees  are still closed off in prison camps of several hundreds with several families, they cant keep social distancing and everybody is ignoring it
I know, still wrong
In Danish, we just spell it with one s so they are right on the money
If you got it, flaunt it, I guess
Many old names have started to become popular again
These ones are not so popular anymore:
For women: Dorthea, Ingeborg, Oda, Edith, Leonora
For men: Holger, Frode, Verner, Olaf
I know this is a bit of topic but I remember when Kevin Costners movies were super popular in Spain and some mothers would name their kids Kevin de Jesus
I always thought it was funny
`Peder` is pretty old
Very popular before `Peter` replaced it
Male names: Per, Henning, Poul/Povl, Henrik, Jens, Wagn, Ib, Steen
Female names: Åse, Ingrid, Gertrud, Inger/Inge, Margrethe
Ruth for women and Ernst for men
Halfdan - legendary Viking king who was father to Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye, who was father to Hardeknud, who was father to Gorm, the first (verified) king of Denmark (ca
Year 985)
The name means “The Half-Dane” and first appears in the sagas describing the Viking raids in England
The name is still used and is somewhat common, cong into and going out of style as it generations change
..and just as I finishen typing I discovered that Ragnar (after Ragnar Lodbrok, father to Halfdan) is making a comeback
Those names aren't German, though
Thoralf has never been a German name
The hypothetical German version would be something like "Doneralb"
Chantal and Jacqueline were given a terrible after-life in American trailer-trash and British working-class naming conventions
Believe it or not, I know someone who named their newborn kid Ilie a few years ago
Here, Nikolai would most likely be someone very young, interesting
> Aksel, Ilmari (maybe)
The Koskela names
Oh yes, they are a couple, that my wife knows from highschool, that suddenly turned "burn your passport because the chip has a sequence with 666 in it" religious
Some friends I have won't even take out the garbage in the evening or on mondays
Yeah, I don't know anyone else who can match that level of superstition
I think it's great
Should have happened 30 years ago, but better late than never
I hope to see governments and other industry do the same
ALL the time
I go to an international IB school, so I always speak english at school
Sometimes when I have to get the bus home, I have to get the driver to repeat what they're saying a few times before I'm back to danish again
Not English in particular, but sometimes when I've been in a foreign country for sufficiently long, all the Danish ads and road-signs look like gibberish at first for a few days after returning
Students at higher education are paid 830 euro a month by the government
Denmark has the world's oldest monarchy
(Edit: not true
Second oldest
Japan has the oldest
I have been lied to
The highest point in Denmark is 172 m above sea level
In northern Denmark (Grenen) you can see two seas meeting, with waves coming from two sides
We have most pigs pr capita in the world
Around four times as many pigs as people
Denmark has the oldest flag in the world
Denmark, while usually seen as a small country, is technically the 12th largest country in the world by landmass, because of Greenland
For the same reason, Denmark also has the 4th longest coastline in the world
Denmark is one of two countries in the world to have more than one national anthem, the other being New Zealand
Denmark is one of two countries in the world to have no official or unofficial national day, the other being the United Kingdom
Denmark has the oldest flag still in use
The first ever military bombardment on civilians happened in copenhagen
We have three extra letters in our alphabet
Viking culture originated in south jutland
Danes invented the first ever light machine gun (the madsen 03)
Why are you using American numbers
> Austria can be translated as The Mythical Dwarf Of The East
Sorry to say, but "Austria" is just the latinised form of Österreich/*Ostarrîchi (Old High German)
It isn't from Proto-Germanic, which was spoken some 500 years earlier
As Wikipedia says, it may have originated as a translation of the Latin name *Marcha Orientalis*, that being the earliest name of the province of the Holy Roman Empire later called the Margraviate of Austria
There was a Dwarf in Old *Norse* mythology called Austri, as part of a set of Dwarfs named after the cardinal directions, but that has nothing to do with Austria
As you say, Österreich means "eastern realm", because it was a border province, but "Austria" is just a latinisation of that word
I think Japan considers their monarchy to be older
Anyway, although several countries lay claim to having the oldest flag, the flag of Denmark is widely considered to be the oldest existing flag in the world
Officially, the flag is known as Dannebrog and traces its history back to at least 1219
The agreement [as you can see here if you scroll down a little] was not really fair as it gave Norway the ritchest oil fields while denmark got only a little bit
But maybe ot was good after all, what is Norway goong to do when the world realises that oil is not really going to work anymore
None of it is a loan
You can get a low interest loan on top of it
Yes
A very flat country
Yeah :)
Well, if we include the whole Kingdom of Denmark, there is Gunnbjørn Fjeld in Greenland
It is 3694m and the highest mountain north of the Arctic circle
It is a nunatak, a rocky peak protruding through glacial ice
Actually I just learned that Japan has the oldest monarchy and Denmark's is only second oldest
The first king of Denmark is Gorm the Old from 958 and there has been a king or queen since then
[The danish monarchy dates back to year 939]
Yes, Austria isn't rooted in Latin - it's a rendering of the Germanic word *Ostarrîchi* into Latin
That is, it's rooted in Germanic but transliterated into Latin spelling
I believe you have misunderstood the quote - it isn't saying the name Austria is connected to the dwarf Austri, it's just listing him as an example of a cognate from the same root *austar
- [Proto-Germanic] "*austrą" > [Old Norse] "austr" -> the dwarf Austri
- [Proto-Germanic] "*austrą" > [Old High German] "ōst" -> the province Ostarrîchi/Austria
But the quote is wrong to say that it's Proto-Germanic
The first documented use of the word "Austria" comes from 1147, which is long after Proto-Germanic times
In fact, it isn't even Old High German - it's Middle High German, in many ways more similar to modern German than PG
It's because of the citizens' rights directive which dictates that if you're working in any EEA country you are entitled to the same benefits as a native
I doubt that people will take you in like that
Danes are somewhat reserved
But we have hostels and bed&breakfast etc
That a airline commercial is actually anti-white Marxist propaganda meant to destroy white culture and spread cultural Marxism
First thought I "english grammar is the same as danish", just subject+verb+object
But  so remembered I "inversion". Thereafter came I in thought about that danish do have different grammatical rules
However, the most danes cannot remember them, they do them just
That is what I well like by danish
How goes it
This here sounds very hard to do, but I try it anyways
Luckily learn we english in a very early age in Denmark, so this here should not be very hard
Nevermind, it was it
**From Danish to English, version 1 (every word translated directly, but not in a confusing way):**
I have written this message on Danish first, and so translated each word to English for, so widely as possible, to preserve the words original placement in relationship to each other
I joys me to to see what the outcome of this little linguistic experiment becomes, when I once get translated these words
Such a good and fun idea you have gotten OP
It is enormously entertaining to read they others comments in the thread, and cool to get an insight in how other people naturally structure their sentences
Bothered know which influence it has on our individuel worldview, that we perceive language so different from each other
&#x200B;
**From Danish to English, version 2 (every word translated directly, but in a more confusing and comical way):**
I have written this message on Danish first, and so over-put every word to English for, so widely as possible, to conserve the words original placement in for-hold to each other
I joys me to to see what the out-fall of this small language-straight experiment stays, reaches I one-walk sheep over-put these words
Such one good and funny idea you have received OP
That is enormously under-holding to read they others comments in the thread, and fat to recieve one inside-aim in how other humans natural structure theirs sentences
Bothered know which inside-flow that has on ours individuel world-sight, to we up-understand language so different from each other
&#x200B;
**The original message in Danish:**
Jeg har skrevet denne besked på dansk først, og så oversat hvert ord til engelsk for, så vidt som muligt, at bevare ordenes originale placering i forhold til hinanden
Jeg glæder mig til at se hvad udfaldet af dette lille sproglige eksperiment bliver, når jeg engang får oversat disse ord
Sikke en god og sjov idé du har fået OP
Det er enormt underholdende at læse de andres kommentarer i tråden, og fedt at få en indsigt i hvordan andre mennesker naturligt strukturerer deres sætninger
Gad vide hvilken indflydelse det har på vores individuelle verdenssyn, at vi opfatter sprog så forskelligt fra hinanden
&#x200B;
**How I would translate the original message:**
I have written this message in Danish first and then translated each word into English so that I, as much as possible, keep every word's original placement in relation to each other
I'm looking forward to seeing what the outcome of this little linguistic experiment will be, once I have translated these words
What a good and fun idea you have had OP
Reading everyone's comments in the thread is really entertaining, and getting an insight into other peoples natural way of structuring sentences is pretty cool
I wonder what influence on our worldview it has, that we perceive language so differently from each other
I can really good like your idea
It is very fun to scroll through  this thread, but on my own language works it not so well
Hi, how have you all it
Handle you you okay under coronacrisis(the)
Not necessarily, on danish use we also backplaced articles, as on romanian
Our statesminister has for a couple days since announced new coronarestrictions out
I am sceptical on about people have think them to follow them, but I hope on the best
Definitely, you gotta draw the line somewhere
It's made a bit complicated by the history of FIFA, though
Corruption and shady business has been thoroughly normalized and begrudgingly tolerated (when not cheered on) as long as international football has existed, so there is a deep-rooted culture of "well, FIFA gonna FIFA" in football, which makes any single event, like Qatar's World Cup, a bit less of a standout atrocity
I agree completely
Our last Prime Minister were asked about the then new tax regulations, and said: "We've chosen to create a system where you will deliver a little more less, than before, that's our choice, and that leads to them, who earns most, and earns most, and now delivers a little more less
Yes, they'll deliver more less, than them who earns a little bit less, and delivers less, but then delivers less less
Extremely confusing and it was a big meme for a while
They should be closed haha
118 Danish people caught covid-19 at the same resort in Austria
Or it well, speeds up the process, so you get through it faster
At least that's how I always think Sick Sauna goes
Hey now, we're very much familiar with mountains
It's probably bred to not be super intoxicating
It's called travelling
Most of you swedish people live just as far away from mountains as we do ;)
I think that's also the purpose of it
Sure some people will go like "wow, weed can be my medicine, that's sick brah", but since the majority of the population isn't stoner dudebros, an alternative is needed
Also it's not necessarily the THC that has he medicinal effect, but some other non-intoxicating compound
So breeding and selecting for a high concentration of the other compound might lead to lower THC levels, while making it a better, more powerful drug towards a certain kind of problem
No, of course not :)
Actually,  one of our Queen's names is the Icelandic *Þórhildur
When she was born, her grandfather was king in the Kingdom of Iceland
Queen Margrethe II or Margrethe Alexandrine Þórhildur Ingrid
(The Denmark-Iceland union was abolished in 1944 and Iceland became a republic)
No, not really
Ireland on the other hand
Just kidding, I am reminded of Ireland every time I watch a goalless football match
Well it's not exactly like Denmark played great football in those matches either
It takes two to tango
I guess part of the reason was that Denmark had more to loose than to win in a few of those games
I think it's good, it means that Dennark goes through if they play in Ireland :) also, as a Dane the World Cup qualifier decider match that ended 5-1 was a delight
I will support rail ways going anywhere if it can limit flight usage
Honestly, I think the Balkans are too poor and too sparsely populated to support a high-speed rail network at the moment
It would end up being a very uneconomical project, that would require massive amounts of government subsidies, especially considering the mountainous topography of the Balkans
And even disregarding the cost of building the infrastructure, such a network would probably still be running at a loss just from operational costs
If the EU wants to help that region, there are be better ways to spend the money
The airport in Sofia is in severe need of an upgrade, for instance
If it means we get to tax the shit out of air travel and put the money into HSR hell yeah I would support it
> I'd support high speed railways anywhere
High-speed railways on Antarctica, let’s go
Well, that’s good
That place was so worn out and overcrowded last time I was there
Next they can maybe build a train to the airport
Also, the whole tram network in Sofia needs to be either completely overhauled or replaced
There are so many places where money could be better spent than on high-speed rail
Well, it's not like there don't exist alternatives to flying
They are just a bit slow
The fact is that high-speed train service is a bit of a luxury
And I don't think it's something the region should prioritize right now
I mean, even here in Denmark, we still don't have a single high-speed rail line, and we manage anyhow
Even with a high-speed train, I think very few would take the train from Western Europe to the Balkans
And as for regional tourism, it’s still quite an uncommon phenomenon in most of Eastern Europe, as can be witnessed by the relatively small airports there (the airport just here in Copenhagen is significantly bigger than the biggest airport in the all of the eastern EU states (which is Warsaw Chopin))
I search for my country, Norway or Sweden cause ik it's gonna be following
Depends
I'll probably look for danish comments if I have something to contribute with in a country specific question, but other than that Ioften skip danish comments
I don’t know about others but I get danish ads about sendings food to poor Africans
However the ads are mostly on YouTube so I don’t know about tv only Danes
It’s however less prevalent than in the past and commercials and ads are actually way less than say 10-15 years ago
It might be because Africa is views as developing fast and a lot better and richer than in the past
They usually send them in television around dinner time, so you can feel really bad and lose your appetite
I feel like it was more common in the 00s, but they still pop up here and there
Yes
We always get ads about saving poor people in African countries
It's often used as an argument against not eating your food, "Think about the starving children in Africa
" That's what they say
Almost all Europeans think of Africa as a continent without any food or water
Despite countries like Rwanda & South Africa are literally equal to European countries
Seriously
Tyrol must really care then
Is life really regarded as bad in Russia
I thought people lived their lives fairly well there
Russia can be terribly poor in some locations
I drove through a lot of villages on the outskirts of St
Petersburg, and they looked as if no one had been living there for 70 years
Homes were half rotten and some windows were even smashed, yet people still lived in them
Then as we drove into the city itself, everything looked like any other wealthy European city
Russia can change between poor and rich VERY fast
Just heavy advertisement then
What are the richest areas of Russia and what are the poorest areas
Generally, the richest are Moscow and St
Petersburg, but even for St
Petersburg the divide is huge
I am not familiar enough with Moscow to add anything specific about it though, but fairly certain it has a similar divide
Source: I am in St
Petersburg roughly 6 times a year, since my girlfriend lives there, so I have seen it first-hand a lot
My girlfriend does ok, but is in no way well-off
Ok thanks for explaining
It's common enough to encounter words that the first time you hear them sound a bit too much like an unimaginative Dane having a lazy guess at the English translation: "landscape", "yuletide", "ransack" etc
The word "doppelgänger". Straight up stolen, and also very similar to Danish "dobbeltgænger".
In Danish "spanioler" is kind of derogative and/or old
Now we use spanier
And depending on the pronunciation of polak (Polish person) it could also be derogative
Yeah I know it's just borrowed, I'm only joking
I think English is a wonderful language
Thats the exact same in Danish
POlak (stressed First syllable) is by some people percieved(?) as derogatory, while poLAK is okay
They discontinued the physical catalog last year here in Denmark
No, we didn't have IKEAs where I used to live so I've never seen such a thing
I don't really care about the Christmas creep, though it puzzles me that the people who complain about it don't seem to realize that they're the ones keeping it alive
First they talk about how much they hate Christmas decorations and then they buy some peppernuts and vaniljekranse (Danish Christmas cookies) anyways because they love the taste of them
If there wasn't a demand, there wouldn't be a supply
I hate snow and always drive a couple of hours to see family at Christmas, so I've been pretty happy with the mild winters we've had recently
(Although it doesn't please me that we had wintery weather in March in 2018 and snow in May this year)
Gotta get that last Euro before everyone dies
No anti-German sentiment in Denmark
I did have one funny incident
In Denmark our sirens are tested once a year
They date back from WWII when people had to seek shelter during bombings
My German collegue commented "What are those
We don't have those in Germany
What are you afraid of
" Yeah, well
Not anymore in Denmark
Its almost the opposite
You can’t blame those who weren’t born
And Germany still puts much blame on it self
And it has to stop, so they can have a future without being/feeling blamed for the past
I learned about the holocaust and the third reich's human right violations at an very early age (11) And I used to straight up hate the Germans for it
I know hate is a strong word, but it was beyond disliking
But as I grew older, I started to take more [Infomation] on what the Germans had done to redeem them self
That hatred is still in me, but it's targted at Neo-Nazis and not Germans
Hell, Germany is a country I could maybe one day, settle in
Danes tend to really like their German tourists
They're polite, patient and considerate - FAR better than most other tourists
Only thing I've heard Danes talk negatively about regarding Germany is when Merkel encouraged migrants and refugees to enter Europe, leading to the crisis in 2015
Overall, we see no correlation between the current population of Germany compared to those during the 30s and 40s.
Not really, people may hold grudges against the language, or joke that "it's the Germans again" when the sirens are tested, but overall people tend to be more neutral or slightly positive
There was an issue a few years ago, though, where the mayor of Haderslev wanted a bilingual Danish-German city sign to accommodate the minority in the area, and was met with furious resistance and nation-wide media coverage
The sign didn't last many days before it was stolen
Most Anti-German sentiment seems to have disappeared here in Denmark, but we seem to have adopted more of a mentality of "Forgive but remember".
I have a lot of family in the southern part of Jylland, that came under German occupation in 1864
My great grandfather was one of them, and at the outbreak of the 1
world war he was forced to fight for the Germans
He was shot in the leg, but survived and was found by french soldiers, who he was thankfully able to convince that he was Danish
He lost the leg but went back and witnessed the reunification of southern jylland following the war
While it may have taken him a few years to get over some anti-german sentiment, he still took in German children and housed them at his farm following the 2
world war, when a lot of them came to Denmark to avoid famine, as we weren't hit by the wartime devastation
There seem to already then be this mindset of wanting to see an end to conflict
Essentially, the Anti-German sentiment seemed to take a different turn already in the years just after the war, and over the years I think most danes have largely forgiven the Germans, even if we still meme about reclaiming the remaining land we lost way back in 1864
Absolutely not
The germans of today are friendly, funny and very kind
Us in denmark are very fond of our southern neighbours, and I think they like us too
Seems like they still be invading us every summer
So I guess there is only sentiment against their being too many of them at our beach
Not really, Danes and Germans generally get a long well, if there is any sentiment that is anti German it isn't because of the nazis
Because they drive as fast as a bloody hawk can nose dive
It's a mandatory subject they teach you in school so amongst 5th to 9th graders here then yes
Other than that no
The most anti-german sentiment is when they clog the roads, heading for the nearest beach in summer
..and then require helicopter rescue because they fall asleep floating on an air mattress and wake up halfway to England
They *do* spend a lot of money here, though, so it's all fine
(and get to pay for the helicopter too)
Actually, that’s not entirely true
It just depends on location, I think
I grew up just south of the border, and my mother put all of us in the danish private schools
I took part in some student exchanges, and have lived in Odense for 12 years
I stayed after finishing university
So, suffice it to say, I have some experience with being German in Denmark
The longer I live here, the less it’s been a problem
Occasionally, people still bring it up when they recognize my accent, but it’s rarely negative anymore
However, the further east I’ve been, the more negatively people react
We had an exchange in 10th grade with a class from Farum
They were very biased
They stayed with us for a week, and then we stayed with them for a week
While they visited us, they kept yelling about nazis whenever we were outside unsupervised
They constantly made comments, and once even verbally attacked a passing elderly man
And I know that some might think that that’s just teenage stupidity at work
And we thought so, too, until we visited them
They’re parents and teachers showed us pretty clearly where they’d gotten it from
The teachers gave them weird assignments, like “draw a German”, which resulted in like twenty drawings of skinheads
My host family fed me nothing but sauerkraut and pickles, and I wasn’t allowed to touch their cat
That was definitely the worst experience, but it’s not exactly an exception
While most others were a lot less obvious, it’s still been pretty clear to me that there are plenty of people who have certain expectations when it comes to Germans, or specific associations
I’d say that 3 out of 4 people I met in the beginning kept asking me about work morals, being humorless, beer, sausages, and whatever other stereotypes they may hold
And usually I joke about it, and say that I had to leave Germany because I don’t like beer
But I’d be lying if I said that it didn’t bother me sometimes
>they are a great tool to warn the public if there is a catastrophic event
..which is exactly what they're used for in Denmark
Hear a siren
Seek cover (get inside a building), close doors and windows, and get more information from local radio/TV/Internet
She is from München, I think
Or when they let their kids play on an air mattress in the ocean
There are accidents too often
Those things belong in pools
I am so sorry to hear that
Unfortunatly Danes are weird with people, who are different from them, not just Germans
My husband is from Copenhagen and the amount of thrashing and "teasing" he got from my family in Jutland was embarrasing
I faced some stereotyping from his family too, being from Jutland and moving to Copenhagen
I can understand that it bothers you
We used to do it every Wednesday, but now it is only the first Wednesday of May
Weird choice, too, because occationally that will be on May 5th, where we celebrate the ending of German occupation so the sirens are a bit out of place
It just gets old pretty fast
My husband never treated me like that, and it’s one of many things I love about him
And I did make friends here
It’s just almost exclusively other non-Danes
I have many friends from the muslim community, who were exceptionally welcoming
I was even invited to some weddings
And other expats, from Wales and America
All in all, I love living here, and I don’t have any intention of moving back to Germany
I really does get old
We get "Devil Island" for Sjælland all the time by people from Jutland
It's some weird inferior syndrome I guess, which might also apply to the stupid people, you have met
In Denmark a lot of people drive to Germany to shop for candy, soda and Nutella
Therefore a lot fo Danes believe that Nutella is German, because the price is a third of what it is en Denmark, but Nutella is also Italian
EDIT: Spelling
Maybe not a mismatch, but not a lot of people realise that LEGO is Danish
I also don't think a lot of people know that some stories they know are old fairytales from Denmark, such as "The little mermaid" and "The ugly duckling"
Ribena is a part of the Japanese conglomerate Suntory, originally from the Medico company GSK in the UK
I always thought it was Danish just like me, due to good branding and marketing
I some how thought it was Norwegian, as Spar in both my own language, and in Norwegian means "To save" (monetarily)
Ehm
What
I never knew that, how is sounding Danish a business strategy
Also, like u/Pistollium wrote, we do not use ä but æ, and they do sound similar
We also rarely use z, and never zs
This is just a very bad imitation of Danish
Except that Häagen-Dazs in no way sounds Danish
I honestly don't understand how anyone with access to the internet could ever think it does
To me it sounds vaguely German
If it was supposed to sound Danish they would've called it "Hansen-Is" or something
I think there are still stores with only women’s clothing
There was one close to me until a few years ago
Denmark has two beer brands called Maribo and Harboe, I can understand why he thought it was Danish
I thought too when I was a kid
It just sounds like a Danish place name
Also, they have different products in different countries, so there are no real giveaways
I've heard of problems with the Norwegian Rema 1000, and it's funny that it's the complete oposite in Denmark
Rema 1000 is one of our best supermarkets
Haha, in Denmark "Royal Copenhagen" is our "national" brand of porcelain - [
I get your point, but it almost seems insulting to us
Might as well have called it Creamy LEGO
When I was a kid I thought Ikea was Danish because their logo was red and white
They changed it to blue and yellow later on though which I thought was weird
That's interesting
Must have been late 90s, early 2000s when they changed it here in Denmark
At that time IKEA also had its headquarters in Denmark before it moved to the Netherlands
Corportate taxation was lower in Denmark than in Sweden at the time
>  Is it working out well or would it be a bad idea for the U.S?
Yes
Healthcare is seen as a right in most of Europe
Similar to the freedom of speech or religion
The state has the obligation to provide healthcare to its citizens
There are some failings like any system, but it works great for the most part
However this is our worldview and our mentality on healthcare
I can't say it would translate well into the American context
For me many Americans are selfish and don't seem to understand or don't want their taxes to go towards healthcare
I've seen people say they don't want to pay for someone else's surgery or whatever
They totally miss the point that everyone else is also paying for your surgery if/when you need it
That maybe paying a bit more in taxes could lift the quality of life for so many millions
I also have a feeling that 'this late in the game' universal healthcare is doomed to fail in the US at this time because people's opinions and behaviors are already set and their mind is made up
The older generations especially seem hung up on the details
I've always thought the "if you break your leg, live in a lifetime of debt" thing was so stupid
It would be great for them
In Denmark we have "free" healthcare and it works pretty well but it comes with a price, we pay more in tax, but in the long run its worth it
Yep, and I think no European country has a system, that covers all the things Bernie is proposing his plan should cover
Denmark have free healthcare as in a national health insurance
You get it automatically from birth
Prescription medicine is subsidized in a way that it gets cheaper the more you buy
Going to a dentist is not free as an adult but is subsidized to some extent
We have a few private hospitals which can do simple operations, so you can buy private insurance enabling you to get faster back for work
There is also a private association, which helps you reimburse different things, if you are a member:
Sygeforsikringen "danmark" is an association of 2
5 million members
This form of ownership makes "danmark" a non-profit-making organisation
"danmark" reimburses more than 350 kinds of medical expenses, including:
* Medicine
* Dental treatment
* Glasses/contact lenses
* Physiotherapists
* Chiropractors
* Psychologists
* Vaccinations
* Clinical dieticians
I just want to add that the standard vaccinations are free
Your GP is also free
And things like chiropractors and physiotherapists can be subsidized
I recently received treatment at a physiotherapist, which was 23 euro (170 kr) per session
No but it's still selfishness because you (politicians, voters, etc) can't put aside differences to implement a system that could improve millions of lives
No one wants to work or agree on anything with the 'other side' (speaking Democrat vs
Republican')
- This is purely selfishness from pride and political dogma
It's the two party system that breeds gridlock and ineffectiveness from selfishness
Bernie's M4A includes dental coverage for everyone
That's not the case here, Denmark, the country Bernie supposedly wants to emulate
I just went to the dentist an hour ago, and I can show you the bill
It was just a check up, and I will get it all refunded by my private health insurance
I also picked up some asthma medicine, and while it's eligible for rebates, it's still like 100 euro for 3 months dose
You don't pay if you go to the GP or to the hospital, but dental is only free for kids(under 18) and is super expensive for everyone else
There's a yearly cap, so you'll never spent more than 2000 DKK(roughly 250 euro), so next time, it will be cheaper
It is, but that's how it is here
>Yeah, Bernie Sanders wants to get rid of private insurance companies as well
I don't understand why this is necessary
As long as it's not necessary to have a private insurance, what does it accomplish
>Why don't people fight for getting dental covered under universal healthcare
Because extended dental care is really down the list of people's concern
Also if you are poor and receive benefits, the state pays all expenses up untill 10000 dkk per treatment
Yes, always
Our tapwater is near perfect
The only thing that's stopping me from doing it in other European countries is that horrible chlorine taste in some places
Very common, our tap water is considered some of the best in the world
I would never buy water unless it's free with my take-away meal
Tap water is the shit
Always tap water
I find it interesting though as you travel around the country, the water flavor can change
The best water I ever drank was at my grandfathers house who had dug his own well and got his own ground water
It was icy cold and incredible
In towns the water can be a bit
Does it make sense to call water bland
Water doesn't taste of much of course, but like in my flat I never have like ice cold water unless I put it in the frigde for later
From  the tap it is always
Well normal tempatured  and doesn't have that same thrist  quenching feel that my grandfathers  own well water did
Worst water is in Copenhagen
That water has flavor, and in an odd way
But I believe most people still drink it
Denmark has some of the best tap water in the world
Mostly due to our soil, great at filtering and regulating
I actually only drink tap water, bottled can have harmful chemical in the for it to taste good
Not touching that
We drink tap water in Denmark, I feel like it's something we take great pride in, but I've noticed depending on where you are it can taste slightly differently
Some even have taps with both normal and carbonated water if they're rich enough/live at the new Nordhavn
Every time we've gone to a foreign country it seems like they use bottled water for the most part
I love the German love affair with carbonation
Sparkling water seems so common in Germany, and of course you have Apfelschorle
Why anyone likes that is beyond me, but to each his own
Prost
Best or not best aside, Danish tap water is still, at least domestically, considered better, and cleaner than most bottled water which is often polluted by the plastic bottle itself
Tap water contains no clorine or any other chemical cleaning agents so the taste is mostly good
The hardnesses varies a lot depending on regions and some of it has a lot of lime, but everybody drinks it and uses it for cooking
It's typically better outside the cities and Copenhagen has the worst water, although still fully drinkable
Bottled water is mostly only used for the convenience of the bottle, and almost nobody drinks it at home
Some rural towns has their own private wells, because clean drinkable water can be pumped up directly from the ground
Supermarkets does carry bottled water, but not a lot, and rarely in larger quantities
[yes, really
If you ask Google, the first hit says Denmark is number 1
It clearly depends on which source you look at then, ecauee just by a quick google i found several sources (most governmental or NGOs) that claims the Danish tap water is amongst the best in the world :)
> that it's off the grid of the mile washing machine support sheet
Welcome to the entire nation of Denmark
Danish water reigns supreme
If Iron doesn’t float in my water, I'm not drinking it
Yeah, Google results are probably heavily biased depending on your location
Nevertheless, the tap water here is not chemically treated, only filtered (often with sand filters) and oxidized before reaching the consumer
So there is no chlorine or other stuff added that can give a bad taste
In my mind, that equals pretty good quality, but I won't claim it's "the best in the world", which is of course also very subjective
I mean sure, but most the sources I found weren't danish, but sources like WHO etc
I fully agree
If I can't overdose on calcium from my water, why even drink it
All the time
Most recently I forgot what a sink in Danish was called
Not a **huge** no, but please don't call people Mr/Ms [LastName] unless they're old enough to have experienced the Napoleonic wars
Practically everyone in Denmark is on a first name basis, up to and including the prime minister
Different rules for the Queen, but if you chance upon the Crown Prince in an informal setting, he prefers the informal tone, too
Bragging is VERY frowned upon here
Alot will cite the law of Jante should you do it, and even more people will think of it
The law of Jante is basically a long list of sentences which exclaim that you are nothing compared to the collective
Examples
"You are not more than us
"Don't think you are smarter than us
If you think of the ten commandments but all centered around you being small and nothing then you're more or less there
Don't think you are better than others
Example; don't bring up how much money you make, if you make a lot
We are generally humble and don't like people who are even remotely trying to brag or try to seem better than others
This is also what's called The Law of Jante
Some people don't like it, but to me it doesn't mean that you are a bad person for being smart, successful, talanted or rich - it just means that those things don't define our value as humans; we are all equal
It was a big no no for swedish people to cross “østersøen” if it was frozen, danes had the right to beat them with a stick
Cutting in line, Denmark really likes to follow that kind of rules and you'll get stared at
Talking to random people in shops/public areas
Danes are very private people
It's not ok to be loud in public places, unless it's in the middle of night and you are drunk ( it's still bad, but most of us have been there)
This is just a nordic thing but dont call danes “norwegians” or “swedish” and reverse
Jesus no
That's a quick way to never get invited in again
I visited the Sachsenhausen camp once
That people can show that kind of disrespect baffles me
I felt so much sorrow being there, and I think it's so good of germans to show what happened back then
This is so true
My local pizza place is run by some really nice younger guys and when they hand me my order they always say: "værsgo Hr
" (Here you go, Sir
) and it always weirds me out even though I know they're just being polite
Yeah I know I'm about 20 years your senior and my hair and beard is greying, but come on
I'm not *that* old
Nobody is "dus" with the queen, except for close friends and family
Everybody else is "dis"
I don't know how to translate it to English, but for a couple of generations ago, you had to have permission to address people directly, and if you didn't have that permission, you would be politely but sternly told that you weren't that close, and to keep a social distance
Teamachine salesman: It really takes the misery out of making tea
Mrs
Doyle: Maybe I like the misery
Us barbaric northern Europeans
That's the only time I do it too
When I was little my siblings and I would sometimes ask for spaghetti with ketchup and a clump of butter mixed in
Yup, I remember when I went on a school trip to Serbia
About 7 years ago
The victim complex was still very much alive
I've never heard so much criticism towards NATO before, and I move in some pretty leftist anti-imperialist circles at home
At my workplace many people wear name tags with only their last name
I basically cannot make myself address someone by their last name so when I first meet someone I hope intensely I won't need to say their name
I also don't generally introduce myself or ask them their name but that's just regular ol' social awkwardness
Dus all the way around
Dude, speaking with the queen is a whole mini-course upon itself
At my old place of work we had to send our camera crews to court for approval by her staff, and to lean to address her correctly
This is common in a lot of counties, but I would imagine even more in France due to the sheer size of Paris
We Danes are also more or less forced to move to Copenhagen
Very true words I guess people just want validation all the time
Ah the luas
Reminds me of my vacations in Dublin
Stayed at the Gibson Hotel at The Point, and every day we would jump on the luas and spend the day in the city
Absolutely love Dublin and I hope I get to visit again soon
I wonder who was the first brave soul that started uttering blasphemies in a way that it caught on
To see and understand how ethnic minorities are integrated different places in Europe
We also went to south France to talk with occitans
There are always exceptions, but apart from "When addressing a superior in the Army" or "Addressing another member of parliament from the speaker's stand" you're good
I'm dus with my boss, and the CEO
I've been dus with every politician I've ever met (I met quite a few when I worked in broadcast media), and if I were to meet with the current or former PM and/or some of the ministers I'd be dus with them too
Scandinavian countries' number of medals at the Winter Olympics
Danish youth are the one that drinks the most alcohol (in Europe or the World
Coudnt find a definite answer), so we come last in healthy youth culture and soberism
But we finish first in the summer olympics :)
I know
But we are very hard to become friends with and we talk about the weather all the time
And we drink a lot
I'm gonna disagree with your take on heavy metal
Yeah, we haven't struck it big as Norway has, but the metal scene here produces some amazing things
I know for a fact that some of the members of Gojira love Düreforsög, and that Metallica at least during the Master of Puppets days had a close relationship with Artillery
Hell, that album is even recorded in Copenhagen
We haven't had snow for like 10 years, how are we supposed to practise
Was amazed by the CGI in that intro, but then I saw what the show was about holy shit
Rain, wind, Vikings, (sometimes) snow
Seems pretty Scandinavian to me
I can't speak highly enough of bands like düreforsög, LLNN, Wuthering Heights, Artillery and ORM as well
The front singer in Volbeat has even made some excellent death metal with his former band Dominus
Because the other Nordic children play so booooring
Oh yeah
I totally forgot to mention them
It should be the same, really
Well, the English seems rather proud of them being raided by Danes in the Viking Age, and they took our navy and terror bombed Copenhagen in the early 19th century, so I guess we're even
Beside the memes, we are generally polite towards the Swedish, when we meet them in person, but we have found other ways to get back at them
Germans are welcomed as tourists
We are no fans of the old Prussia and the war monger Bismarck though
Once, when I was in England on a school trip, we were given a guided tour around Oxford
The bloke showing us around was a pretty affable guy, and when he heard where we were from, he apparently decided to add an extra destination
So he took us to a nice church at the edge of the campus, and talked about its recent history for a bit
Then he mentioned that back in the 11th century, just after England finally switched back to English rule, the new king ordered every single Dane in the city (a healthy chunk of the population at the time) rounded up in the church, and then had the church burnt down
This was part of a broader pogrom about the Danish population at the time
Beyond the ethical aspect, this backfired pretty bad, since it so infuriated the Danes that Sweyn Forkbeard, the king of Denmark, invaded the year after, conquering England and ushering in decades of further Danish rule
I've worked with a couple of people from the balkans (originally refugees, now danish citizens), and judging by what they've told about balkan nationalism, holy shit there seems to be some issues to work out
Seems strange, because they all seem to be decent people
But i guess the genocidal maniacs don't get asylum up here
I think my favorite German movie is Die Welle
And, I think you are handling your history perfect - not your fault, but you have a collective German responsibility to remember and teach
>he was a good guy
He was a clever, strategic and ruthless politician
I once overheard an old man saying “she wasn’t the smartest knife in the cupboard”
I like the other version better
Should be required to watch it during school, after schindlers list - in all countries
You really should watch both, esp schindlers list, it is a GREAT movie
Once you get south of the Alps, life is more laid back
In many places, they still have siestas or long lunches, and there's a lot of socializing in the evenings
Northern work ethics value hard work and long hours over relaxation and enjoyment of life
I think stress has a much larger negative impact on life expectancy and general health than one might think
Why is Italy constantly on the verge of going bankrupt then
(Sorry if that is an exaggeration, but it's all you hear about Italy in our media)
But the NOK is weaker than the Euro, isn’t it
We run around school and throw caramels at the younger kids while we're dressed up in weird costumes
On the last day of public school, before the exams, we go around the school in costumes with bags of toffees and throw them to the others
This is usually accompanied by someone on the drums (or something else that makes noise) so the classes can hear when we are coming
When that’s done we put on a show for the whole school and then we took off to a theme park
I wish we had that here
I also really like your russ music
and water fights afterwards
Or Shaving cream or soap
They banned shaving cream at my school the year that I graduated, but we still used it anyways
Principal was fuming
Yes we do, and i don't know, it's fun :)
They replaced it with a giant soap foam machine last year for us, 150
m² fieldfilled with soap foam, nw that was fun
Sounds like a blast
Honestly the only one I can think of in Leslie Knope in Parks and Recs saying ["Denmark ødelægger alle"] which she honestly did pretty well
The biggest mistake is she says Denmark instead of Danmark - but considering she isn't supposed to be a Danish character, her Danish is much better than several of the examples in this thread of actors actually trying to portray characters from the countries
Honestly, I just don't think we are a country that's represented much in foreign media, haha
Ab Fab has a pretty funny scene though, of [the main character thinking she is speaking Danish, while speaking to an actual Dane
I would actually love feedback from Russian speakers on the three Danes that are always playing Russian:
- Lars Mikkelsen (does a mean Putin copy)
- Jesper Christensen
- Viggo Mortensen
But I have no idea about how good their Russian is
Only one that comes to mind is one of the last episodes of The Office where the documentary is being released in Denmark
They watch the intro on YouTube, and it's not even Danish, it sounds like some weird Swedish German hybrid
Doesn't happen often, but when it does, it sounds horrible
I can't blame them, no other country other than Denmark can do the Danish accent
And for Danish, no one is able to do that
I remembering visiting Russia in high school and meeting with a danish professor there who had studied danish more than 40 years
His danish accent was average at best
It's sort of comical that the whole plot of The Thing, which is actually a decent movie, hinges on a Norwegian scientist not being able to speak English lmao, since he basically reveals the whole plot in that scene
He sounds like a drunk Dane lmao
We have a fair amount of Danes pretending to be Russian :)
There's actually two movies about a Danish crown prince who goes to college in Wisconsin, and meets the love of his life
The second movie ends with her reciting the Danish constitution in Danish
All the characters are played by American/English actors/actresses and their Danish is so horrible it would have been a better movie if they had no lines through the whole movie
Peter Gantzler's accent in the first episode of The Last Kingdom is so overwhelmingly Danish I almost cried laughing
WRT Vikings, I was so distracted by the fact that every member of the same family had a different accent that I couldn't continue watching
I just couldn't un-hear it and it drove me nuts
Don't the Seal People in [The Eagle] speak Gaelic
I think I remember hearing Jamie Bell say in an interview that they had to learn it, or at least a language based on it
And German - like in Angels and Demons there's two Danes, one playing a German and one playing
something
I'm not sure actually, haha
It always surprises me how often Danes end up taking roles playing all other Northern nationalities
Edit: omg never mind, the other one is apparently playing a Muslim of Arab descent, according to the Dan Brown wiki
Also, apparently his hobbies are:
Killing
Raping women
Taking hashish
How did everybody not realize how trash these movies (and books, tbh) were when they came out
> How did everybody not realize how trash these movies (and books, tbh) were when they came out
This sounds snobby as hell, but I was honestly so confused when I read The DaVinci Code
It was such a clichéd and predictable mess
The plot wasn't a thrilling puzzle or even that complicated
It was full of awful stereotypes and 2-dimensional characters
I actually felt dumber having read it
And yet, so many people praised it for being amazing and engaging
I started to think there was something wrong with me, that maybe there was some deeper layer to it I wasn't getting
Then I read some reviews, did some digging, and came to the conclusion that Dan Brown is a shit author and people have bad taste
Yup
After having just had a quick look through the cast lists of Vikings and The Last Kingdom, there are far more Nordic names in The Last Kingdom cast
There may be a mish-mash of Danish/Norwegian/Swedish/Icelandic accents, but at least they're more authentic than "Hollywood Scandinavian".
Plus, it's more fun to play "spot the Swede" than "spot yet another Brit/American".
I was 13 when I read it, and thought I was the absolute shit for being able to follow it and figure out the clues
Then I started rereading it when I was older (22 maybe
) and realized I might have found it engaging as a kid, but as an adult I could feel it killing my braincells
It's just so bad
Yeah, at least it's over quickly
In Denmark it's tradition to say "how the hell are we hiking on a mountian
We don't have mountains, but if you are walking alone on a trail and you pass a person that walks alone too
On that rare occasion there is a possibility
Dane here
What are these moun-tains you talk about
You are forgetting our "Sky mountain" ([picture] It has recently been climbed by a Norwegian who wrote a book about it ([link]
Edit: But to answer the question: We often say "hvorfor helvede skal man betale for at parkere her
" which translates to "why the heck do we have to pay to park here
I went on a biking vacation this summer
We passed quite a lot of other people also out biking with tents and all
We were greeted every time with "god tur
" / "have a nice trip
". We quickly started greeting everyone we passed our selves
But apperently you do not greet people who were hiking or biking normally (commute), only people biking with bags, tent etc
Fun fact: Himmelbjerget isn't even the tallest "mountain" in Denmark
Or you can take the boat to the base camp located on an altitude of 21 meters
This part of the trip is actually really nice, provided the weather is fair
From there you can climb to the summit in 15 to 20 minutes
True
The highest point is right behind a barn and not that interesting, so we tend to ignore the fact
[Here's the picture]
Møgel is a pretty archaic word in Danish, coming from the Old Norse word "miklæ", meaning big or large, as in Miklagarðr(the large town), the Old Norse name for Istanbul
There's also a town in Southern Jutland called Møgeltønder
If I remember right, east of Great Belt, miklæ became "magle", and there are tons of placenames on Zealand, which has that in it
As a Swede also mentioned: in Scandinavia we like to leave babies outside in their strollers during nap time
When I was a kid we had Swedish kids shows (based on Astrid Lindgren’s works) that we’re dubbed by either an old dude or lady
I’ve never seen it for anything other than that though, and I couldn’t imagine watching a Tarantino movie with that kind of dub, but it sounds interesting lol
trusting people
We expose our children to a lot of stuff that would horrify some other countries
For instance there was the whole Giraffe autopsy in front of several school kids, for educational purposes
And another with a lion
We don't really baby proof our homes, except for a gate on stairs and a few other things
Sex and nudity has become more of a tabu, but we are still pretty open about it
Funny, I remember watching Pippi Langstrømpe and that it was just dubbed by some guy reading up from a manuscript
You could unfortunently still hear the Swedish ;)
We kinda have that in Denmark with Emil fra Lønneberg and Pippi
Is that weird
That's littereally the entire point of them
We have very good bike lanes everywhere
A proud tradition
Now we can even use the whole
When I was a kid there was no internet, no smartphones, or tablets
I love the horror that shows in their eyes
Glædelig jul til jer alle
Glædelig jul mods og allesammen ^_^
Glædelig jul og godt nytår
“A town in Russia” is something you didn’t care or think about
“Honestly, as a teenager, homework was a town in Russia to me”.
There's an old Danish expression "at leve på polsk".
It translates to live together like the polish and it means to live together while not being married
It's a weird expression because I could imagine living together without being married isn't very common in a predominantly catholic country like Poland
Take a cold turkish
(Tage en kold tyrker)
Means to take a brake from something
An addiction or a bad habit
The translation isnt that great
Swedish hair (svenskerhår), hair in a mullet (short choppy sides, longer back)
Also referred to as bundesliga hair (the German soccer league)
In Danish, ''to speak Swedish'' means that you are saying completely unintelligible things
dane here
Du store kineser (great chinese), an exclamation of shock and surprise
at tage en kold tyrker (taking a cold turk), quitting something abruptly instead of over a long time, like instead of using nicotine gum to quit smoking you just stop smoking
det er en by i rusland (its a town in russia), said about things you have zero knowledge on
cant think of any other atm, i'll add more if i remember them
Mullets are called svenskerhår - swede hair in denmark
“Festen var helt Texas” made me legit burst out laughing
We don’t say it in Danish but we honestly should
Also "at være græsk katolsk" / "to be Greek catholic". Meaning you don't care at all
Example: "do you want hotdogs or pizza for your birthday
"Eh, i am greek catholic"
>Pije jako Dán (He drinks like a Dane) - Someone who is drinking too much alcohol and behaves inappropriately
Is this a new(ish) expression from drunk Danish highschoolers
Or an old one
Came looking for this
There is seemingly no reasonable explination for the phrase
It's more that you abruptly stop doing something, I'd say
So instead of buying nicotine gum to quit smoking you just - stop
It’s from the English cold turkey
It sound like “kold tyrker” (cold Turk) in Danish
> I don't know the origin though
This is a guess
Maybe its about getting one bill with a higher amount for the customer and one with a lower for accounting
And the restaurant (or whatever) keeps the difference
Also I recently heard the Russian expression "Ispansky stid" = Spanish shame
The feeling of shame you get when you see someone else doing something shameful
En by i Rusland
“Hvis jeg skal være ærlig, så var lektier en by i Rusland for mig da jeg var teenager”.
Hmm I honestly thought it would have been a higher percentage
According to these [Danish statistics] from 2016 our numbers are about the same as Poland
It's in Danish but it should be easy enough to guess what the pictures mean
Bonus question
Are you guys allowed to get married at 15
And as far as I know the expression originally is from drug addiction
getting rid of it in one go instead of gradually
word traveld far it seems
EU members has to have a democracy
The simple thing would be Hungary kicking out themselves
No better time to enact Article 13 than the time where everyone is at home and on the internet
I understand Norwegian better then Sønderjysk or Bornholmsk
Sønderjusk is almost it's own language
When I was a kid, I had trouble understanding my grandfather from Langeland
I grew up around Silkeborg, and we only visited them on Langeland once every summer
I always had to look at my dad and get some signs from him to know if I should say yes or no when they asked me stuff
The hunter in this clip is also a good example:
Yea, i understood none of that
I thought I was just bad at understanding Swedish, but I’m glad I’m not the only one lol
Same here - honestly for a moment I was like: are they just talking gibberish and saying its Swedish
It was so bad
I think I've been ruined by living in Copenhagen for the last seven years - I'm practically half Swede by now
Tbh, my dad is a garbage man and I’ve been with him to work once
It’s a pretty fun/easy job and the pay is absolurely crazy here
That Denmark isn’t Disney land or a theme park
My country have problems too
I was in California and a lot of people thought that Denmark was communist and that it was close to New York
Danish isn't that hard to learn, people say like some kind of mythical old timie language
I've had to explain to someone from Copenhagen that;
Yes I have internet
Yes I know what youtube is
All ways have to tell people that I'm not from Holland, I don't really know why people think Holland and Denmark is the same thing
I had to explain to a bunch of people in England that polar bears do not roam the streets of Denmark
But Legoland
Every time I talk to people outside of Europe that is basically what they think is all there is
LEGO and Legoland
I agree
Of course, as any person should do, be polite
It's not going to be any use not doing so
The impatient drivers who try to drive off after you have gone a centimeter past the car, or those that try to speed of in between people walking across
Cold
And should stay cold, so people are concerned about the climate change
I can't, it's physically impossible for a danish person to say consonants, we don't work like that
Say you
At least Danish sounds serious and not like it was made up by a child
I see you know what's up
And what we do have, is from public agent
You're right
Reindeer and caribou are the same animal
It's not US terminology, it's North America terminology
I support mandatory vaccinations with exceptions made for immun-compromised people and other similar cases where vaccinations are too dangerous
These cases should of course be determined by a doctor, not a Facebook group for concerned mothers
I think being anti-vaxx is being physically abusive with your children, and should be punished the same way
You don't have the right to not feed your kids until they starve just because you made them
You shouldn't have the right to withhold lifesaving medical care either
I don´t think as much about the vaccine question, but that a goverment has made it mandatory to get something injected into your body
I don´t like that
>You don't have the right to not feed your kids until they starve just because you made them
You shouldn't have the right to withhold lifesaving medical care either
That's actually a great way to explain it
Thanks
Like the incident with the HPV vaccine with a lot of people
> Fuck them all
Use a condom if you do
They should have to vaccinate their kids too
Your religion shouldn't give you the right to risk the life of a future independent adult with bodily autonomy
It's the same reason I support bans on genital mutilation for minors
They have a right to choose whether to undergo religious rituals when they are old enough to decide for themselves
No, only for diseases that are actually life threatening
The common flu today isn't life threatening except in exceptional circumstances
Punishing child abuse is extreme
That should also be out of the parents' hands
You made the choice to have a baby, you accept the responsibility of keeping it safe and healthy until it is 18
Doesn't matter what your religion says about the issue, if you ask me
> It’s also not a religion, it has all the attributes used to classify a cult
That's true of most religions
That would be those exceptional circumstances I mentioned
Also, they're adults
They can choose to get the flu shot or not
When we're talking mandatory vaccinations, we're really only talking about them being mandatory for kids
Adults are free to choose to expose themselves to danger
I don't know about other countries, but in Denmark they do not get to choose to refuse blood transfusion if the doctors think it can safe the child
Everything I can find on the topic says that people aged 65+ and those who are already suffering from other dangerous illnesses are the groups most likely to die from the flu
But you should definitely get your kids the flu shot if you're worried about it
It certainly can't hurt
But it isn't really a dangerous enough disease that I'm willing to put it under the "should be mandatory"-category, unless your child suffers from a chronic illness
We don't live in the middle ages, and the middle east is both a different culture and different religion
I'm no fan of religion, but it does provide value for a lot of people, and can be part of a functioning society as seen in many European countries
>The only difference is, they are big enough to scam people for money on the governmental level
In that we very much disagree
If you exercise the muscle, the soreness goes away faster
Of course, it's no fun exercising a sore muscle, so
pity-beer is also an option
I would not say this is a translation, but we had an energy company in Denmark called "Dong energy", I don't think I need to explain what that means ;)
I'm dehydrating after half an hour because of the heat
This warm for this long is not normal for so far north
we're not used to it
I'm working with an Egyptian, who told me that this is almost like fall in Egypt
He thinks its nice meanwhile I'm dying
I made the stupid decision to start firefighter training in the summer
I'm dying in this heat
Not really
It’s to hot here in Denmark
It really shouldn’t be this warm
A couple of days ago it was 29C, not good
It's miserable and I'm sticky
You shower and then five seconds later you're sticky again
Going to buy a floor fan when I get paid
Been drinking a lot of water
Nights are awful and I wake up i my own sweat
Send help
It’s been somewhat like this the past years
People still have their mind set that buying an AC is ridiculous
Bruv
I feel like the two girls in the tanning beds from Final Destination 3
I love it
The sun barely goes down and it's summertime, and the weather is fine
I'm literally dying
i had to lug some suitcases and travel by train, and i was literally dripping with sweat outdoors
(Aarhus-området)
you lucky bastard
today is pure agony too
that's like a month ago lmao
but yea, fuck this heat
i literally cant
When I was on vacation in Portugal it was a *very* dry heat though
It felt more like you were "roasting" but that's tolerable to me
The problem here in Denmark (and probably in Norway as well) is that the heat tends to come with humidity
So you don't feel the "roasting" on your skin as much, it feels more like you're suffocating on moist air, every part of your body is constantly sticky etc
Humidity also makes it harder for sweat to evaporate and actually cool you off
It's just running down your body in streams of nastiness
Just have to get used to it
Hey man dont worry about me, im just venting a little
> There has been a pretty strong independence/republican movement ever since the early 20th century
Lol, good luck with that
While I sympathise to a degree with the desire for self governance, the reality is that the Faroes have a pretty damn cushy setup, gaining economic and logistical support from a larger, more wealthy country, which happens to be both very culturally similar and not so large that it absolutely dominates Faroese culture
The idea that every local group and nation *must* have their own independent state is just plain silly
It is, for one, incredibly modern, but also not even evident in the modern world
I'd like to the see an independent Frisian state
Hell, the Catalans have a much more solid foundation, and even then, their prospects are sketchy at best
I'd be lying if I said it doesn't reek of a degree of ingratitude
Denmark gains very little from the financial support we provide the Faroes or even Greenland - it is a net economic drain - and yet, time and again, we effectively get spat on and pushed away
The Greenlanders are by far the worst here, but it's present both places
Them removing Danish as an official language, even though Greenland is part of Denmark and Danish is both the lingua franca and first language of 12% of Greenland's population, is laughably petty and frankly should not have been allowed
For both Greenland and the Faroes, independence is a silly and unfeasible idea, but that doesn't stop both countries from going on and on about it while continuing to enjoy the financial support from Denmark that they need to keep going
There is a great difference, in sheerly practical terms, between the economic feasibility of an independent Ireland (which is a large and fertile island, bigger than mainland Denmark), and that of the Faroes and Greenland
The former are a tiny collection of isles in the Atlantic, the latter incredibly cold and infertile and mostly uninhabitable
The only way Greenland, for instance, would be able to sustain its economy, is by massively doubling down on natural gas and oil, which is obviously not the way we want to head
Beyond that, I greatly object to any insinuation that Denmark's treatment of the Faroes and Greenland today are anywhere near as bad as Britain's towards Ireland
Even at our worst, we did not treat them *that* poorly, and today our greatest sins are if anything neglectance, not domination
We are propping them up, even at a detriment to ourselves, in large part because they quite simply need our money
The alternative is that they either massively lower their living standards, or fall into the pockets of China, Russia or the US, all of whom have their sights on the North Atlantic, and none of whom are likely to be as charitable as Denmark
I can think of several countries who would love to do so, to which I say: *rend og hop*
Close to one of which were nation states
Not since the German Stem duchies, which ceased being genuine tribal states by the end of the Dark Ages
Nearly all states in the Middle-ages and until the modern period were either the dominions of a city (which were often multiethnic) or the properties of nobles, whose possessions had no regard for ethnic lines
Even the exceptions are much more cases of "all the king's land happened to be inhabited by a single people" rather than "the people had their own state"
For continually giving them money while they respond by treating us like cruel imperialists
Sure
It's my tax-payer money that's going towards sustaining their economies for nothing in return - I feel like I (and many other Danes) am quite justified in finding it rather obnoxious
Why should we
They were transferred here at a time when Iceland was an integral part of the kingdom
That is not illegitimate
Much of the time, it wasn't even the Danes doing the transferring
Even the famous Codex Regius, which contains the Elder Edda, was *sent here freely* by an Icelandic bishop because he knew it would interest the King
Why on earth should we return what was given originally, unasked for, as a gift
Quite simple: What Denmark gets out of having the Faroes and Greenland is geopolitical influence
The North Atlantic is important and will only become more so in the coming decades
This is mostly in regards to Greenland, but by owning it, we have *significantly* more to say than if we were just a small nation at the edge of the Baltic
The problem is that so long as Greenland and the Faroes keep threatening independence, all of this is up in the air
How can we justify spending money on building up Arctic infrastructure in Greenland, if Greenland might just declare independence in a few years
Hell, if that happens, Greenland will inevitably fall under the influence of one of the superpowers, meaning that all our investments might fall into the hands of a rival
The solution is for Greenland and the Faroes to stop jabbering on about independence
Achieving it will not raise their living standards, it would jeperdise international security, and screw Denmark out of all the money we've spent
There's still a lot Denmark could and should do to help particularly Greenland, but cutting off the stream of money we're giving them won't solve that
Not unless they'd rather become clients of China, which is borderline treachery
Furthermore, the more they talk about independence, the less Denmark is willing to spend on long-term projects that might improve things
> Norwegian history book and see that
Which are obviously a far more impartial source than the Danish books
Funnily, Wikipedia concurs with the Danes on this subject, which is unsurprising, since the notion that Norway was a colony is absurd
Norway was a separate country, ruled by the same king
Denmark-Norway *had* colonies, such as the Gold Coast or the Virgin Isles
Greenland was a colony at one point
Norway has never been a colony, and to claim as much is rank revisionism
That aside, u/Huletroll said, nobody had ever claimed that it couldn't prosper on its own
Why on Earth would they
Everybody knows, and knew, that Norway was an independent kingdom in the past, besides which, as I said, Norway under Denmark *was its own country*, just not a sovereign one
It already prospered on its own, in so far as it was self-sufficient
Yet Norway is vastly bigger and more resource-rich than either the Faroes or Greenland, and comparing them is silly
A much nearer comparison would be to ask if Lofoten could "prosper" on its own
There is a substantial difference between items plundered by conquest, and the items gained by locals giving them uncompelled and unasked for
Why are they illegitimate
You say they were colonial, but Iceland was never a colony
Denmark treated Iceland poorly, but not as a colony
You trying to equate the situation with Britain and India is patently dishonest
And I repeat, why is it illigitimate for an Icelander to give an item to the Danes, and the Danes then to keep it
Had they been taken by coercion or plundered, you would have a case, but they were not
They weren't "gifts", they were gifts plain and simple
Officially they are 100% integrated
In practice, their governments are very devolved
It's an odd situation where, in principle, they have no autonomy whatsoever, whereas in reality, they are more independent than, say, Scotland in the UK
There is no mention of an independent Greenland or Faroes in the Danish constitution
People speak of *Rigsfællesskabet*, "The unity of the Realm", and act as if there exists a Realm of Denmark which includes Greenland, the Faroe Islands and Denmark proper
In reality, there is no "Denmark" separate from "The Kingdom of Denmark", and Greenland and the Faroes are an integral part of the country
Unlike the UK or the Netherlands, Denmark's possessions are not *legally* their own countries, although they are treated as such
So in theory, we could revoke their devolved governments without breaching the constitution in any way
That would obviously cause an outcry, although I do think the rope has been lengthened a bit too much
The Greenlandic government, for one, is essentially run by the hyper-nationalist urban elite of Nuuk, whose views do not, from what I've heard, represent the broader population
*Most* Greenlanders outside of Nuuk are more pragmatic about the union with Denmark, but because the extremist factions in the capital have all the influence, that is the direction the country is being pushed
This is part of my issue with the whole thing - in practice, they control *everything* except foreign policy
So we fund their economies and provide them with defense, while gaining nothing save the geopolitical influence
It really is an incredibly favourable deal to them, yet they act as we are somehow impeding them
When I let google auto-finish, I get:
"Danskere er født med en bajer i hånden"
Meaning: "Danes are born with a beer in their hand"
I guess to the other Nordic countries, the danish are probably born with a silver spoon in their throat
My dad usually told me that my parents bought me in IKEA/Bilka/JYSK, and that they unfortunately couldn't return me
Privileged kids are born with a silver spoon in the ass
Danes are born with a beer in their hand
Danes are born with a silver spoon up the ass
According to google
Very true
Yeah I was about to write "En Tuborg og kanelsnegl" = "A beer and a pastry"
Hey man, if you're smiling, I'm smiling :D
Hmm, idk
In denmark (small country) we have our flags freaking everywhere, we don't sing our national anthem every morning (we arent nationalists
Randers is a good example in Denmark
It has its defendants, but generally it is the joke of the whole nation
For some reason it has gotten the reputation of being full of scooter/moped riding wannabe gangster teenagers who's worst sin is staying out pass their parents' curfews
In the US, public transport is mostly for the poor, from what I know
Poor people in the US tend to have lower education, less access to mental health care, and there is also more homelessness in general
All of these, I think, contribute to a higher tendency of mental breakdowns, resulting in these episodes
Also drugs
Rampant drug abuse seem to be a much bigger problem in many US cities than it does here in Denmark at least
That's my completely unresearched, gut-feeling 2 cents, anyway
People get better treatment for mental health issues
They don't end up acting crazy on the streets because they get the help they need
But it's muh freedom, you can't expect a doctor to help you if you are in need
Tax are stealing
Good thing we 'Muricans are the 100$% freest so we can choose to go bankrupt for calling the ambulance

Paragraf 1
>Denne grundlov gælder for alle dele af Danmarks Rige
This constitution holds for all parts of the Danish realm
&#x200B;
Seems sorta self explanatory, but its not the weirdest line that's sorta meaningless in a modern context
The next parts are about how the King (i know we have a queen but the constitution says its a king) inherits and when he becomes of age
And then it goes on about the lutheran church
PART I
This Constitutional Act shall apply to all parts of the Kingdom of Denmark
The form of government shall be that of a constitutional monarchy
Royal authority shall be inherited by men and women in accordance with the provisions of the Act of Succession to the Throne of March 27, 1953
Legislative authority shall be vested in the King and the Folketing conjointly
Executive authority shall be vested in the King
Judicial authority shall be vested in the courts of justice
The Evangelical Lutheran Church shall be the Established Church of Denmark, and as such shall be supported by the State
(Folketing is the Danish name for our parliament)
>§1
>This constitutional law is valid for all parts of the Kingdom of Denmark
..well, that was boring
Extra Bonus: "Jydske Lov" from 1241 is a precursor to the constitution begins as follows:
>[The] Country is to be build by law, but if everyone were to accept with his own and let others enjoy the same right, then no law would be needed
No law is as good as the truth, but where one is in doubt about the truth, then the law shall show the truth
The Preamble to the most famous of our (many) constitutions is quite verbose:
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
>By law, land must be built, but if anyone would settle for his own and let others enjoy the same right, then no law was needed
But no law is as good to follow as the truth, but where there is doubt as to what is truth, the law must show the truth
>If there was no law in the country, he had the most who could take the most
Therefore, the law must be made in the best interests of all, that the righteous and peaceable and lawless can enjoy their peace, and the unjust and evil can be fearful from what is written in the law, and therefore dare not execute the evil which they have in mind
It is also true, that when someone cannot be lured to do good for fear of God and love for justice, then the fear of government and law of the land can prevent them from doing evil and punish them if they do
>The law must benefit honor and justice, it must be tolerable, according to the custom of the land, appropriate and useful and clear, so that everyone can know and understand what the law says
The law is not to be made or written for the special benefit of any man, but according to all their best interests, who live in the land
No man shall judge against the law which the king gives, and the land has adopted, but according to that law the land must be judged and governed
Nor can the law passed by the king and adopted by the land be amended or repealed without the will of the land unless it is manifestly contrary to the word of God
>It is the task of the king and the countrys earls to watch judgments and to do justice and to save those who are being wronged, such as widows and helpless children, pilgrims and foreigners and the poor - those who are most often wronged, and to not let evil people who do not want to improve live in his land
For the King punishes and kills the wicked, he is the servant of God and the guardian of the land
For just as the Holy Church is ruled by the Pope and Bishop, so every land must be ruled and guarded by the King or his officials
Therefore, all who live in his land owes him fealty and are bound to serve him, and in return he is bound to give them peace
All worldly rulers must also know that with the power God gave them in this world, he also assigned them to guard his holy church against all demands
But if they are forgetful or unjust and ignores the law then on Judgment Day, they must be held accountable, if the freedom of the Church and the peace of the land is diminished in their time
>Everyone who sees this book must know that King Valdemar, the second son of Valdemar, the son of Saint Knud, when he had been king for thirty-nine winters, and a thousand and two hundred and forty winters after our Lord was born, in the following month of March, wrote this book and gave this law, which is written here in Danish, in Vordingborg with the consent of his sons who were present , King Erik , Earl Abel and Count Christoffer, as well as Uffe, who is Archbishop in Lund, and Bishop Niels in Roskilde, Bishop Iver in Funen, Bishop Peder in Aarhus, Bishop Gunner in Ribe, Bishop Gunner in Viborg, Bishop Jens in Vensyssel and Bishop Jens in Hedeby and also with the consent of all the great men who are in his kingdom
This Constitution Act shall apply to all parts of the Kingdom of Denmark
The form of government shall be that of a constitutional monarchy
The Royal Power shall be inherited by men and women in accordance with the provisions of the Succession to the Throne Act, 27th March, 1953
The legislative power shall be vested in the King and the Folketing conjointly
The executive power shall be vested in the King
The judicial power shall be vested in the courts of justice
The Evangelical Lutheran Church shall be the Established Church of Denmark, and) as such, it shall be supported by the State
There is A LOT about the King and the Folketing, and administration, legislation and structure of the courts before it gets to the rights of the people (part VIII)
It is actually kind of important to specify that it also applies for Greenland or the Faroes (and Iceland, at the time of writing I guess)
The constitution was implemented on the Faroe Islands (1850) and Greenland (1953), before they got home rule
The acts granting self-governing status are legally "normal" Danish laws within the constitutional framework
It doesn't specify it applies for Greenland and the Faroe Islands
It specifies it applies to the entire Danish state
After 1953 Denmark no longer had any external territories as Greenland with the implementation of the constitution was incorporated into Denmark (some one hundred years later than the Faroe Islands)
Iceland declined to implement the constitution
Section 01 applies to Denmark proper, Greenland and the Faroe Islands
It's not specified
It was added as late as 1953, when Greenland was incorporated, and not when the Faroe Islands were incorporated in 1850
It's is also a thing in r/denmark "det er fredag mine gutter" followed by a picture of Kaj from Kaj og Andrea
We have the same thing on r/dankmark
But instead of wednesday it's friday and instead of any frog it's the main character from an old kids tv show (maybe not that old, I'm 17 and saw it a lot when I was <4 years old), know as Kaj
We even have a special kind of cake, which is sold in most bakeries around the country known as "kajkager", or kajcakes
He is one of the mascots of r/dankmark
Denmark has it on fridays as well
Same in Denmark
Which frog do you guys use
Are you implying that the wider europe isn't familiar with danish childrens shows
To expand on this: Every Friday u/CalmYourDrosophila posts a drawing of a human-like [Kaj] The image is filled with clues that references what has been hot(ish) topics on r/Denmark during the week

Wasn’t in Europe but Vietnam
We were in a hotel packed with chinese turists, my brother’s girlfriend picks the last butter from the breakfast buffet - as she continues to scout the buffet, a chinese bloke comes up, takes the butter from her plate and leaves
Obviously not
[This picture] of Queen Margrethe II
She’s got a cigarette, a juice box and some bread
Perfectly sums up the Danish mentality of [the Law of Jante] which is an integral part of Danish culture
Just because Margrethe is the queen, it doesn’t mean she can’t smoke whilst drinking a juice box and eat some bread
[She's got a love for hotdogs as well]
the law of jante basically just means, don't think you are better than anyone else because you are not
To be honest, I'm not sure what it is
Could be some Swedish abomination
I feel sorry for the Copenhagen area, because they are so close to Sweden
Truly a tragedy
We have what we call the rotten banana which is the west coast of Jutland
It's a lovely place to go on holidat but by now there's not much else left
All companies left, farming declined and cities are increasingly being depopulated
Also the island called Lolland (yes lol-land) is know to be the place the society outcasts go to live because of extremely low housing prices and fairly boring nature
Western Jutland
For specifically the kids and families that have to deal with indre-missionske
And since western Jutland is known as the most religious part of Denmark, I’m sure they also have most of the inner missions, which my mom says are our “religious conservatives”
And as a person who has been really really religiously conservative in the past, I kinda get why it can be frustrating for kids
Although I’ve never officially been a part of the moment of inner mission
Thanks
Lol
I answered Copenhagen because they're so close to Sweden
I guess that whole region is shit
finally someone agrees
Western Jutland is only second place for me
Lolland is worse
They dont have the attraction of the North Sea, and with all the unemployment and people moving away it is hard to see what they have got going for them
Agree with Lolland, the Island is seen as the worst part of denmark, but hey, atleast lalandia is there
I’m not an expert on lolland
I sometimes forget about it so I’m unfortunately not knowledgeable about it enough to include them
But thanks for reminding me about their hardships (:
What is a “major” event in your country, that no one from other countries seem to know of
In Denmark, a land slide election is not a general term for a big change or a large victory at an election
There is only one: THE land slide election of 1973
The second biggest party after that election, second only to the socialdemocrats, was Fremskridtspartiet, which among other things ran on cutting all taxes to 0% and abolishing the military
Their defense policy was in all seriousness to abolish the military and replace it with a voice mail saying "we surrender" in Russian, German and English
The war of 1864
Denmark lost two fifth of its territory to Prussia in a devastating war, with the bloodiest battle in Danish history being the one fought at Dybbøl during the war
It was a major defeat and ushered in a period where the Danes really formed this identity of being a small European country, never again to rule the waves as we once did
To everyone else it's that funny little war that Bismarck used as practice for the wars that would lead to the formation of the German Reich
That Denmark had a upper house in our parliament; [Landstinget] originally, membership and the electorate was restricted, the bicameral system was abolished in favor of unicameralism
Wait, what
>The Schleswig-Holstein question is so complicated, only three men in Europe have ever understood it
One was Prince Albert, who is dead
The second was a German professor who became mad
I am the third and I have forgotten all about it
>Lord Palmerston
Though the consequences of the Battle of Dybbøl can NOT be underestimated, it isn't the bloodiest battle in Danish history
That would go to the Battle at Lund in 1676
I believe that's the conservative number - we apparently have a lot more peace settlements than 13, indicating that we've had more wars
judging from the Danish history of war Swedish and German should be the only two
I think you might wanna look up who Olof Palme is my friend ;) Otherwise yes, you're right
Yes, it's simply called 1864 as far as I know
Much of it was actually filmed in Czechia :)
Very accurate vice versa as well
Next to a statue of Charles, as I understand it
Hardly an endorsement of either one, when you're placing top diametrically opposed men beside each other
In your culture, what feels illegal even though it technically isn’t?
Denmark has a long tradition for “Friday candy” (fredagsslik)
Basically, in many homes with children, you’re only allowed to eat candy on Fridays, and then you often make it a binge with a BIG bowl in front of the TV
A nice little tradition
I never had this rule as a kid, but it still feels
*wrong* to buy a bag of candy on a Tuesday night
Walking into a supermarket with a bag from another supermarket D:
Not after the recent price hike on plastic shopping bags
(now we pay ~$0
70 for a bag, and *everyone* brings their own bag - just like the law intended us to do
I'm about to do that right now
they had a great value price for salmon in føtex, but all the other great offers are at netto
If I end up paying the same for a glass of water as a glass of coke, then I'd want something for my money
Restaurants, cafes and bars are allowed to charge for tap water and do it ...
Wow a whole facility for wallstreet bets members
It always seemed weird to me how France is such a cheese country yet you don’t have cheese slicers from what I’ve seen
> Drinking wine in anything that isn't a wine glass
No one around me really cares, but I always have an hesitation moment before pouring
Wait, what
To me it seems the more rural you go in France, the more casual people are with their wine
I mean, sure you'll get a wine glass in a restaurant, but for getting a glass with a friend on a sunny afternoon
Any glass is fine
And as a woman, thank fuck for that lol
I don't even understand this system, you know nothing about the person, based on what do you say yes or no
Just if the person is hot or not
I know it sounds weird but the cat lover in me wish we had stray cats : ( Or at least the amount of them I saw in Greece
gasp
haha alright sounds good
Please, as a student, I did that _before_ it was popular, and to top it off, I would use the bag as a garbage bag after it got too used to be able to carry groceries
I wish you luck
I also feel like a lot of people see Scandinavian countries as perfect angels free of sin (past and present) so when we do anything wrong we get so much hate
Not that many of us don’t simp for our great reputation though
I’m fearing a US like worship of the country and it’s ways
thank you, needed that, better log of Reddit and go then
Unironically I'd love to have your water culture here
I love ice
Ice cubes feels like the biggest luxury
I was once at someone's house and they had an ice cube maker and water dispenser build into the fridge, American style, and I nearly fainted
> My guilt is proportionate with the quality of the wine let's say
I agree with you there, then
Most wine I've drunk off regular kitchenware was bought by the liter in those bring-your-own-jug wine shops
also, sun, cheese, and bread makes any wine taste good
and now I want to go on vacation somewhere warm
Yes it is
But since I have started using reusable bags, I now have to buy rolls of garbage bags
Haha, my mom and her husband has a fridge like that
Det er sgu fedt der altid er isvand og/eller isterninger klar
Denmark so angelic perfect, monks at Lindisfarne simply died from awe when they saw us
Ahem
They definitely aren’t.
When people have ice cubes, they fill a special ice cube tray or bag with water and freeze it in the freezer
But outside of restaurants (and even then it’s not guaranteed), I have ice cubes like
a couple of times a year maybe
In Danish, you can say slik, snolder or godter, although the last one is rarely used anymore
It is used around Christmas as "julegodter" = Christmas candy / cookies
None of the words are related to genitals
Also, when Norwegians say "knask eller knep" it sounds a bit dirty to Danes, because "knep" is Danish slang for "fuck".
Damn, Norwegians are much more kinky than I thought
It reminds me of a time when I was visiting my company's office in Oslo for a few days, and I asked if anyone wanted some "morgenbrød" the next day, because then I would bring some
Not exactly “no other languages”, but rare enough:
- Gender neutral and uncomplicated (no extra meaning like “friend”) word for boyfriend/girlfriend
- Most different vowel sounds of any language, one study said
Hard to measure but it has to be up there
- No articles like the/el/la/die
The word gets another ending instead
A horse, the horse, multiple horses, all the horses - en hest, hesten, flere heste, alle hestene
- Completely random choice of gender
We have neutral and common gender
There’s not even an arbitrary rule where you can say “oh most animals are x and fruits are y”
- The soft d. Insert dick joke here
The other way around; Danish has no word for "please". We have ways to sound polite (we just don't use them much) but no single word or phrase, that are always used
The way we say numbers out loud
First of all we say the numbers "reversed". In English 32 would be thirtytwo
In Danish 32 would be two-and-thirty
The way we say 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90
Example: 60 is in Danish would be tres, which translates to "three's". It originates from tresindstyve, which means "three-times-twenty". Makes sense, 60 is 3×20
80 would be firs (from firsindstyve)
"fours" or "four-times-twenty".
But it gets more complicated
50 is halvtres or halvtresindstyvene, meaning "half-three-times-twenty", which doesn't really make sense
70 is halvfjerds or halvfjerdsindstyve, meaning "half-four-times-twenty"
90 is halvfems or halvfemsindstyve meaning "half-five-times-twenty"
77 would be syvoghalvfjerds(-indstyvene) = "seven-and-half-fours(-times-twenty)"
A bit confusing
Hygge, it can’t be translated directly but it means something along the lines of having a good time
The simple answer for Danish without doing any research on complex grammar in my language, would probably be the word "hygge" which I am obligated to feel proud of
It's the cozy feeling you get when being in good company
However, if you've enjoyed hanging out with someone, it could be called "hygge". So it's just a positive in general
How cool
We got that too in Danish
More common with people who have stronger dialects, especially around the island of Fyn and some parts of Jylland
Same in Danish
"Kraftædeme" is a Danish swear word meaning "cancer-eat-me".
You forgot _stød_ which most dialects have but is pretty Danish
It's a kind of throaty effect on some words as it's phonemic in speech: _billigst_ (cheapest) vs _billist_ (car user) only really differ because of _stød_ as the G is silent
Also we do that weird thing with the letter D. Actually pretty much any of B, D, G do strange sounds after vowels
That must translate to the Danish word "hygge".
"Hygge" means all the things you listed above
Does it cover small words also, like prepositions and pronouns
Could you say "Me and my dog are going to the park for a walk" in swearwords
Same goes for "Trøndersk", which are dialects found in West and Southern Jylland in Denmark and in the Trøndelag region in Norway
Example from a Southern-jutish dialect in Denmark
" A e u o æ ø i æ å, e a." which means  "I am out on the island in the river, am I".
> Ich gehe mal zur Schule
A Chinese friend who doesn't speak German once explained to me how they use the phrase 一下 to soften their sentences: "It literally means 'one time' but we use it to make sentences more natural; it's very hard for non-Chinese to know when to use it
" And I was like "Oh yeah, like '(ein)mal' in German, got ya
IIRC halvtresindstyvene is supposed to mean 2
5\*20 = 50
"Half three" is 2
You can say opholdsvejr in Danish too
You do of course realize people from Sjælland have an equally strong dialect to the rest of us, right
Yes, you don’t think of it as a system
You just remember 50-90 like you remember any other words
And it’s really cute too
Kæreste, meaning “dearest”. A couple is *kærester*, dearests
I get that it’s not exactly *only* in my language
Kæreste means “dearest” in Danish
In Spanish there are at least some general guidelines, same with German, where we learned that most fruits were female for instance
Kæreste, meaning “dearest”. Æ is like the sound you make when you go “ehh
”. Kæ-ruh-stuh
When someone is a couple, they’re kærester, dearests
True
We are always awkward about that
Eller "Jeg vil gerne bede om rødgrød" eller "Vil du være venlig at give mig rødgrød", men der er ikke én vending eller ét ord, der dækker please
I understand, but I just don't get how 2
5 would be half three
In Danish it would be 'skadefryd', but a lot of our words come from German
My little sister Tilde has been Tildchen since I learned German in school
I do, I think you misread my sentence
The inhaling "yes" is (in my experience) more common in dialects from Fyn and some parts of Jylland
Yeah, it can be used for anything, really
You can use it to describe people, describe the mood around you, describe your new lovely lamp
Yes, a wallpaper could be "hyggelig", but not anything can be "hyggelig".
Most of the time "hygge" means a somewhat cozy atmosphere
Sometimes it just means nice (example: det var en hyggelig dag = it was a nice day), but most of the time it means cozy
Music is a great example, "hyggelig" music isn't just any good music
"Hygge" music has to be happy and not too loud to be "hygge".
A "hyggeligt" wallpaper isn't just any pretty wallpaper
It has to create a cozy (cozy isn't the most accurate word, but it's the closest English word) atmosphere in the room to be "hygge".
It's difficult to explain
Not really
In the year 200 or so, Norwegians from Trøndelag attacked and settled in the area of West-Jutland and Southern-Jutland, and those dialects today are called Sønderjysk and Vestjysk
Keep in mind that over many years, Sønderjysk have had a stronger germanic influence, whereas Vestjysk kept closer ties to West norse
The only thing they have in common with Trøndersk is the vowel sentences
A better translation for halvtresindtyvene would actually be "half-thrice-times-twenty". That means a "half" away from thrice, which would be (3-0
5)\*20 = 50
No I got that, I was simply responding to your "stronger dialects" part, as for me it seemed like an odd word choice, no offense meant of course, it's just a common thing I meet as someone from Jylland living in Copenhagen
Loads of people from here seem to think that strong accents are somehow a "fyn og jylland"-thing
Almost all Danes have strong accents
For example, to me, people from Copenhagen or Nordsjælland have a very strong accent that I find hard to not take note off whenever I hear them speak, whereas people from say, Aarhus or Esbjerg don't (and Im not from either of those places, btw)
Ahh, that makes much more sense
Agree now that I look at it
As someone who's grown up with parents from both Jylland and Sjælland I don't really have a dialect, in Jylland they think I'm from Sjælland and opposite applies to when I'm in Sjælland
I personally think people who have the strongest dialects (really quick to put a finger on) are Copenhageners, North-jutes, people from around central Sjælland, like Næstved, Bornholmers
It's sometimes difficult to hear Sønderjysk apart from Vestjysk if you are not from the area
Næstved is certainly one I always stumble over whenever I hear it
I think with Sønder and Vestjysk, much of the reason why their dialects can seem stronger is that they are in a way speaking a sub-language to Danish when they speak Sønderjysk or Thybomål. The same could be said about Bornholmsk or even my Østjysk at times, where we also have words that you don't say either outside or area or Jylland in general
But say, for example, a person born-and-bred in central Copenhagen to me has an equally strong and at times hard-to-understand dialect (to be fair, I've lived here 7 years now, so I do understand people by now)
Think Kim Larsen or Erik Clausen for example or the examples this [language expert talks about]
I'm pretty sure that for science reasons it has to be winter time, but I'd prefer summer time because it means that I can bike home from school or work without having to bring my lights all the time
Bro think about us northerners
And what should Denmark use
Longest living or the first known domestic cat
The way you phrase the second one makes it sound like Brussels airport is the biggest airport that sells chocolate, as in there are larger airports in the world but none of them sell chocolate
Personally i'd like city's or towns that aren't country capitals like, München, Bergen, ~~Edinburgh,~~ Marseille, Salzburg, Gibraltar, Florence etc
or a border area like Malmö-Copenhagen
I think a The troubles setup with Dublin and Belfast as twin cities would also be interesting

The National Aquarium of Denmark, also known as The Blue Planet
Absolutely ludicrously overpriced, mediocre food/drinks in their restaurant/cafés, and overall bland collection of sea life

I’d know since I’ve been working there for the last 1
5 years
I went to Lapland once as a prize from a Game of Thrones competition
The trip was amazing - sleeping in an ice hotel, riding snow scooters etc
- but when I found out what these activities would've actually cost me if I had to pay myself, I would never have gone there
So expensive
First time I was in Barcelona (in '97, I think) I saw a guy casually picking lifting the purse off a scantily clad tourist's shoulder, and run off
He got maybe 10 meters before he was side tacked by an equally scantily clad girl, and he had barely hit the ground before an anonymous old panel van rolled up, and two uniformed cops jumped out, cuffed the guy, and threw(!) him in the back
The cops jumped in and drove off again, and the tackling girl handed the purse back to the victim, adjusted her sunglasses, and strolled off in the other direction
The whole thing lasted less than 20 seconds, and practically no one noticed
The victim didn't even have time to raise her voice before the guy was eating pavement
I was very impressed by the effectiveness of the Spanish police that day
I was less impressed by the effectiveness of the company I was there to consult for, but that's another - far nerdier - story
Who in their right mind would even use a taxi in Prague
The city has some fine public transport for reasonable prices
You can always spot the locals as people sitting along the harbour with cans they bought from the kiosk down one of the side streets for a fraction of what they cost at the restaurant 10 metres away
Nyhavn has the nicest public toilets
Well worth the 2kr fee to use them
Vilnius is close to the top on my to go list
But a big fucking unit, if I ever knew one
The toilets by the boats, near Kgs

Best Italian restaurants I have been to, has been 6 table restaurant down a tiny alley in Florence, and a restaurant in an industrial zone out of Bergamo
Both places had people in white shirts and ties coming in for their lunch
Yeah, they're up by the anchor monument
You go down a flight of stairs, and then you enter a pretty cool space with dark wooden doors, brass fittings, and nice tiles
I was definitely not expecting that the first time I went down there
Ah, found a picture:

Other than coffee, I don't really fit the Danish stereotypes either
I guess I get pretty Danish when I'm drunk, but that's more of a definitional thing
Sounds horrible
Couldn't they see we were just minding our own damn business
Ironic looking at the ideological developments in Poland
The entire film series [The Prince and Me]
They start by getting basically everything wrong about our royal house (we don't have a king, we have a queen
Also, it's a big issue that she's a commoner in the movies despite both our princes having married 'commoners' without any sort of backlash or issue from anybody or anything
Just to name a few)
They mess up all the Danish names, they mess up the cities, all the costumes, and the entire language
Basically, they just make up everything and then claim it's "Danish".
Also, quite hilariously, they have a "Norwegian princess" in movie two, who wants to marry the prince because her country is poor
Norway is apparently poor according to them
I can't really give you an example of one film that portrays Denmark in a cringy way, but usually whenever Denmark is mentioned in a film or TV-series, it's something about HYGGE (pronounced "HOO-GA" if they're English speaking), the Danish welfare, something-something "socialism" something or the Danes being the happiest people on earth
It's obviously very one-dimensional, and it becomes a bit tedious when you've seen these portrayals a million times
Hahaha I saw that as a child
Quite liked it since Denmark is rarely in foreign movies
I wonder how I would feel about it now
Username checks out for this
Username checks out
I think a classical example is when a scene is supposedly taking place in Denmark, they often are filming in another country because the actual Danish terrain is too boring or does not fit their idea of Denmark
An example could be at the end of "The Danish Girl" they used a shot of a fjord in Norway for Vejle fjord
Also in Vikings, at some point they are in Hedeby which apparently according to them lies in a frozen tundra
I’ve seen the “Danish (scandi) people like to be naked all the time” stereotype too, and it’s kinda dumb imo
Being topless at the beach in summer when you’re trying to get a tan =/= naked 24/7
I also find that people in the Nordic’s are often portrayed as being kinda distant from western (American) society, as if people here don’t know anything about America at all, and have never seen any kind of technology before
It’s just
odd
The fact that he's called Edward really gives it away that they probably just wanted to make a movie about the Brits, but went with Danes because it seemed a more "likely" scenario
Wait until you see the one where they go to [South East
Asia]
They also did it with a bit of cheek - whereas The Prince and Me takes itself about as seriously as a romcom can
The prince and me
It is also discussed in this thread
I heard some guys (Danish) on the bus once, chatting to a couple of girls about how the people of Skåne (Scania, southern most province in Sweden), secretely want to be Danish again, and that every year on some date, the people of Skåne collect buckets of land in a symbolic attempt to return said land to the Danes
The girls these guys were chatting up were Swedish
I write "α". My handwriting looks like the one of a 5-year-old, so it would look completely ridiculous if I tried to go refined by writing "a".
I've actually encountered it a lot
Usually only with women/girls, though
I would write æ a bit like this in handwriting: œ.
Imagine writing an o and then making a c in the middle
[kind of ugly] since I wrote it larger than usual
Capital Æ is mostly written like it looks on a PC
It's kind of awkward to do and I don't think I've ever seen it written prettily
Your handwriting is really strange
Is this how you were taught to write or just what it became over time
Do people from your country joke about reconquering a part of another
In Denmark, we joke about reconquering the Swedish counties of Skåne, Halland and Blekinge (mostly Skåne, as it is the closest to our mainland)
Yea, gib england and norway back please, North Sea Empire Stronk
Dude, don't even mention that to the Swedes
Before you know it they've given it back, and then we're stuck with Malmø on our side of the border
\*shudders*
I guees Germany will have a hard time relating to this
We also joke that Denmark should go to the river Eider in Germany again
Between 811 and 1864 it was our border to Germany
DANMARK TIL EJDER
I mean, no of course not
We're way too mature for that stuff

Well firstly, I never said it was a war only that we owed you for it
Secondly, you guys didn't even bother to declare war on us, so you're right it wasn't even a war
It was a cowardly suckerpunch
genuinely had no idea there was anything going on in Belarus, much less a protest or anything of the sort
The way you treat religion, in Denmark Religion is a private affiar, with a large majority being part of the state church so i guess there is very little religious debate, or discussion here
With the Atheists being the second most popular "Relgious affiliation" (yes i know Atheists take issue with that designation, but theres not really a good word for it besides that)
We also have significant overlap with Atheists, and Christians, with many being both
America is very preachy and adversarial, in regards to religion, all the Atheists i have met from the States are very anti church, to the point of being almost hatefull which i just don't get
Guns and Gun laws
Why
The contradictory opposition towards nudity, like, y'all have sex scenes in every fucking tv show, film and whatnot, but a toddler being naked, or just nudity in general, god forbid that
The lack of unions, like, no wonder your minimum wage hasn't gone up with inflation
Drinking laws
As a dane I am a little offended
That they wave a battle flag that stood for keeping slavery
It would be like if Germans had Swastika flying flags
I will never forget the time i ordered a ‘medium’ soda and it was like 0,8 L
One thing is having a flag outside, but you will occasionally see a video from an American classroom, and you'll *know* it's an American classroom because there's three separate flags in that *one room*.
Every country has kind people, just as every country has rude people
Americans aren't especially kind or rude, you guys just happen to be explicit with your emotions in public than many European countries deem appropriate
Also, your restaurant industries have been build so severs are relying on costumers' good-will in order to be able to make enough money to pay rent / eat the next day
This means you've cultivated a culture where the servers are overly friendly and enthusiastic
You are kidding yourself if you think they are like this because they are kind
It's fake, and that annoys Europeans who aren't used to it
There are many people that say they are Christian, and Atheists at the same time
Being members of the church, but not beliveing in god
I second this
Unions isn't politics, pff, it's the reason i earn a living wage
Sorry about that
It's just happens to be the most confusing part of Your lovely nation
its cheap and fast
The thing was bigger than any cup of soda I’ve seen here until recently
Just googled it
Burger king medium soda is 0,89 L.
McDonald’s is 0,62 L.
Wendy’s is 0,95 L.
The issue Only The lack thereof
Burger king large is 0,95L
McDonalds large 0,95L
Wendy’s 1,24 L
Just one thing slightly tangential
When \[insert Nordic country\] ranks as *Happiest Country in the World*, what it really means is *On Average Most Free From Material Worries* or something to that tune, not that we are giddy with joy and high on life, which Odin knows we ain't. Especially the British press had a bad habit of taking it a bit too literally
I am a Dane and I have lived and worked in a fair few countries
One of the things that Danes (and Scandinavians) probably don't realise, is how good their countries actually are
But if there is one thing we Danes have to deal with, it is having the most unpronounceable language in the world
Even the Norwegians and Swedes can agree on this
Things that personally bothers me:
- Postal service fucking sucks
I was shocked when I found out a lot of Europe has one day delivery for a lot of things
Here, it’ll take around a week if it’s from Denmark, around a month or very often more if it’s from outside of Denmark
“Sorry, we don’t ship to Denmark” is quite common
- Things such as food and clothes are expensive
For example, we don’t have a restaurant culture because it’s just too expensive
Most people don’t go out to eat more than once a month
Things like “bad” weather, apparently hard to make friends (have not lived anywhere else to compare), apparent “conformity-culture” (I live in a big city, whereas most of Scandinavia is very rural, I think this might play a role), not having any truly big cities with the biggest one being around 1-2 million - I’ve heard these from others but they don’t really bother me personally
Guess it’s a matter of taste
And also, something people in these threads never seem to talk about
of course it’s very difficult to be an immigrant anywhere
It’ll be hard having to deal with locals already having established social groups, learning the language, figuring out the bureaucracy, and so on and so forth
In Scandinavia as well
I can't think of anything only Scandinavians have to deal with
But I'm of course from Denmark and not Sweden
Maybe that people expect us to be perfect somehow
But we are just people trying to make it work without to many emotions ruining it
One thing I say about Denmark and probably Scandinavia in general: if you fit in the Scandinavian homogeneity, you'll love it
But if you don't, you might socially and culturally find it not as good as you hoped for
Very late to the party, and I don't think I've seen this mentioned, but as much as Scandinavia is touted as the most feminist area of the world, it's a bit of a problem since people take that to mean that there is no need to do better
In my experience as a Danish woman who happens to be not-entirely-white, Danish feminism has a loooooooong way to go as far as intersectionality is concerned
Even though my family background is as middle class as they come, due to health issues that have affected my ability to complete a uni degree and subsequently find work, I am also part of the financial underclass that mainstream feminists tend to ignore
Sure, we have a Queen and a female PM, as well as decent legislation surrounding parental leave and gendered discriminiation, but there are still so many instances of "everyday sexism" that refuse to die
A lot of the sexist tropes are perpetuated by women, too
Additionally, feminism is still a dirty word in Denmark as it's been cherry-picked and warped to be either an extreme form of misandry or an excuse for some women to make sexism work for them, instead of trying to eliminate the sexist frameworks in the first place
So yeah, being "the most feminist countries in the world" while still being sexist as hell is a pretty unique problem, I'd say
Denmark has been one of the happiest countries, but also one of the biggest consumers of antidepressants
IMO we're more like "The most contented country in the world
Is everything flowers and lollipops
Is everything pretty OK
Yea
I sleep very deeply, and I find it much easier to wake up in the morning when light comes in
Never sleep with my blinds down
It's funny, Norwegians go to Sweden, Swedes go to Denmark, Danes go to Germany, and Germans go to Poland, all in the pursuit of cheaper alcohol
I think it depends on the patient
In case of both my mother and my brother and other people I know how have suffered from cancer, treatment started immediately after they were diagnosed
Other stuff like hip-replacements can take a while
I mean I know we danes talk shit about you but I mean, we're ruddy neighbors eh
Although there are politics that we disagree on, i thinks Sweden is quite a nice country
Oh we can find you alright
One of the joys of being Scandinavian is feeling like kind of a rich person pretty much everywhere you go, even Japan, which reddit told me was shockingly expensive
In Japan you can get a decent meal for what gets you a hot dog at a gas station here
The thought that Scandinavians are shy is a misconception, we’re very private people who like to mind our own business
We’re tough to get to know, and that is a real struggle for many visitors and immigrants; but we make great friends if you make it through the barrier
Tf is Walpurgis night
We call it Sankthans in Denmark and it’s in June
We just make a cardboard witch and burn her at a giant bonfire, so she can fly (that’s the justification)
This just in, scandinavia still sexist as hell
>Additionally, feminism is still a dirty word in Denmark as it's been cherry-picked and warped to be either an extreme form of misandry or an excuse for some women to make sexism work for them, instead of trying to eliminate the sexist frameworks in the first place
There was a Guardian article recently where Denmark came out as the least feminist nation in the world because it had the least self-identifying feminists
Saudi Arabia taking the number 1 spot should probably have put the methodology into question maybe, but it does reveal this curious thing that even "progressive" women into women's rights don't care for the feminism label, and it weirds me out when my girlfriend (very left wing etc) rejects being called a feminist but clearly the word just has some baggage here that it doesn't have in many other countries, and it doesn't automatically translate to rejecting the ideas and struggles typically associated with feminism worldwide
Yup, there are places in Denmark where they don't see snow at all some years, and if they do, it'll most likely melt when it touches down
Relentlessly so
Found it
I think it is when the swedes put up their majsstang
It is near sankt hans
Denmark had border controls to Sweden even prior to the corona crisis in Sweden because of the crime wave of explosions and shootings in Sweden
Some Swedish criminals also exploded two bombs in Copenhagen
Yes
Grenades easier to get than fire arms
So the organized crime gangs use these instead
These gangs are mostly immigrants fighting for territories for the drugs an extortion
That’s why we call Malmö the Nordic Chicago
>I can imagine Copenhagen being better
People enjoy [Reffen] a lot or [Torvehallerne] Hija de Sanchez was actually "Best street food in Europe" in 2018
It's unlikely that heath care staff in Denmark don't speak English
They would minimum have had English in school
Perhaps your friends in Sweden met someone who for the first time had to use English at work and maybe was shy or something
>I believe only denmark has higher with 60%.
Denmark has a tax ceiling of 52%. The top bracket starts at 48,000 Danish kroner per month (66,000 Swedish)
I'm not sure how true it is but there's also this idea that it can be hard to travel in Spain if you get outside of the major tourist spots because of the language barrier
Would you say that's true
The reality is that a minority of Europeans speak Spanish after all so that could be part of the explanation I suppose
People simply don't learn an entirely new language to be able to go on summer holiday
Danish: bæ (or bae), meaning poop
English: bae, your boyfriend/girlfriend
Seems that most people missed the point of your question
They actually *are* related, both deriving from Proto-Germanic *bikwemaną. The semantic break is interesting, but not too complicated:
In Proto-Germanic, *bikwemaną could mean either "to happen", "to arrive at" or "to obtain, find".
So German basically kept the last meaning of "to obtain/get", whereas English kept the meanings of "to happen" and "to arrive", but added an additional meaning of "to turn into".
You can still see traces of the "to happen" meaning in English phrases such as "what became of him
", whereas the "to arrive" meaning is found in Shakespeare
I don't even live in a cpuntry that speaks their language, yet somehow it drowns out my country's news

Which leaves me with England

Denmark and below freezing don't go hand in hand
We've had like 3 days with below freezing this winter
It's barely been below freezing in Denmark this winter
The dark can be a bit depressing though
Winter in Denmark isn't below freezing temperatures anymore, at least not where I live
Global warming made sure of that
Disappointed you chose Sweden over Denmark or Norway
Norwegians are always welcome in Denmark, Swedes are a different topic tho
Wow, why
What made you fall in love
I’m interested
You’re always welcome to hit me up, if you decide you wanna learn the language

That's about spot on
We have similar nature (except mountains) as a lot of Scandinavia, and we have a lot of the same architectural styles as the Netherlands
We also share the same bike culture
It's a snow/no snow difference
I love that Norwegians and Swedes buy beer in Denmaek, because it’s “cheap” but Danes buy beer in Germany because it’s “cheap”
Actually not
It’s about the same price in Germany and Poland
I was the opposite
Started talking to my dad about someone who’s baby cried
My dad said “she shouldn’t grab her like that” and a few other such criticism, until she said “sorry, she’s quite a handful” in perfect Danish
She was really nice and we ended up chit chatting a lot, but then I realized how rude it actually was
Not doing that again
Did the opposite
At a jazz Club in Vienna with our School
after a few beers my friends and I went to the toilet and we saw a Girl laying down ill, with people all around her
My friend comes with a stupid joke about her drinking to much to quick (“cold before 12” as we say in Denmark)
Her friend turns around and says in Danish, “no, she just forgot her medicine at the hotel”... turns out another Danish school was attending the same concert in the same small jazz club as us
really embarising
TIL that there are different decks of cards
And also, this explains something
My father plays L'Hombre (a very old Spanish card game) and you have to take out cards of the deck to get down to 40 cards
Now I understand that this is because the game was originally played with Spanish cards :D
Edit: A lot of people a speaking of 52 cards in the "French" deck - which is the one we use in Denmark
But isn't there only 51 cards in that one
12 in each of the four colors and 3 jacks
I knew the "normal" deck was called French, so that kind of implies that there are other types of decks from other countries or regions
But I have never seen or heard of any, until now
Except of course the UNO deck :-)
yeah no, literally never seen or heard of it before
>  l'hombre, how do you play it
I barely know
My daughter and I only asked him to teach us this summer
Found the rules for it
In Denmark its pretty dying
Only men 70-80+ play it
In many countries a variation of it called quadrille (or something) is more known
close enough
In Denmark, we translate Jack to Knægt and Queen to Dame
The King is the same word, but in Danish, Konge
That's already a rule in Denmark
though i dont recall how often they gotta pass
It's NOT an actual test though, it's more of a valuation by a doctor
he doesn't judge the persons ability to tell what to do in certain situations on the road
just weither or not he can hear/see properly
I'd like a proper license test, for EVERY SINGLE person with a license, every 5 years or so
so many people are terrible idiotic morons behind a wheel
It does not only depend on the temperature
E.g. if the temperature is 10 °C, but it's a gray rainy and windy day it is miserably cold here
But if the temperature is still 10 °C and the sun shines from a blue sky down on the snow covered landscape, and there is no wind, it can feel almost like summer
(But honestly, the latter scenario happens  once every 100 years here)
15 °C is warm, below it's jacket weather
25 °C is hot, and above that it's mostly unbearingly  hot and humid here
It depends
If it's windy or rains even a little bit, probably 10-15
If it's clear then 5
It was 10 degrees outside today, but the sun was out, so it was far too warm for anything but a t-shirt while working and maybe a thin long sleeved shirt when resting
Damn, 23-24 is our “wow it was soooo hot yesterday, like don’t get me wrong I like a good Summer day but I don’t hope it goes on for weeks”...
> You must have really dry weather,
We have an average humidity of like 200% or something, and rarely a day goes by, where the wind doesn't blow at least 5 m/s.
5 degrees can be absolutely bone chilling cold here
Hey fellow northerner
First word was blue for me too
Have you heard of seasonal depression
Because that honestly doesn’t sound normal
I never realized how accustomed I am to the darkness until now
We joke about winter depression here but it’s obviously very real
Try doing something that works better in the dark like watching movies or reading by candlelight, and remember to take vitamin D supplements if you feel like you’re not getting enough sunlight
A Danish poet wrote that the year has 15 months
January, February, March, April, May, June, Juli, August, September, October, November, November, November, November and December
I start loosing my mind a little bit in February and forget that is was ever nice and warm outside
In Danish we say "store nosser"  which means big balls and is synonymous with being brave
We also say "lange nosser"  which means long balls and is synonymous with something unpleasant, annoying or otherwise negative thing happening to you
Closest is [this] (today's risky click
But really I don't think we use the term in Danish
Our best one is "at nosse sig sammen" = "to balls yourself together" (doesn't make literal sense in Danish either), when you gotta pull yourself together and do that thing you're supposed to
Don’t we just say to have balls in general
Siger man ikke normalt "lange løg" i stedet for "lange nosser"?
Yeah you're right, I think I'm using too much danglish in my every day life
Jeg har hørt begge dele, men da jeg stod i lære som maskinarbejder lærte jeg en del farverige udtryk hvoraf et af dem var "Det er lige til at få dårlig pik og lange nosser af
Fin means pretty, dude
You too
The only bad thing I've heard about Switzerland (excluding potential political differences etc
as is a potential problem with every country on the planet) is the claim that Swiss people are supposedly rude
However, that claim usually comes from Americans or Southern Europeans who are used to that very "outwardly social" mentality, small talk etc
and they say the same about all of Northern Europe, Central Europe and Eastern Europe so it seems more like it's them being the outliers and not everyone else
So to what extent the "Swiss people are rude
" thing is true or not I have no idea
If "rude" simply means a more reserved or "Let's not bother other people for no reason" mentality like in Germany, Denmark etc
I don't see that as rude at all and certainly not as a bad thing
I enjoy not being "bothered" when I'm just out and about in public, just because I'm going shopping doesn't mean I'm interested in talking to every random person I see on the way there
I would rather retire in Medellin Colombia
Switzerland is too expensive
I voted for a candidate of the party I support because I respect him deeply
He is charismatic, trustworthy and important for me, he is young
He's fighting for better school systems, and kids in general
If I could only vote for something I believed in, my vote vould never be cast as I really don’t have any significant trust or faith in any candidate or party
We call it “politikerlede” or “dislike of politicians” here
Instead I vote “defensively”.
That is ... who is MOST LIKELY to win that I ABSOLUTELY DON’T want to win
Then I vote on whoever stands a chance at denying that first candidate or party a win
I suppose that places me in the “lesser evil” camp
Dont really agree 100% with any of the politicians, so i just vote for the one i am closest to, unless there's someone with a hilarious name, then he/she has deserved it
Can I ask who it was
Jacob Mark from SF
The danish youth smokes the most out of all Nordic countries, or atleast out of all Scandinavian countries, I don’t remember
Some 20-25 percent of the population smokes (it varies a bit from year to year, since it mostly decreases, but has actually increased again)
Smoking is very much correlated to people's social inheritance and class, though
I work at a high school - i.e. a place where most employees are academics - and to my knowledge, less than 5 out of approx
85 employees smoke
On the other hand, I've lived at a dorm and noticed that the majority of people who came from working class families smoked like chimneys, especially when they hung out with each other
The latter seems to be a general tendency in friend groups (and to a somewhat slighter degree in families) - either everyone smokes or no-one smokes
The question is more about the increase of snus in Denmark
I go to the Sanish equivalent of high school where snus is everything
My principality have issued, as of today, no smoking at all during school even outside school grounds
Every smoker who want to be more discreet is probably going to use snus more often since it's easier to hide
[That’s exactly the same pattern as here
] They’re about to raise the price thankfully
I understand that a large portion of the decrease in smokers is due to taxation and public sentiment, but how much would you wager that the use of snus, especially among young people, has affected smoking rates
Cause at least in Denmark, snus has been getting bigger and bigger since the mid 2010's, so much so that it has helped decrease the amount of youths who smoke
This sounds very good
But snüs consumption is still VERY high in Norway, and that’s unhealthy af still
The only "positive" thing to happen in recent years in regards to youth smoking, is the rise in prevalence of snus
At least we're getting addicted to something which doesn't directly cause cancer now lol
wow so the cool thing is to skate and wear baggy clothes
that sounds unfortunate
Yes, I guess, the last one is pretty unfortunate
Hahah, thats true, some people I know both smoke and take snus
Snus is still pretty awful afaik - a friend of a friend had to get surgery because his gums were practically rotting from using the stuff
Probably still better as it doesn’t affect the people around you like smoking does though
Very popular among youth in Denmark as well
The ones sold in super markets and gas stations are tobacco free versions with added nicotine to circumvent the EU ban
And it's also quite popular to drive to Sweden and buy a bunch to sell in Denmark
Kinda like Norway with driving to Sweden/Denmark for cheap alcohol
If you are already addicted to nicotine you'll probably like it
wow no, an average (cheap) cigarette pack costs 55dkk (AUD$12) and next year theyre gonna increase it to 65dkk (AUD$16)
They just raised the taxes so a pack went from 6 euros to around 8
Don't think you are allowed to advertise for tobacco here
A bit surprised it isn't an EU wide ban
yeah i know someone that puts three sachets in at a time
he is partly swedish tho ;)
You're right, it is still very unhealthy and should be avoided
Yet something can be said for the fact that it doesn't cause cancer (that we know of)
Gum surgery, as much as it probably sucks, has a hellll of a lot higher survival rate than cancer
really
because we can buy it here everywhere
actually NOBODY dresses like that
thats some cringe ass shit
Makes more sense then hahah
i get them mixed up all the time
fucking hate it when you go to take out your vape but it turns out it's an e-meth
be careful
Since you're from Hamburg, a tip if you wanna try snus, is that you can actually buy it in basically any gas station in Denmark
It's not with tobacco, since u know, illegal in the EU, but it's the "tobacco free" versions which taste and feel the same, and the brands are all Swedish
The reason for this, is that snus is insanely popular not only in Sweden, but Denmark and Norway too
In Copenhagen people often drive across the bridge to Sweden and load up on thousands of kr
worth of snus, and sell it back in Denmark
Either it is tobacco-free, or it is illegal
If you for example go to [one of the biggest snus sites online,] it will inform you that you need to switch to the EU site
On there, they only sell nicotine pouches, as these are not banned by the EU, and are not ***technically*** snus, as it is not tobacco
Nicotine pouches and snus are pretty much the same thing, and the words are used interchangeably
Both are the same concept, a flavored way of delivering nicotine in a pouch under the lip
Only difference is lack of tobacco, and legality in the EU
I remember seeing someone a while ago asking if it was worth it to move from USA to Switzerland for a certain job
Was that you
Stop calling it a Danish
It's a fucking atrocity
Also, it's not an "open faced sandwich", it's fucking smørrebrød
When tourists pronounce Copenhagen as Kopenhagen as if we are Germans
We are not Germans and we don't sound alike
These are pretty funny
But also kinda justified with some of them
I gagged at the Cinnamon buns with cream cheese
Obviously, you guys are enjoyable
Never really understood this mentality regarding my fellow Danes
It’s so silly to discuss wether Finland is Scandinavian or non-Scandinavian as we are very much alike - despite our languages that is
How come it annoys Finns being called Scandinavian
I love the Finns’ culture and country but I won’t have any of that Finland is Scandinavian nonsense
In Denmark your country’s name is literally Holland
And it gets really really weird as a Dane when I realized holland was a region or place
Nederlandene would probably be correct to use but on the maps it’s literally holland
As well as the football name and such
This also annoys me to great extents
When I see someone online be like "Oh I'm actually Danish", I like to respond with something in Danish and wait for their confused reply as to which language I just wrote in
I’ve never heard about it, what is it about
Never heard about that “joke” before
Also ""Danish'es"" aren't even fucking Danish, they're Austrian
(Er det ikke dem vi kalder for spandauer
No sauce
Why
I don’t really care
If they want to be Scandinavians they can be, and if they don’t, I still thinks it’s totally fine
>  Finland is geographically in Scandinavia¨
Scandinavia isn't a geographical region, it's a cultural one
Finland is not within that cultural region
Didn't Americans also start celebrating "Leif Ericcsons Day" instead of Colombus day for some weird reason
We also use "Holland" for the country, and "Hollændere" for the people as well
It's so annoying and I don't know if you've experienced this but then when you talk about Danish culture or something they have no idea what you're talking about
Ja, det er den amerikanske version af en spandauer
I was purely talking about in terms of language
Danish is not that close to German as some tourists might believe, and our capital is not pronounced as such
This is like calling every slavic person a Russian since they are of slavic ethnicity
Ethnicity =/= Nationality
Also, Germanic =/= German
Danes are Germanic, yes, but not German
That is a weird way of saying mountain-monkies
I did struggle with putting out a comprenhesible sentence I must admit
It’s at least better than being called Russian, right
No we aren't!
Don’t forget the Faroe Islands and Greenland, unless you just meant to include them in “Denmark”
Oh now I get it
I’ve never looked at the name that way
Thanks for explaining
I thought it was referring to a famine, like under the Soviets or something
Reminds me of the Penguins from Madagascar: "just smile and wave boys, smile and wave"
Geesh, wait till someone tells this guys that Iceland isn't a part of Scandinavia either
But why
I honestly see both you and the baltic countries as part of the nordic countries
I've heard it's an Austrian pastry, which just thickens the plot even more
Close, very close my Irish friend
My girlfriend is Mexican and everyone I meet in Mexico makes that kind of joke XD
I don't.
Why not
Well, they're simply not nordic, they have a completely different historical and cultural backgrounds as countries
Fair enough honestly
I respect that
We tend to take things way too lightly compared to other countries
I didn't know that Denmark had the 4th longest coastline in the world (when counting Greenland and the Faroe Islands)
In Danish it’s appelsin, same meaning
Moldova can only dream of the day it can afford to take that title
I just joined the subreddit today
How do I obtain a flair if you don't mind me asking
It depends on where you sunbathe - on the beach in Jylland (Danish mainland) many sunbathe topless, but I've noticed that in and around Copenhagen, many don't. I suspect it's because of population density, among other things
Personally, I sunbath topless if I notice other people are doing it as well, and I've never felt like it was weird or odd to do so
But depending on where I did it, I was either in the minority or majority
When I was a child I feel like everybody did it though - my mum, grandmother, aunts, strangers - nobody wore tops
From what I've seen in Southern Zealand, Denmark, it is at most 3-4 for women, and 80% for overweight men
In Scandinavia 0,1%
I'd say maybe around 5% or less
It's not unheard of
I guess that British guy is just a hornball who see one girl topless and focuses on them, not noticing the rest lol
That's definitely one likely reason but prudishness or something like that may also explain some of it
I don't know the numbers for Denmark but media has covered it more than once going back more than a decade, before mobile phones and digital cameras became widespread
Something else may be at play
Even if we just look at recent years I'm not sure everything can be explained by fear of peeping toms taking fotos
One related phenomenon in Denmark is that people don't want to use communal showers as much as before
I'm sure there's always been some that never enjoyed that but apparently in the recent decade or so more and more students skip gym class or just change clothes without showering
It also affects  communal showers at private gyms/fitness centers and public swimming pools
It's more an issue among women but also men, and not only younger people though more so
The change has been attributed to, among other things, social media and the need to keeping up appearances
Whatever the reason something has changed how some people perceive partial or full nudity in public or semi public situations
Not convinced it's an issue needing a solution though, except perhaps if it negatively affects some people in various ways if they lack a positive body image (oh and the expenses related to building private showers I guess)
Society's views on things change
Yeah it might be a change going that far back
Though I'm sure cameras in recent years have accelerated any longer term trend or societal norm
Take a look at the Swedish comments
We celebrate those things too
In Denmark there were a lot of holidays in late Spring because of crop-harvesting and some religious holidays
Later this got too much since we had stopped being a heavy farming country and so they made "Store Bededag" (Grand Prayers Day) which is essentially a mix of all the many holidays we had in April, May and early June
In Denmark we have the same tradition, but in the midsummer
Most places make a toy witch to burn on the fire, to make a replication of the witch-burnings in the middle ages
However the day is called Saint Hans Night, named after John the baptist
We celebrate it too, in denmark :)
Yeah, Sankt Hans aften in June
We put a witch on there, usually made by school children
[Villy Søvndal, our former foreign minister is probably the most famous one
We used to have a Minister called Willie Søvndal
I believe he was then Minister of foreign relations
He barely spoke English, and his terrible speeches are still joked about today
He is actually still politically active, and I think I saw something about him running for mayor of my city at one point
Came here to post this
Was my thought too, but its also difficult to blame people of his generation to suck at english
Sure, and they do have interpreters with them when meeting with representatives from other countries anyway
Still, if you are going to be the minister of foreign affairs and actually give presentations in English, you might want to practice a bit more
Happy cake day by the way
Oh, didnt even notice, haha, thats one year on reddit for me lol
And well, its well documented that its more difficult to learn as you get older, and Villy was not exactly young by any means
The dude meant well and had a good message, but yeah he sounded hillarious speaking english
Like there is the things the vikings did, but if i didn't get to choose that then i would say the Stockholm Bloodbath is pretty high up there
In 1951 Denmark conducted an experiment, where "we"1 forcefully removed 22 kids from their families in Greenland
As far as I can tell, it was an attempt to "Educate the savages".
They where put in an orphanage, taught Danish and sent to Danish school
Some where adopted, but most stayed in the orphanage
They never returned to their families
The experiment was a horrible failure
I was under the impression that it was a lot more than 22, but it's still terrible
This is simply not true
The conditions on Greenland were so bad, that child mortality was very high because of tuberculosis among other thing
Red Cross wanted to help children that was already taken from their families because of bad conditions by sending them to a Danish foster care
This happened with the accept of the local Inuit leadership on Greenland and it was so attractive that more well-off Inuit families made sure to have their children enrolled in the Red Cross program
More here: [Google translate]
I think "simply" is the wrong word
There's several different views on the matter
Google translate won't work on this link on my phone, but there's more of the same
> There's several different views on the matter
Yes, some are historical, others are political/sensational
goed
Child porn was legal for ten years
Granted, it was primarily because of a loophole in the law -we were the first country to legalize and industrilize porn, and nobody really thought to make an additional law against porn with children when sex with them was already illegal
But many, including respected politicians opposed a ban
Something about pedophiles needing outlets and "well, sometimes they're not REALLY hurting them
We occupied Norway for four hundred years, and just to rub it in we called it a "union". Fun times (except for Norway)
As many other European nations we did a lot of bad stuff during the slave trade years
I'll instead tell you about something more recent
In the 1950's 22 Greenlandic kids were sent to Denmark,
as an initial experiment to see if it were possible to better educate native Greenlandics
What initially was meant as a one year educational thing, instead ended up looking more like something akin to ethnic cleansing
Instead up coming home to their parents, the kids were either put up for adoption or sent to a foster home
The kids were forbidden from speaking Inuit and were attempted stripped of their Greenlandic identity as much as possible
Many of the kids from the experiment died young and the once that did not were left with severe emotional trauma
This is surely not the worst thing to happen in the history of Denmark, but the fact that it happened in the 50's shortly after the atrocities of WW2 makes me look at it a pretty horrible thing
Start with the real bad stuff:  The Reliant Robin
1807 ya meanies
> Hoo boy where to start
Cliff Richard
You only lost a battle, the treasonous colonials can still be brought back under the crown
First, it took some time for people to even kind of be aware that it was a thing
Porn was still taboo
One politician randomly discovered it by walking by a porn cinema one day
Second, a lot of people were afraid to mess with foreign countries like that
The majority of the underage porn was produced in other countries such as Thailand and the Philippines and then sold here
"We can't control what other countries do".
Third -the scariest one- we were just fucking hippies
Or a lot of people were
The sexual revolution was happening and on steroids, and some felt that children to varying degrees were a natural part of that
Things like having "fucking rooms" in hippie community where children were allowed to watch their parents
No talk about boundaries, no #Metoo
A LOT of adults were also sexually assaulted in this boundary-free time
It should be as "free" and "natural" as possible
Some advocated as I said that nude pictures or soft core child porn were "just playing with them naked" and "they don't even understand what's happening" and "we're just encouraginh them to be comfortable with their bodies".
Well its only in 2015 that we banned bestiality, so a lot of the opposition to that law still are
> Likewise with Norway and Denmark
I don't know if we ever had such a programme
We should have, as there still are too many retards around here
Like you
>Ah, no can do, they need to pay us back first
Pay you back
Does Germany not still own Greece WWII reparations
No, I am super smart
So kind of the opposite
We have something similar in Denmark
Except we burn a witch on a big bonfire, and then we sing some songs about it
We still practice the tradition of Jul or (Yule in old Nordic/German ) in Denmark
It was just adopted by christianity
We still use pagan traditions like “Nisser” and “Goat” and “Julefrokost” all part of ancient traditions
Sankt Hans, maybe
It is the same as celebrating midsummer, but you burn a witch-doll on a bonfire
The town I live in used to burn a bunch of (what they deemed to be) witches back in the middle ages
Edit: Bonfire
Is Lucia a pagan tradition
I always thought it had it's roots in Christianity
Don't forget the thorsfejde
Don’t know about that
That must be a swedish thing
So would that be before or after the snaps
My father’s brother always did this after the snaps and the fist fight just kept going till the last of them was down ( by the way 5 brothers)
A Dane that can't ride a bicycle and drink a beer
A Dane who doesn't like rye bread
That is bordering treason
A Dane who don't enjoy hygge
A dane that doesnt live in a house of lego
A Dane who doesn’t like coffee
Didn't realize all of Scandinavia was high on that list lol
Same here
Same here
At the same time
Im pretty sure it's illegal to drink while riding a bike anyway
Let's hang out and not drink together then
Cheers
I know a surprisingly high amount of people that hate coffee
>Im pretty sure it's illegal to drink while riding a bike anyway
No, as long as you can drive safely [it's okay
It is perfectly legal to drink a beer while driving a car or riding the bike
As long as you are below the alcohol limit and you are still able to drive safely
Yea
They are probably from swedish decent
Fucking Sweden
Lies
We don't get cold weather
>As long as you are below the alcohol limit
There is not an alcohol limit on bike
But you need to be able to dive safely or else you are fined 1,500 kr
What do you mean
Coffee is isn't culturally big here at all
Nothing's a bad excuse if you can blame the danes ;)
En sol (common/utrum)
En måne (common/utrum)
If I had to assign them genders, I would say that the sun was female, and the moon male
In Danish both are common gender: _solen_, _månen_.
We have two different neutral “genders”. Both sun and moon are -en, which is the most common one
About 70% of words are -en and 30% are -et
Solen = The sun, is Together-gender, and so is Månen = The moon
Neither are our other gender, which is called genderless
Solen (the Sun) and månen (the Moon) are Both neutral, as it should be
We were in Hamburg, Germany
On our last day we went to the parking place where our car was, and driving out of there a van had parked blocking the exit
Looking behind the van was like 8 guys with masks and guns about to do a full on robbery, so we just floor it and drive around the van
Very weird experience
We where somewhere in Croatia
I was five or so and it was my first vacation outside of Denmark
We where sleeping in a tent we rented
First night we rented tent but at around midnight a porcupine gets into our tent and into the mattresses
We get a new tent
On our last night it rains heavely and our tent gets flood
Because we couldn't get a new tent we drive to a nearby town and stay there
On our way home out of the city my dad opens a window while we drive over a huge puddle
I was right in the path of the water and gets my last dry clothes wet
It was a horrible trip home
was in Sarajevo in Bosnia Herzegovina
to be fair, the trip itself was awesome and something i would like to do again
but we were stopped at the border because we forgot some of the papers for the car
after some back and forth, the officer there told us that he was gonna go inside the building again, and when he came back my dad would give him his passport again
my dad got the hint, slipped a couple hundred euros (dont remember the exact amount) into the passport and gave it to the officer
now, the officer then took the passport, went directly over to an officer with a bigger fancier hat than him and gave him the passport
my dad thought he was gonna go to jail for bribing a border officer
but after some time the first officer came back with the passport and said there were no problems and we could get into the country
the money inside the passport was gone too
best part, my dad only told me once we were home from vacation
I don't really have any bad stories about traveling in Europe, it's all been pretty great so far
I saw a local guy get beaten by police once but that was in Tunisia so that doesn't count
No clue what that was all about
The worst thing that has happened to me on a vacation happened right here in Denmark, and it's not really much of a horror story, just bad luck
When I was like 10 years old or something I was at the beach on a day where the underwater visibility was very low, so I was diving right along the bottom so I could see any potential crabs or whatever down there
At some point I look up and see something red ahead of me
I couldn't see what exactly it was so I decided to surface to try and avoid it but since I still had some forward momentum I ended up going face first into a big ass jellyfish and I got stung pretty fucking badly
First all over the face, then it continued to slide down along my stomach, and then down my legs and feet
That was some serious fucking pain but luckily it didn't last too long
I was okay and "functioning" again by evening
Hmm, one of my best vacations was in that area but that was quite a few years ago
Maybe it's been "damaged" by overtourism since then
When I was there it was all nice and relaxed and the locals were super nice to a kid like me, the hotel was nice etc
When did you go there
I think we saw police with sirens like 15 minutes later
We were mostly focused on leaving
Ohh yeah
Yeah stuck in our tent and we couldn't get it out
In my city Aalborg we have hvis statue of a bull
It's a city landmark and sits right in the middle of the most used street
Thousand of people pass right by it every day
A couple of years ago some guy from Copenhagen came forward saying he had stolen a sword from the statue, 16 years prior  while on a bender in the city, and he had been too afraid of telling anybody about it since
Nobody in the whole city had noticed that it was missing until he cam forward
Edit: I don't know if it was clear that what he stole was a sword which was part of the statue
And it was facing right at alle the people passing
Linearbandkeramiks culture
man
if I could give money in order to never hear that name again, I would
Sincerely,

They were in western Europe, parts of France and western Denmark, i believe
Odense in Denmark, has good hotels, good food and is a lovely place
The whole [island of Fyn] is more or less ignored by many tourists
We mostly get Germans with camping vans/trailers and Chinese who want to see HC Andersen stuff
Most tourists skip the island and either go to Copenhagen or Aarhus
But Fyn has some 'off the beaten path' attractions and some of the "least crowded" beaches and museums
Lots of smaller cities you can fully explore in a day
Decent size forests (by Danish standards) you can also explore easily in a day or camp overnight if you want to
Just been in Nove Mesto nad Metuji and at the Adrspach rocks
Great stuff
German is for sure the go to Language if you wish to work in Europe, since it is not only the primary Language in Germany, Austria, Liechtenstein and Switzerland, it is also a second/third Language for northern european countries and eastern european countries, which makes german a Very good Language to learn second to english ofc
Depends on the job
I interact with a lot of eastern european truck drivers (mainly romanian, latvian, lithuanian and bulgarian people) so russian would be great for me
The language of whereever you're living
That seems pretty obvious unless I misunderstands the question
Depends a lot on what the CCP wants to do
The "rich" countries have had their economic development basically stagnante, meanwhile Asian and African countries are doubling their economy in 5-10 years
One can't deny the growth and influence that Asia will have in the future and you definitely can't deny the potential for Mandarin to be the lingua franca
Not true, most jokes are against Sweden
Most *language* jokes are against us
> That apparently the Danish are like the butt of every *language joke told by other Scandinavians
This is Swedish propaganda
I use olive oil for Southern cuisine and butter for more Northern things
Canola oil when Asian and/or I’ve given up in life
Every time there's a "how do you say X in your language" I find a Norwegian/Swedish comment and don't bother with the "same" anymore
It's the same on r/etymologymaps \- what's the word for cheese
ost, ost and ost in Scandinavia, okay (Iceland coming in with "ostur" or something)
Obviously no surprise our languages are similar, but they're *really* similar
> Finns used to ride logs on rivers and pre-christianity believed vaginas had magical powers
Sure
"pre-christianity"
They sleep so well in the cold
Especially if it’s a bit windy
My son could sleep an extra hour outside, when it was really cold (in Iceland)
You’re right
I could write a whole rambling about how tired I am of the potato jokes and how I feel like they may legitimately hurt our language but I’m too tired
That’s a new one
Butter is great if you want a buttery taste
For most things I use rapeseed oil
Oh no, they don't want to be Baltic but they're considered that
They 100% wants to be nordic which they are not considered
And then he said “Danish sounds like someone is speaking with a potato in their mouth
Funniest shit I’ve ever seen
>(Don't mention nynorsk, let it die)
Its funny that there are so varied beliefs on Nynorsk
But yeah, it's a weird language based on some guy travelling to small remote random villages and declaring their version of Norwegian to be the "true" Norwegian
Anyway, according to Wikipedia it is in decline and has been so for some time
Haha, you win :D danified Finns, bwahaha
Remember that one time some US right wingers got in a meme fight with r/sweden
That had me laughing for a full week
Probably the latter
But all the same, it’s enjoyable for our Nordic offspring
No worries, it’s not you guys’ fault primarily
But as someone who enjoys linguistics, it kind of feels like you’re cursed with an ugly language
It’s to the point where even Danes are being raised with the “Germanic languages are ugly, Romance languages are pretty” beauty standards
I very rarely hear any kind of appreciation for Danish, even by Danes themselves (unless badly translating memes count), and I’ve heard “why don’t we just switch to English lol” more than once
As a joke, but still
Sometimes I really wish my first language was French or Spanish, having a lot of people learning it and thinking it’s beautiful
Anecdotal I know, but both my big sister and little sister put their babies to sleep outside, and neither is an outdoorsy type at all
I’ve heard a danish woman in her 50s saying we should switch to English
I laughed, but then realised she was deadly serious
I know an Icelandic girl who finds danish sexy (especially English with a danish accent)
So there’s that
I find beauty in the huge variations in the different dialects around the country
> Sometimes I really wish my first language was French or Spanish
Sometimes I have that same thought, but then I remember that only 6 million people on the planet speak it, which is 0,08% of the world population
I find it kind of beautiful and unique to know such a small language
Well
I don't know
I don't care about the Latin languages, but if Danish sounded a bit more like Norwegian then that would nice
"Danes have a funny sounding language" was not a thing internationally before internet meme culture
The fact that it has become a meme at all is testament to Sweden's strong presence online
I'm almost proud of my brothers
Sweden is by far the biggest one of the Scandinavian countries
It makes sense it would get chosen as a nationality for a character for children’s show from another continent over Denmark
Very often I see things that are basically just Swedish getting lumped onto us as well
Like how all of Eastern Europe are seen as “basically Russia”.
> So how come it's the Swedish chef and not Danish chef on the muppets of the Danes have the weird language
Oddly enough that character is called the Danish Chef in the German version of The Muppet Show
I'm not sure why they changed it
Free world class healtcare, free schools and universities, high pay, wide and strong social security rate - probably
>especially English with a danish accent
That's just cursed
Ej mange tak
Det er enormt sødt
Er du i Danmark eller lærer du det bare for sjov
It certainly would be a secret language
You can (with some precautions) talk openly about whatever you want when traveling abroad
I think you’re right about a lot of things, but I do think language speakers have very different amounts of pride in their language
Similarly to how a lot of Italians and Frenchmen and Spaniards are really proud of their cuisine, just turned up to a ten
Sure we have some pride in our frikadeller, but not nearly enough as the French have in their regional cuisine
I guess years and years of bullying the Swedes has come back to haunt us
Denmark saved so many jews, and it was mainly doable thanks to sweden - gotta admit that
That's almost the Danish winter
Although it's usually a bit warmer - so that you can get drenched in 1 degrees cold water which the wind sweeps straight into your bones
I think it is pretty universal for non-english speakers to dislike English with their native accent
I personally hate English with a Danish accent
Norway gets all the attention internationally though
I never see Denmark mentioned :'(
That is a hilarious comment
But they absorb the gløgg, and swell up and become little morsels of sweet happiness
You could at least help us this time around
I like Icelandic English, even though I’m a native speaker (it can get a bit cringe if people overdo it, though)
Du har kun lavet en enkelt fejl, som rigtig mange danskere også lavet hele tiden - nogen vs nogle
Nogen er ental, nogle er flertal
Dit dansk er nydeligt, fortsæt det gode arbejde
I'm strongly considering putting the Christmas lights up around the house
It's getting darker now, and I really like a bit of light in the dark months
Not even the ones that have been soaking in rum for a few months before they're added to the glögg
I would say Corfitz Ulfeldt
The reason Denmark lost Skåne Halland and Blekinge
I’m sorry, but any sane person would say Pavelic, atleast between those two
Funny thing is, Danes have absolutely no idea who he is
> When I team up with Romanians in Counter Strike, I somehow always ask them what they think about Ceausecu
That's some downright strange servertalk
> Funny thing is, Danes have absolutely no idea who he is
Of course we do
He was a bad king here as well,. There is a reason that he was imprisoned for the rest if his life
Well I know that I don’t have the knowledge of croat, on this topic
But I have read alot about both Tito and Pavelic, and therefor I wrote that, but I’m sure you as a croat, know something that I don’t.
I never claimed he was a good man
quality small-talk right there
>I always learned in my history class that you called him Christian the good
Swedish propaganda I guess
Maybe
It is certainly not true
&#x200B;
He was extremely unpopular in Denmark
He introduced a new lawcode, and it was promptly burned publicly in Viborg just to spite him
Then he was kicked out of Denmark, and later imprisoned for more than 25 years when he returned
To me it sounded like an angry rebuttal (e.g. "*how dare you make a light-hearted comparison out of this terrible man
*") but I wasn't sure
That's why I added the question mark because I didn't want to offend him
Grammar - not that hard
Pronunciation - I honestly have never even seen someone that didn’t live here from childhood that sounded even close to native
From my experience teaching Danish at the Danish learning Discord server, and experience from living here
Grammar + vocab = Pretty easy
Pronunciation: I have yet to be fooled by anyone
Especially the Danish 'stød' is awful to learn as well as the soft d's
I've met like, maybe 2 or 3 people, who could ALMOST pull it off
They were all Dutch
This guy is pretty good:
True, my Norwegian grandmother lived here for 40+ years, she still didn’t sound native
I love German grammar
And the language, too
Every time I hear the potato or kamelåså joke I die a little inside because it’s so old
However, then I remember it’s because the rest of Scandinavia hasn’t produced any original humor for a couple of decades, so I forgive them
I’m impressed if someone knows one word of Danish
Yeah
I can tell when I'm listening for it that he's not a native, but I'm not sure I'd realise he's a foreigner if I just met him and didn't know
I've heard that before too, I even heard that some people were confused why a guy like Jan Heintze never played for the Dutch national team, because they never realised he wasn't Dutch
There's something about how he pronounces his e's and the word "uddannelse" (and a few other sounds/words) that would sound a bit foreign to me even if I didn't know
But yeah, otherwise I haven't heard any other adult learner speak as relatively accent-free as this guy
Yeah we don’t really care about Norway
Bullying [Sweden] is [where it’s at]
Fewer hours would create more jobs though
They would pay less, but still
Nederlands electronic music
They are literally pioneers in EDM, and so many events there too
It's a cool culture there
also Hagelslag
Although liking Swedish products is treason, every Dane does it
Gifflar, Marabou, Malaco candy, Pågen and many more
Thanks Germany for cheap Candy and Soda across the border
I give thnaks to all of the entene for winning ww1, we were neutral, and afterwards in 1920 we could have an election in Schleswig-Holstein to allow self determination, I dont think A Germany not within serious civil trouble would have let their northern part go, no matter how many danes lived there
Thank you norway for being awesome
Thank you Canada for the best war ever
Thank you sweden fo- wait what
Jokes aside, thank you sweden for helping us save the danish jews in ww2
It was just before Christmas
of course we've got your back
I'm pretty sure we ran out of yeast in quite recent history where we got offered supplies (yeast) by Norway
Also billar
And thank you for the whisky
For everyone else who doesn't know about the Canadian-Danish war, here is some completely neutral information:
You mean the danish Hans Island
Thank you for the best war ever
Let us be an example for the rest of the world
Not trying to steal any thunder from our Norwegian buddies, but I think I speak for pretty much everyone in the Nordics when I say that we all like Scotland very much
If you guys ever separate from the rest of the UK and get real independence, you will be a welcome new member in the Nordic council if you wish
Just don't tell Estonia
As a Dane - I'm sorry for a messy breakup
We weren't able to protect you during WW2, and we completely understand that you wanted to be independent
No hard feelings from this side - and unless we are playing against each other, all Danes always cheer for Iceland in international football or handball matches
Oh, you can buy them everywhere in Denmark
Gifflar is likely the most beloved Swedish product in Denmark
Gifflar is no match for the mighty Citronmåne from Dancake
My brother-in-law and his family lived in Toronto for 6 months a couple of years back and enjoyed it very much
I have never been there myself, but I while I can't say anything bad about Canada, I must admit I also struggle to remember anything else than maple syrup when thinking about canadian products
Oh yeah, and the Canadarm
Personally, I think it would be pretty cool to just split the island down the middle
That way we can both have a second land border
Yes, yes it is
The canadians and the danes figured out the proper way to do war
Gifler IS better - there I said it, I feel dirty and will face any consequences of my actions
I can understand a little Swedish and Norwegian, but not much
For a long time, I wasn't really able to tell the difference between Norwegian and Swedish
All I knew was, that if I had little trouble understanding it, it was most likely Norwegian
If it was a bit harder to understand, then it was most likely Swedish
But I wasn't able to put my finger on why one was easier than the other
Then the company I worked for was bought by a Norwegian company and I started talking a lot with them
I think I am pretty good at understanding Norwegian now, even from people who live pretty high up north
Swedish is still pretty hard if they don't slow down
Reading both Norwegian and Swedish is easy though
Icelandic is impossible and Faroese
no idea
I have never been exposed to it, and the few Faroese people I have met spoke Danish perfectly
It’s funny because as a Dane, I can understand 75% of written Dutch, but once they start talking
no clue, maybe 20%. And that’s from a Dane: our language is just as much a potato in the mouth as Dutch
> both Norwegian and Swedish is easy though
Icelandic is impossible and
Dude
Me too
I'm danish from CPH and lived half a year in Trondheim
The locals would be so sad when I told them that I had no idea if they were speaking Norwegian or Swedish
Faroese both looks and sounds to me like a Danish person trying to write/speak Icelandic, which really hurts my head, since I still barely understand any more of it than Icelandic
I'd say written Faroese is *slightly* easier than written Icelandic though, since it isn't quite as grammatically complex
Well
from the Danish side I think most people (or at least the younger generations) have completely forgotten that you guys where once part of the Kingdom
We generally love all of our Northern brethren, except the Swedish of course
Daily/semi-daily in the traditional news media
More than hourly if you browse r/popular
The biggest stories in our news media are rarely if ever about the US though
Our media is pretty good at keeping things grounded to Danish/european news and only mentioning American events in passing
It would definitly help if every little thing he does wasn't so damn stupid  I think news in general have a tendency to focus primarily on the negative, and right now there's definitly a lot of negatives in the US
The worst part is that the entire discourse has fallen to that level, trump said something stupid, so let's find the dumbest comment on that stupid statement possible to get the most outrageous headline
"Trump believes rakeing leaves will put out all forest fires" "Fires are inevitable and no amount of forest ordinance and maintenance could minimize them". It always has to be the most uninformed and extreme person
I agree with the\_pianst91 and the same applies for Denmark
I follow developments in Belarus pretty closely and each Sunday 1-200
000 pro-democracy protesters march and we hardly hear about it
But if 2000 BLM-supporters march in Portland
I think it has to do with language, accessibility and self-reinforcing effect
Every journalist here is pretty fluent in English and news about English-speaking countries is very easy to access from the source
We are also way overexposed to news about UK compared to France, Germany, Russia etc
I think a lot of American networks sell a lot of digested news to our networks
The supply-chain of news is just super effective
And because of this we know comparably a lot about US and UK and are thus able to consume and interested in higher quantities and qualities of nes from these countries
There is also a certain element of fascination with the US in our countries, especially in the kind of people who run the media business, although shitting on the US is so popular now they would hardly admit it
Some people in Denmark seem to care about the US internal politics in a manner they would otherwise only care about their own country
Hence why people hold BLM support protests all over the world, but basically no one holds Belarus support protests for instance
Not that I don't think BLM is a legitimate cause, but it just feels completely out of place to see people shouting out slogans and yelling I CAN*T BREATHE in English at a Danish protest
People have opininos about US politics in a way they would never have about the internal politics of another country - I would say that for the average Dane, the US political system is familiar but the one in neighboring Germany, a very important country, is quite obscure in comparison
First of all, i feel danish
In my bones, but just a whisper behind that, i feel nordic
I feel a historically and especially very cultural bond with the other nordic countries
After that, i embrace the diversity of europe
Where the other nordics are my brothers and sisters, the rest of europe are my cousins
Beyond that, no
I think the European identity is real, but not in the way most people talk about it
I identify with my region, the my country, then Scandinavia, and THEN European
i just want the kalmar union part 2 electric boogaloo
>I don't think that many Europeans could honestly say that Asian countries have the same connection to them as another European country, like, I can't see anyone in Finland saying that Spain is culturally more distant than Iraq or Syria or Turkey or Morocco, even though the distance isn't far off
Drop a Scot in New Zealand and another in Moldova and ask them a week in which one encountered the most cultural similarities
I personally didn't find New York and Melbourne more "foreign" than barcelona, and i don't mean that as a negative thing, it's just that real cultural affinity don't neatly fit into political constructs like "Europe", though of course there's bound to be some overlap
I have a friend who has said the same
Language is a big part of it I think but also stuff like having seen so much of your media
id argue full danish control would be ideal, but then again i might be slightly biased
But we danes feel we are scandinavians much more than continental europe
The little mermaid in Copenhagen
You can buy souvenirs bigger than the statue
But we have a lot of other nice places to see
My parents got dissapointed about Rome
Too dirty, too many scammers etc
The Little Mermaid in Copenhagen
Despite the name literally being The LITTLE Mermaid, people still seem to be disappointed by it's small size
It's kind of a tourist trap too, since there are a lot of expensive food stands around
Malmö, Sweden
I've hosted lots of tourists on Airbnb here in Copenhagen who had to try out Malmö to check Sweden off the list
They were disappointed as there really not much to do there
The streets are empty
Lots of lots boring compared to just staying in Copenhagen
Also - The little mermaid here in CPH
It's just a tiny statue
Don't bother
Everyone expects the statue to be some ancient, huge statue carved in a mountain or something
If you're in the area, take a day trip to Girona
Absolutely beautiful medieval town in the centre
Barcelona has some cool stuff though, I like it
> more rural areas, like Kreuzberg or Friedrichshain
Hol up
> London is also barely representative of England and feels like a foreign country at times
Well, that's part of London's appeal
It's been an international centre and a melting pot for almost two centuries
If I want to go see cottages and rural stuff, I'd go to Devon or something
Atomium is cool
Great way secure a Great Prophet
I think you should definitely go there
Kastellet, Langelinje, Amalienborg, the Marble Church, the view towards Holmen and so on are all great
The trip out there is really nice
It's just that the statue is uninteresting
Go for the journey, not the destination
Hippety hoppety
This is now all, vacation property
Încă nu am vizitat castelul, dar vreau să merge inainte devine Bran doi
> Just a 19th century escapist fantasy of what a castle is
I mean that in itself is interesting to me
When I backpacked in Australia I really wanted to go to Aernem Land to see the aboriginal stuff and tracks of the Macassan sailors, but since I couldnt rent a car it just wasnt feasible
My only regret from that trip still
Sweden, those Swedes better get back to their side of the lake
Heyyy
> Denmark in general
A nice all-rounder
I feel like all of Scandinavia dislikes Sweden
I feel like all of Scandinavia dislikes Sweden
This is the best comment I’ve seen online I think
HI NEIGHBOOR
You want some of the cookies I baked today
Svenskjävlar
Well Norway was part of either Sweden or Denmark for a long time
Just shows Norwegians are the most likable
I distinctly remember that being you guys idea
Nah of course not
Sibling hate ya know
Fax
Skåne is just as weird to us as it is to you
Idk they talk funny
Have you heard yourself haha
It's not a mix between swedish and Danish
It's harder to understand than, say, someone from Stockholm
Yes
yes it is
Skånian is literally swedified Danish, and has a ton of Danish words which typical Swedish doesn't. Skånsk also has the danish r-sound, unlike standard Swedish
The reason you find it harder to understand is because you have more exposure to Stockholm Swedish, not because Skånsk is more different from Danish
All I know is that I live right across from Skåne yet I cannot understand them at all (We have a lot of swedish costumers at work during the summer)
Well, the Scandinavian languages all influence each other, and were descended from old norse as far as I'm aware
I'm pretty sure we all spoke the same language at one point, but I'm not 100% sure on it
I have never heard about that before and Danish showers/bathrooms don't have a secondary drain
i've heard of it happening
but i dont believe it's a common thing at all
i have heard of something worse
people dying in an apartment, all lonely, and then the corpse rots and it basically ruins the apartment, and the neighbours call the building attendant because of the smell
TBH this sounds more like a rumour than an actual thing
I'm sure there is a good reason that Finnish showers have two drains but i refuse to believe it is actually specifically because of people being drunk in the shower
You forgot to mention that it was in student housing
That makes it a 100 times more believable to me
imagined this was a more general thing in Finland
Thanks for the link
I couldn't help but laugh a little
Could very well have been me in my early twenties
That sounds like a bathtub  not a shower
Utah ≠ Croatia
OP was asking Croatians and surrounding nations of their experiences from the earthquake this morning
Not Americans about an earthquake days ago that was completely unrelated
His comment added nothing of discussion to the thread
My comment was a bit of a jab at that
Amsterdam was quite overcrowded the two times I've visited the city
I went there for an event both times, so it was nice to put Amsterdam on the been there done that list, but it's not a place I wanna go to, if I'm not attending something
I was supposed to go to Rotterdam this year (for Eurovision), but now I hope to go next year instead, I heard a lot of good things about Rotterdam
Please don't put us in the same box as the Swedes
Danish and Swedish
Knep: DK to f*ck, SE trick
Glas(s) DK Glass, SE ice cream
Rolig: DK calm, SE funny
Bøg/bög: DK Beech, SE gay
Dog: DK though, SE died
Bonus
Danish and Norwegian
Morgenbrød: DK bread eaten in the morning, NO male erection in the morning
Norwegian: rar (means weird, strange) and Danish: rar (means cozy, nice)
And Swedish: frukost (means breakfast) and Danish frokost (means lunch)
It can lead to funny misunderstandings
Danish and English do have some too
Words in () is the Danish translation of the English meaning
Fart : DK speed, EN flatulence (DK prut)
And: DK and, EN duck (DK og)
Patetisk/pathetic:  DK full of emotions (solemnly), EN  pityful (DK ynkelig)
Slide: DK work hard, EN glide (DK rutchebane)
Save: DK saws, EN well
Guess  (DK gem)
“Fart” in danish means speed, also we have a city called Middelfart
Another good DK vs NO one:
DK: Dåse = "Can", as in a metal can for drinks
NO: Dåse = "Pussy", no explanation needed
This difference has gotten me into an awkward situation in Norway
Do you mean Swedish
Lunch is in the Danish dictionary, but it is not used, it is frokost here too
By is more like town while landsby (country/land+town) is a village and storby (big+town) is a city
However sometimes you just use by for any of them when making conversation
Not surprisingly, in Danish "seng" used to mean the bed linnen but it changed meaning along the way
It's more surprising that dýna means mattress in Icelandic as the word is associated with dun (down)
As far as a I know, mattresses were traditionally stuffed with straw in Denmark, but perhaps wool or down was used in Iceland explaining the difference
Thanks :) I did not know that
Maybe it is because the two words sound similar
It might be the same with korv/kurv, they sound the same but means two different things (sausage/basket)
Ohh
but it can get more confusing ...
Middag can mean both lunch and dinner in Danish
In Danish there is a proverb that sounds something like this:
"Gift er noget, man tager, for ikke at blive det
Poison is something you take, not to be it (married)
Gift is both married and poison
Bolle does mean bun too in Danish
And then there is "byen" which is a specific town, but can also mean that you are going out drinking (Skal vi I byen i aften
= Wanna go out(drinking) tonight
I'm guessing korv has to do with cow sausage
Yeah
It still exists in Danish as medgift
Yeah
I misread the comment
Well - there is this sentence at the Baker: der ligger snegle og boller i vinduet
Snails are f***** in the window at the baker
I love where I live
I would move abroad (again) for family but not for work
I like it a lot, safe country, the best place to get sick or loose your job
There's a reason "love" is in Slovenia :)
I joked about moving to Norway earlier today, it has been 25 degrees all week here
Thanks
Typos are my life now
It's been pretty damn great
We've been too far north for many empires to want to conquer us, and as a result we and the other northern countries have been able to pretty much stick to ourselves
Except the fact that both of our neighbours wanted to destroy us multiple times, and both came very close to succeeding at least once
Germany in 1940, and Sweden in 1658
> I've always wondered how it's like to be able to just casually go there if you want to
You know how you can just casually go to the mountains when you want
It's like that, but wetter
Very accurate
Germany has definitely been the main threat throughout Danish history as we share a border with them
First as Saxons, then as part of the Frankish Empire, then the East-Frankish Kingdom, then the Holy Roman Empire, then mainly Prussia and finally in the 2 world wars
1500 years of "Poke the Germans, poke the Germans, oh my god they're coming
Even then, of all the cardinal directions, north is definitely the one Germany has pursued the least
Constant warring with France to the west, Poland/whoever happens to rule Poland to the east and the whole papal situation to the south
Yet Germany didn't start becoming an active threat to Denmark until after unification, which means that until the 19th century, our primary concern was always Sweden
Dude we had Norway for centuries, but those bloody Swedes took them away
But I do feel grateful when i hear stories about hurricanes, earthquakes and tsunamis, that we don't get that stuff here
Depends on the year
Gulf stream + coastal climate
Yeah, Greece is literally the world's leading nation in shipping, with more trade vessels than any other nation
And that's not proportional, it's in raw tonnage
Which is why I'm reeeeally not looking forward to the mosquitoes this summer
Already seen a few swarming about
I don't even know what "it's worth it" is supposed to mean
Anatolia has historically been the place that got rolled over, whenever the balance of power shifted within a 400 km radius
Rise of the Persian empire - Anatolia gets rolled over
Greco-Persian wars - Anatolia gets rolled over
Alexander the great
Rolled over
Rome
Rolled over
Roman-Persian wars, basically all of Byzantium vs the Turks, the 20th century conflicts
I see you're a man of culture
How fuckin dare you
After losing Skåne we still had Norway, Iceland, Slesvig-Holsten and Greenland
I would say it's not until after we lost Norway, that we became "irrelevant"
You're pretty much right about everything the only thing i will add is that we did actually win the war against Sweden to get Skåne back in the 1670s. We had it, but then Sweden got their ally France involved who told us to give it all back again
And of course we technically won the great Northern war but I agree that we were pretty clearly carried by Russia
We barely did anything and for that reason we only got Slesvig-Holsten back
Skåne stayed Swedish
Universities in Denmark are pretty equal in quality, but each specialises a bit
I would definitely say Aarhus and Copenhagen are best for life sciences, but if you want to do something life science engineering, it's worth to consider Aalborg too
Did life sciences at Aarhus myself, if you have any questions
In the last 5 years there has been a huge increase in housing, so it should be no problems getting either a dorm room or a shared apartment
All master's courses outside of profession specific ones(law, medicine, etc) are exclusively in English, and they are almost exclusively taught by the research group leaders, at least in Molecular Biology
What kind of life science are you specifically looking for
Job wise, it's usually a lot of service industry jobs
I know a lot of international students work in food delivery as it's flexible with hours, and you basically just have a bike to be able to work, and the fact that when you are an EU citizen, as long as you work 10 hours a week, you are entitled to the study stipend of approximately €800/mo which will most likely pay your rent and food
There's a strong and welcoming student environment for international students at the Student House close to campus, which hosts a lot of parties, but also runs a cafe and a bar every day of the week
A few that I've heard other people use as well:
"Lægge en dej" = "Drop a dough"
"Tømme ryggen" = "Empty the back"
"At puste grise"
To blow pigs, I don't really get why
Some years ago a Christmas calendar tv show called The Julekalender, popularised a lot of phrases one of which was said by the main character Oluf Sand
He used to say:
"Jeg går ud og puster grise op
" which translate directly into "I'm going to blow up pigs
Blow up like air in a balloon, not like a bridge with explosives
Blow up pigs (puste grise op) is the funniest I think
Another classic is "empty your back" (tømme ryggen)
"Lægge en arm" = "Drop an arm" is related and terrible
Slå en streg
"beat a stick" for having a piss
Let's not forget:
"Puste grise op" = "inflate pigs
" 90's slang
don't ask
"Sende Bruno til svømning" = "Send Bruno to his swimming lessons". Bruno is a Danish boys name, very close in pronunciation to "brun" which is Danish for the color brown
In this context, "slå" doesn't mean "beat", but something along the line of "draw". Like in "slå korsets tegn" - you don't beat the sign of the cross, you draw the sign of the cross
Don't fear my accuracy, I am a benign pisser
You seem fun
Well we can easily agree racism=bad, but to get mad and complaining over a way of saying "taking a shit" seems like a bit of a Karen move
Sry i have humour and the people in my culture can take a joke
which part or joke dont u understand
U rly fit the stereotypical 0humor german
I’ve only seen a few Ladas in my country
Generally because we don’t need it to survive harsh winters
In Denmark, we are more interested in 2008-2020 cars, and the newer ones didn’t really reach Denmark
I have seen Greeks often cross the road while they have red sign, I feel almost compelled to stop every time I see the red man
Do they use am and pm in Spain

When I lived in the UK for an exchange they showed us that campaign at sixth form - they also showed another one with a group of girls, where baby dies
I still think about it every couple of months, made me absolutely terrified
It's illegal not to wear a seatbelt in Denmark
I guess there's a reason Denmark is one of the safest countries in the world
When people from the US mention staying out until 6 am like it's a wild and crazy thing to do, I always chuckle a little
The standard closing time for bars and clubs is 5 am, here
During the week it may be earlier, like 2 am, but Friday and Saturday night opening hours are usually 11 pm - 5 am for clubs
Bars can be anything from 11 am - 5 am, with some "after hours" places open from 1 am to like, 9 or 10 am
In Scandinavia (at least Denmark) if you invite someone over for dinner it’s expected that the host makes the food
In Denmark you havde food for your guests, unless you explicitly tell them, that they bring their own
The one that starts at around 5 minutes is the one that got to me, I honestly still think about it 10 years after having watched it at sixth form:
6 pm
I can barely see a thing when I go home at 4
> daylight
wozzat
Sorry for introducing it to you then - the dead baby is what really got me back then (and still)
You guys a brutal with those commercials, no punches pulled
Yeah here the normal time is between 18-19, but it can be extended to as early as 17 or as late as 20 depending on circumstance
I would never eat dinner after 21, though - that's crazy late
I mean many of the H.C. Andersen stories are quite grim when it comes to the originals
We still read them for kids though - it's a common baptism gift to give the 'child' the completed set of the stories
Also, I guess, the Norse Myth stories
Growing up the most popular comic was an illustrated version of the myths for children called "Valhalla" by Peter Madsen
I clearly remember it had stories about Odin trying to cheat Freja into sleeping with him, people getting killed and torn apart, all the stuff the original myths had
My international friends also look at me weirdly whenever I mention any of the folktales my parents used to tell me
Like [Nøkken] [Mosekonen] or [Nisser] The only that ever gave me nightmares though, was [Trolderik] He used to scare me a lot and he would swear during his show (like calling his grandmother "en gammel sur kælling" which kinda means "an old angry bitch"), which scared me even more
Also sometimes he would show up in malls and stuff and seeing that character as a two-meter tall person, is terrifying
Most likely every single story from Hans Christian Andersen
I forever associate Black Peter (Sorteper in Danish) with a black tomcat, because the card game had figures of cute animal couples on them and a lone tomcat as Black Peter
I think [this] is the set I played with
I feel like Putin would beat up a lot of people
He was in the KGB after all
From Denmark where “frokost” is lunch
In Sweden “frukost” is breakfast, that caused a few confusions
Also when I lived in London I had to get used to that “half nine” would mean “half past nine”, where the danish equivalent of “half nine” (halv ni) is half past eight
In Denmark most people consider a 40 minutes car ride 'far away'
In Danish we distinguish between them as well
Krydret(literally spicy) is with any kind of spice, while "stærkt"(Strong) is reserved for chili
I live in a different city than the village I grew up in, there is 17 km between my current appartment and my childhood home
You can travel from the tip of Denmark to copenhagen in about 5-6 hours
I love my country and feel very much at home, I think i would fit in just as well in norway tho
I have a friend from Boznia & Herzegovina who feels the exact way too
He says that visiting his family in Boznia & Herzegovina makes it a lot better, but he doesn't really feel at home here in Denmark
That's how I feel as well
I used to have dreams about moving, sort of "Grass is always greener" type stuff but the more I've learned about Denmark and about other places, the more I've come to realize that I really prefer living here
I can always go visit those other places with different nature, different culture, different food, different history etc
if I want a new experience
I'm sure I'd feel the same way if I was from most other countries so it's got nothing in particular to do with Denmark, it has to do with what I'm used to, what I've grown up with, the values I've grown up with and have adopted etc
I suppose it might be fun trying to live somewhere else (at least for a while) if I won some big lottery, inherited a fortune or whatever so I didn't have to worry about finding a job etc
in the new country, and could just spend my time checking out the things that country has to offer but that seems unlikely to ever happen
Oh dang, my Dear, sweet, half cousin twice removed and all such things
I don't know haha :D only been to sweden once, and my main memory from that is getting a horrible, horrible food poisoning from my first and last time having sushi, ever
Been to norway multiple times and love it
But, you are our slightly retarded brother, so i cant really say no to you
I think it's just too easy to "blame us" though
Plenty of immigrants from various places "fit in" perfectly fine and it's the ones who actually integrate
It's hardly surprising that people who don't integrate into their new country will have a harder time "feeling at home" there than others
I went to school with a Polish guy for example, and he was no different from us Danes at all, besides him having a Polish name and his parents having an accent
He played football with us Danes, he went drinking with us Danes, he invited people over for his birthday like us Danes, he hated school and homework like us Danes etc
etc
So he was included in everything he wanted to be included in
My sister dated a Dane from an Iranian background at one point, and when he talked about his parents it was very much about a "When in Rome
" mentality
They'd still celebrate some traditional Muslim holidays and stuff but they had basically become "culturally Muslim" and nothing more after arriving in Denmark, and his parents insisted that it was the only way they'd ever really fit in and "become Danish". His parents also made sure that he and his siblings were around other Danes, they didn't want to live in a "ghetto" or "bubble" etc
If it hadn't been for his Iranian name and slightly darker skin tone, you'd never have known he wasn't just another Dane
His mentality was Danish, his eating habits were Danish, his humor was Danish, he didn't care about religion in more than a cultural sense, he'd drink alcohol with us etc
and was just generally a really cool guy
On the other hand I've also met people who don't integrate at all
They actively cling onto their own culture, own norms, own views, own values etc
etc
and that obviously leads to way more problems "feeling at home" in a new country
It doesn't just go for people from Muslim countries although they're probably the majority of that group today, I've also experienced the same with East Asians for example
If they stick to the East Asian way of parenting, of behaving etc
obviously they'll always "stick out" among Danes
Danes don't have to whole "save face" mentality for example, or the "protecting the family's honor" type mentality, so Danes will happily laugh at themselves, they'll happily tease each other etc
as there's simply no concept of it "being insulting" or whatever
It's just seen as fun and nothing else, and both parties know that
You simply can't cling onto a completely foreign culture, mentality, set of values, behaviors etc
in a new country and then blame everyone around you for not accepting you as one of them
You chose not to be
Danes, Norwegians or whatever don't wanna have to walk on eggshells around their friends because one of them is completely different, doesn't share much of anything with them, is offended by their humor, their drinking etc
etc
Friends are generally those people you like to hang out with because you have a lot in common, enjoy the same things and so on, so if someone is completely different, it's no wonder that friendships don't really work
That's not a Nordic thing though, that's a human thing
Just reverse the roles and imagine you sticking to Norwegian culture, traditions, values, humor, drinking etc
in Iran for example
Or hell, even just here in Europe
If you don't integrate you'll always be "The Norwegian" to the people around you in another country
It's one thing to cling onto your culture, social norms etc
if you're a refugees who's going back to your own country as soon as possible, but if you plan on staying in the new country you're going to have to integrate and "become Norwegian" (or wherever you are) if you want yourself and your kids to have the best chance in life, to feel at home, to have local friends etc
Everyone does it, abselutely everywhere from the most remote village to copenhagen
Most people drink to get drunk or just for fun even if they dont get drunk
In Denmark we start way earlier .. not sure I should be proud of that
Snaps is a ceremonial thing at best
You drink at certain occations, but you wouldn't see people go into a bar and order two beers and two snaps on a normal saturday evening
Maybe not on a saturday evening
But it's not uncommon among the older generation to have øl and a snaps (øl med sidevogn) for lunch or after work at a pub
In Scandinavia it is not made from fruit, usually grain
Also usually infused with herbs and other stuff
It's also common for people to flavour their own snaps using herbs, nuts, berries
Systembolaget is 20+ no
Recently went there and had no problem buying while I was only 20
"Landevejs riddere" (Knights of the country roads)  A a type of vagabond lifestyle
It was a complete with its own culture and traditions
Where people lived their entire lives on the open road, often bringing all their worldly possessions in a  baby carriage, or decorated cart
Covered in medals, having a raccons/fox tail in their hats and accompanied by a faithful dog
Doing odd jobs, sharpening knives for people as "skærsliber" (translates to  cutting-grinder) or earning some money by singing and playing the harmonica as a "gårdsanger" (Tanslates to something like backyard singer)
[Example]
They have been around for a long time, but i think they are similar to your Luffare's.
I've never seen anything like it here
I know there was a case some years ago where a bus company (public transportation) refused a pentecoastal church add space on their busses
The second billboard references the Bible as evidence lol
Its like saying mermaids are real because the fairytale The Little Mermaid is about mermaids
Not in Denmark, that's for sure
Billboards are not allowed most places and religious signs of any kind would be very weird any other place than at church
Never seen it in Denmark nor anywhere else I've been in Europe
All those religious groups that were hunted around Europe for their extremism went to America to avoid it
It is absolutely no wonder course the US became weirdly religious
Reminds me of that giant statue of Jesus with a crown Poland build in the middle of nowhere
Also in Denmark billboards along roads are illegal for the most part, and most conservative religious people (except Jehovah's witnesses) aren't really a part of the public scene
I think they realise that blatant advertisement like that would backfire and create negative feelings towards them
Nobody wants to hear or see these bible thumping maniacs, and luckily we only have few I Denmark
If mermaids aren't real, then why is there a statue of one right in the capital, huh
Taking the statue all the way to Shanghai for an expo was a diplomatic mission on behalf of Aquatic Danes
The official tourist board wouldn't *lie* to visitors and taunt them by having a mermaid as their logo, come on
Shit, you got me
Scandinavian languages (Danish, Norwegian, Swedish), but not all Nordic languages like Icelandic and Finnish or local languages like Faroese and Greenlandic
Norwegian uses a lot of the same words as Danish, and I’m often told by people from other countries that they cannot tell them apart from each other
Swedish is also close to Danish but to a lesser extent, so it can be a little more difficult to read
(I should add that even some Danish people can’t tell written Danish and Norwegian apart, instead thinking it is just Danish with some grammar mistakes or typos)
Norweigian text was literally the same as Danish until some time in the last century
And it’s still very easy to read (Bokmål)
They just changed the spelling so it looks like it was written by a child who can’t spell right, nevertheless it actually makes sense to write it like that
Examples: Nation = Nasjon
Centrum = Sentrum
Service = Sørvis
Nynorsk is more difficult
Swedish is different but still easy enough to understand
Faerose and Icelandic is more special, if I were to read a news article I could probably understand the basic topic
If I had to go on I’d say it’s possible to make out some of the words reading Dutch or German, even if you don’t know the languages
For me I find it easy to understand Norwegian Bokmål and to a lesser extent Swedish and Dutch
Swedish
And Norwegian written is just Danish so yeah
Norwwegian, and most of the time Swedish
Sometimes we get surprised by the amount of Dutch we understand when reading
Swedish and Norwegian
It's not that a lot of people can't understand those languages spoken, but it's much easier written
German is a close second for many
From Denmark: Swedish and Norwegian is pretty easy to read
Norwegian is also somewhat understandable verbally, but Swedish (and Sweden) straight up sucks
Norwegian
It's often said in Denmark, that Norwegian is Danish, but you type how the word actually sounds
Depending on the dialect, no
If it's "Standard Norwegian" or Scanian, it's not too hard for me to understand it, since those are the dialects (probably) most similar to Danish, but the farther away it is from those, the harder it gets
Though, now we're at it, I'd like to address that, no, Danes don't inherently understand Norwegian and Swedish better than Norwegians and Swedes understand Danish, as some people seem to think
My theory is that watching Swedish TV used to be much more common here in the past because of the limited amount of channels (My parents told me that all the kids used to watch Swedish TV all the time, at least), so they got more acquainted with the language (which in pronunciation is closer to Norwegian than it is to Danish, helping with that as well) thereby starting the myth that we do
Danish has two systems for comma placement, one of which make no sense, but both are used leading to some confusion from time to time
No, bokmål is way closer to danish
If I read bokmål out loud i can pronounce almost everything in danish, where as nynorsk could be russian for that matter
Young people are very fast to switch to English instead of trying to understand
We're as conservative and change averse with grammar and spelling as we've been idgaf with pronunciation, it's an odd combo
Our comma was botched completely when the slight modernization that was attempted caused a backlash so now we have two official commas: one archaic and comma heavy, and one slightly less so
I gave up in high school and now just put commas where the lack of one impedes reading or comprehension
When I went to Göteborg I tried to speak danish and understand their Swedish but I just couldn’t understand them so I switched to English
The one guy I talked to seemed to understand me, I just couldn’t understand him for some reason, maybe they have a weird dialect in Göteborg
Denmark's true traditional national fast food has got to be the classic [Danish Hot Dog] Especially good when purchased from a [pølsevogn ("Sausage wagon")] and enjoyed on a cold winter day with a warm [Cocio Chocolate Milk
French hot dogs
Anything with Remoulade tbh
99% korrekt
Cocio skal være koldt
With vinegar, mind
Not a grilled hot dog with everything
I guess it could go either way
It could, probably
But the french ones are more exclusive to Denmark
Pretty much every single household has a flag in Denmark
In fact, it's pretty odd to not have one
We have official flag days, where most people hang their flags
We hang out our flag when someone in the household has their birthday
We set the flag halfway on the flagpole when somebody dies, and hoist it to the top after they've been buried
It's considered bad luck to have your flag out after sunset, because at that point, you're celebrating the devil
For more casual use, most Danes have a "vimpel", which is the Danish flag, but shaped like a very long triangle
You can hang these all year round, even at night
Also, on Danish birthdays in general, there are Danish flags everywhere
On the yard, in the house on the cake, et cetera
We really do like our flag
> displaying it for no reason is kinda strange
This is the main difference between Sweden and Denmark
We display the flag at all times, for any and for no reason
Birthday party
Flag
Greeting people at the airport
Flag
Cake
Flag
The sun is shining
BIG flag
Doormat to summerhouse
Flag
Beer label
Flag
Watching football
Flag cap
Open session in Parliament
Flag
Random holiday
All busses are flying flags
That's not a joke, all busses in all of Denmark will have the Dannebrog flying high on any random holiday
I second this
Kids coming home from camp
The parents will be waving flags (only for young kids though
Older kids would be embarressed) . Picking up relatives at the airport
Don't forget your flag
Confetti on New Years
Colored paper and
yes, you guessed it
We do love our flag
HOWEVER; putting up a flag as a wall decoration in (for example) your living room is seen as very bad taste
You use the flag to celebrate or mourn, not as common room/house decoration
In short: The flag is used "at events". Any other use is just
cheap
> People who say American flag-use is excessive obviously have never been to Denmark
I have yet to see Danish flags as part of the normal, everyday interior decoration in places such as classrooms (There always at least three or four), shops/supermarkets, etc in Denmark
I also disagree a bit with comparing American and Danish flag use
Yeah we use it all the time for celebrations and decorations, but on the other hand it became a bit controversial when the speaker of the parliament tried to hang the Danish flag in the hall of parliament
We really don't like our flag being used as a political symbol not even as a patriotic one
Same, everyone in my town has one
I cannot recognise this
On all holidays
That is simply not true, which memorial days
Liberation Day maybe
Jubilees, maybe, everything to do with birthdays, definitely
Some put the flag on christmass trees, not everybody
Most of the peaople I know do not own af danish flag
They may buy som paper-ones at birthdays, yes
All in all, I do not agree with you
I’m a globalist and I have a Danish flag at my window
Why not have a flag, they’re beautiful and I can show of my patriotism with it
Actually
I have a massive danish flag hanging on my wall in my room
The speaker from the Far-Right Danish People's Party, Pia Kjærsgaard, Wanted to display was Enormous, and it did not fit in
[Officielle flagdage]
I stand by my comment
But I'm not one to tell you what to decorate your home with
Wall scrolls, Katanas, Waifu pillows
You do you
It is not seen as bad taste
I don't know where he got that idea from
In my experience, I only see flags in supermarkets during big sales, which are rarer
I mainly use Netto and Fakta though, not sure where there's constant sales going on
Yea, schools tend to have a flag pole or five outside dotted around, depending on their size
I have yet to see it follow me much inside though, except for themed days or graduations
I’ve seen them a lot in the suburbs, e.g Stavtrup (Aarhus)
Very common there
I'm not sure that makes it a whole lot better
The American private use of the flag feels very political/patriotic and not simply because it's *hyggeligt*.
But that does not mean that everybody flags on the official days
Most Danes do not have a flagpole or do the slightest form of waving a flag - Big or small - on those days
Why if it’s ok I ask
Waifu pillows
Man of culture I see
It helps that our flag is Christmas-coloured
If you don't have a flag pole then no, you don't see people standing by the road waving flags unless the Queen drives by
You can't help but to notice the flags on officiel buildings on flag days
You say "most danes" but it seems to be that you're the odd one out in this discussion
I must ask what part of Denmark are you from
The patriotic use of the flag in the US feels to me as a political statement as oppose to use it simply because it's nice (hyggeligt) as in the Danish way
Grew up in Saeby, live in Aarhus
You can't really be an internationalist without the nations
Without nations you would be more like a globalist or regionalist
Thanks for explaining
>Would immigrants fly the flags of their birth country
It's not necessarily legal to fly foreign flags
And that's even his country's fault
>I believe it reproduces similar ideological lines as the American use
´What non-hyggeligt use of Dannebrog similar to the US do you see
Yup and that is exactly where I and Drahy disagree
>Unity across national boundaries
Yes, you can't have unity or cooperation between nations without the actual nations
You can fly flags from the Nordics without permission
But with other foreign state flags you would need to fly Dannebrog next to the foreign flag to obtain a permission
An exception can be made if you only have one flag pole
Yes, but we are talking about the use of it
In private use, Dannebog is used as a symbol of private celebration
That is different from the patriotic use of Stars and Stripes in the US
If you take away the symbolism of nations you don't really have nations left
They would be more like administrative regions and thus no more inter*nationalism*.
Foreign state flags on flag poles in front of houses
If you succeed in removing the nations and are left with regions, would internationalism then change meaning to the restoration of nations in your opinion
I mean in a world without nations but only regions united globally, you could hardly claim to be international anymore
[This picture] went the rounds in Denmark back in 2015
It was at the height of the migrant crisis and groups of migrants were quite literally wandering on the highways
I can't remember all the details, but a cop decided to play with a little girl during one police holdup
If it is more historical I guess it would be one of the many, many pictures of [King Christian 10
riding his horse] through Copenhagen during the nazi occupation
The first one i thought of was [Christian 10
crossing the border] into Sønderjylland after the referendum to reunite with Denmark
We lost the war in 1864 to the Prussians and they took all of Holstein and Schleswig including Sønderjylland/Northern Schleswig despite it being majority Danish
After WWI the entente offered Denmark to revise the Danish-German border, however instead of just taking all of it back, the Danish government decided to let the people vote for which country they would belong to leading to the modern day border
[Here's the border from 1864-1920, if you're interested
That the country is a bit too small in size and population
It seems like you need minimum a 8-10 million population to make yourself heard in Europe so to speak
It's actually kinda annoying
It perhaps sounds like a meme, but the corona crises has also shown the downside of the old Danish parts currently being Swedish with the Øresund being closed
It's basically just a wide "river" in Copenhagen today, but now people working in the city are turned away, when they try to go back to their homes in Malmø, because the border control doesn't accept their residential documentation
Even transit through Scania to the island of Bornholm was closed, meaning that Danish citizens couldn't travel from one point in Denmark to another, unless they took a plane or ferry, which were overbooked
Making new friends here is very hard - just ask any expat working here
Many people stick with the same small group of friends they grew up with, or met while studying
If you don't have such a group, you are fucked
How hard it is to get mental health support if you aren't insanely lucky or have a lot of money
My friend has PTSD and anxiety among a handful of other disorders but can't get a therapist
It's also incredibly expensive to get diagnosed for mental disorders like ADHD if you don't wanna wait five years
How little help you can get if you have an unspecified illness
Been trying to figure out what’s wrong with me for almost 5 years now, and no doctor or specialist can figure out what it is, and it’s keeping me from completing my education/getting a full time job, but I also can’t get government support as I would have to “work” a full time job in order to get any kind of money - which I unfortunately can’t do atm
I was told that getting medically exempt is only really viable if I have a diagnosed illness, but as no one has been able to figure out what’s wrong I’m stuck in a limbo
This isn’t really unique to me either apparently, and it really sucks
This
It is only thing I always find painful when travelling in Germany
The lack of cashless payment is astounding
I remember having to go to an atm to exchange, then having to pay for something in cafe in order to get small 0,50c exchange to go to the toilet
How's the Swiss work mentality
Any difference between boomers and zoomers
I was so lucky to get an amazing therapist "quickly", which was a like six months wait
Can agree on that
5 years waiting time is
ridculous to say the least
I waited 5 years and I am royally fucked in comparison to when we first tried to see if I could get help
Out of curiosity could you explain the behavior
Would be nice with a little more context
Which word for them can I use safely around them or others, and which one will get people pissed at me
Outside of NI troubles, bad American tech companies and tax heaven, Ireland is rarely mentioned here, and it's not really portrayed as a country, you need to take seriously in politics, unlike countries like Holland and Austria
You could of course argue the same about Belgium, but they have a good football team
In what way is Denmark portrayed in Ireland as anything other than a small country
Is Sweden portrayed differently
My parents got a private therapist but I honestly think my friend deserves one way more than me
It is but there's often a long waiting list and is not prioitized
I think it’s just a very unfortunate side effect of anything that is implemented on a large scale - some people fall through the cracks
I really hope things work out for you, and that issues like these will be ironed out in the (not too distant) future
Well our healthcare is generally fine - but only if they’re able to figure out what’s actually wrong, then the care and economic support you get is decent (cancer for instance)
The trouble is when they don’t know what’s wrong, cause then I guess it’s difficult to make a treatment plan and therefore makes it more difficult to get work exemptions when applying for benefits
Not sure if that’s how it works for everyone, but that’s my experience at least
Not a priority and an extremely long waiting list causes it from what I know
Bad tech companies as in how they exploit Europeans personal information and don't pay tax of their profits
>The whole world celebrates our national holiday
I've only heard that they colour a river green in a city in the US
>that can’t be said for any other European nation
Well, Denmark doesn't even have a national day, lol
>Irish politicians have held numerous top jobs in the EU
When was that
At least Denmark currently has Margrethe Vestager (Executive Vice-President), but despite her popularity in the EU system, she was not chosen as president of the commission, which again was taking as a sign, how Denmark was too small put any weight behind her
Yes, it strikes me a lot at random times
Also reminds me how fortunate we are for living right in this tiny pocket of time
and also how fragile peace is
When I was 6 I had memories of Barney, when my aunt uncle were 6 they had memories of German soldiers patrolling the streets
Their beaches were filled  bunkers, cannons, mines and machine guns, my beach was with sand castles and ice cream
Most of us have heard stories from the war from our loved ones (mostly granparents)
It makes you appreciate peace and hopefully be less ready to participate in wars outside of Europe too
Not really
We were neutral during WW1, and barely fought in WW2
I've also heard western Denmark being referred to as "the whipped cream front" because it was so peaceful
Out west we have some German infrastructure, mostly bunkers, a couple if cannons, and some special roads made if large blocks
So we don't really have any memories of the fighting, just from the, after Nazi standards, very peaceful occupation
A barrel of land is 5516 m² and is the amount of land you can sow with a barrel of grain
It is still used by farmers
In danish one barrel of land
It was traditionally the amount of farmland that you could sow with 1 barrel of seeds
It is still used to describe the size of farms, but I think it has changed to something more exact
There are [many] , but they were mostly used before the metric system
Like a dozen (which is 12 pieces) , we also have a *snes* which is 20
The area of old farms are often measured in *tønder* (barrels)
It’s traditionally the area which one barrel of seeds would cover
It’s approximately 0,55 hectares
Also *alen* (ell) I’ve heard before but it’s not used anymore
It’s the length of a forearm and hand
0,63 m.
Those are the only ones I’ve heard in use
Maybe because a Danish mile was ~7
5km and not as easily adapted to metric as your ~10
5km mile
Not an official measurement, but realtors often use "stenkast" (a stone throw) when they want to imply that a house is close to something positive like the beach or something like that
But when actually measuring the lengths of the realtors "stone throws", the average length have increased from 153 meters in 2010 to 239 meters in 2012
The longest "stone throw" was 943 meters according to the journalist who did the check on the realtors adds
What are you talking about
Denmark is [at least 2000km] from one end to the other
Not really, but a trebuchet is mandatory equipment when appraising a house
Grenen in Denmark
You can see two seas meet, with the naked eye
A lot of churches out there are absolutely stunning, when I come to a new village I almost always look inside the church
In Denmark I live the church in Marstal, since it is a fishing village, they have many beautiful homemade small ships hanging in the church, it is wonderful :)
dude wtf
Then why on Earth did he want to include it on a list called “the 7 WONDERS of Europe”?!
The Danish language
I totally bought into the “Romance languages are pretty, Germanic languages are ugly” stereotype
Plus Danish is constantly mocked by other Scandinavians
Now I really appreciate all languages for what they each individually have to offer
Rugbrød (proper dark rye bread) Used to hate being forced to eat it as a kid, now I long for it when I travel outside of the Nordics
It just fills you up in a way other food doesn't.
Same
My parents always wanted us to bike everywhere when I was growing up, but I've really come to enjoy it
And definitely also what it means for our infrastructure
Pret a Manger, definitely
As far as I know, we only have one located in CPH Airport
None, I prefer actual restaurants or cafes with real food
MAX Avocado Burger is the best fastfood I've ever had
We have them in Denmark, but they're insanly expensive
We just got KFC, suck it Norway
I didn't imagine anyone would mention Nadias
I would send you one sandwich if I could
avocado
and not really good anyway
I went there once for the novelty, and then again because the kids wanted to try it too
We're not coming back anytime soon
(TBF we eat fast food *maybe* twice per year, so it's not really a "I'll take my business elsewhere" but more of a "I kinda expected something more")
No no no no
It means the chickens were vegan
Never heard that here, most of the people I know use Hotmail
No, we use "e-mail" in casual conversation
I think it also has to do with the fact, that g-mail refers to one company, while e-mail is a general term
We just call it mail where I’m from
Which confuses a lot of Americans when I live in USA for a while
Danish word for traditional mail, like the physical form, is post
So people still call it email, but most people just say mail
However, most people assume you use Gmail
I made my hotmail to play a browser game
Still use it as my main mail
I just used three random letters and the shortest domain
So my email is something like abc@live
So fast to type
Sweden, Norway, Germany, England/Great Britain, then probably Iceland
Denmark:
- Sweden
- Norway
- Germany
- Greenland
- England
Edit: if you don't count Greenland then probably Iceland
*Laughs in kalmar union* just about all of the nordic countries except finland as they have all been part of denmark at some point
I would put Greenland before either England or Iceland
I just finished my master's in history, and there is a lot of focus on Greenland through the Danish history modules
Denmark is missing
Technically Greenland can't be on the list, since it is an autonomous region, not an independent country
Greenland and the Faroese aren't separate countries
It's like a Brit chosing Wales
>Various chunks of Germany (and German Poland) were Swedish for centuries
Various chunks of Germany were Danish for a millennia
Fair enough, if those are the criteria we set, then I agree
I hardly covered it in the modules on Danish history, we only had about Danelaw with Denmark for less than one hour during the bachelors and not at all during the masters  and in all of my history books about Danish history, its barely a footnote
Greenland, however, was basically covered repeatedly throughout all the modules - we have more shared history with Greenland, and I would say our time as a colonist/occupying nation all the way from 1242 / 1814 to 1979 / 2009 is pretty damn relevant in danish history
And that's not even counting the danification process, the Greenland treaty during WW2, Thule Air Base or all the shared history and culture through rigsfællesskabet
I mean several Brits on this thread did do that within the Kingdom, which is why I assumed it fell under the accepted criteria
But, if you want to make a list that doesn't count countries within the kingdom, then I agree
>This is a very dark time in our history that we feel Danes know very little about
It actually feels like it's other way round
The monopoly trade on Iceland was not particular lucrative as the point of it was to keep prices low and under market value, so the very poor population on Iceland still could afford it, even though things like grain became very expensive on the free market
The monopoly trade got a bad reputation, because the merchants appointed to ship grain to Iceland would sometimes send the worst grain, which couldn't be sold normally, as they only got a fixed and low price for it on Iceland
I suppose, but even then, England had a history with Wales before the latter was conquered
Denmark, however, has no history with Greenland prior to owning it
The Icelanders settled it, and the Danish kings claimed it before we ever went there
We're on to you
It was mostly France, that prevented us from getting Scania back, though
After France, we would first have to take care of England, Prussia/Germany, Russia before it's your time
Well that's a bit murky, since they are landlocked and weren't really countries for most of that shared history
There was certainly a clear distinction between the several tribes in Wales and several tribes in England all the way from Roman time, but at that point there wasn't really a "Wales" or an "England", so it isn't shared history between two different countries but that shared history between several tribes within the same landarea
One could argue that they share history as seperate countries in the early middleages, but even then its shared history between the English, and then Welsh and Viking tribes
Wales didn't become a country until 1056, and by 1282 they were under English rule
Meaning there's really just shared history between the countries of Wales and England for less than 240 years, which is basically a blink of an eye in terms of history that far back
That being said, all of this boils down to semantics
Like I said, I agree that if we are talking autonomous country only, then Greenland shouldn't be on the list
>This revisionist view of history is simply ridiculous
You are continuing the rather infamous founding myth of the Icelandic republic by Icelandic nationalists (ref
Guðmundur Hálfdanarson)
They simply needed an exterior "enemy" to create a nation
There's no documentation for the people on Iceland being heavily taxed, and the tithe to the Church was not transferred from Iceland to Copenhagen
Iceland was hit by one disaster after the other in those times, and the population on Iceland was decimated and very poor
There was simply nothing of value on Iceland, and they could barely support living there
At the same time the market price of things like grain skyrocketed, so without appointing merchants to ship grain there, they would have no reason to do so
So like it or not, the trade monopoly was a necessity, or at least viewed as such at the time, to ensure people could continue their existence on Iceland
But the trade monopoly also helped to hold the Danish realm better together and to keep the English and Dutch out of Danish waters around Iceland
In the later periods of trade monopolies, when the existence of people living in remote places like Iceland was no longer threatened, it also became clear that a more free economy was a better way to develop the societies and enable growth
No, France was a Swedish ally, but still decided the peace treaties at the time, and Denmark was every time not allowed to keep Scania or at least the places under Danish control
At least you Dutch guys didn't want the Swedish to take both sides of Øresund either
Without any warning, in defiance of international treaty, the Swedish king ordered his troops to attack Denmark-Norway a second time
There followed an attack on the capital Copenhagen, whose residents successfully defended themselves with help from the Dutch,  who honored their 1649 treaty to defend Denmark against unprovoked  invasion by sending an expeditionary fleet and army, defeating the Swedish fleet in the [Battle of the Sound] and relieving the capital
Denmark held Gotland, Helsingborg and Landskrona as well as most of Swedish Pomerania together with the Brandenburgers after the Scanian War
But the French king refused Denmark to keep anything and wanted the Treaty of Roskilde restored
When Denmark and the Brandenburgers opposed it, he moved his army all the way up to Oldenborg and forced Denmark and the Brandenburges to accept his terms
Again after the Great Nordic War, France and Great Britain refused to let Denmark control Øresund again
And csgo and overwatch and all fucking mobile/browser games that use gambling mechanics
Bold of you to assume there's even going to be any sort of human populace in 100 years ;)
Autonomic cars might make that a reality
Instead of being stuck in inner city trafic, you can just work while your car drives you from a rural place to the city
> No flying cars
The movies were wrong
I hope for this, as the only paths toward international influence
baltic, benelux and nordic powerbloc unions within the EU
The nordic countries have a high standard on working conditions, unionisation etc
The EU is trying to drag us down to the lower standard of eg
Romania as we speak
the pro-EU nordic socialist are here too
We can easily be organised and stand in unity without being a federal entity
Well the EU-wide minimum wage is the most recent thing they are trying to get through
It would totally decimate our labour market and high wages
Free movement of labour has also led to social dumping because people come here to work without unionising and working at places that don't have collective agreements, further destroying our scandinavian model
Languages need a state to survive
It's simple as that
but I am a federalist, just a social-democratic one
Well the Scandinavian model could work everywhere else, you just have to get people unionising
No reason you couldn't do that in Romania for example, but just know that it is a long and hard struggle against the people that profit off of having low wages and benefits
It's a class struggle really
We don't have a minimum wage at all in Scandinavia because we set the wages by sector according to the agreements that happen between the workers unions and the business unions
If the EU mandate a minimum wage, even a relatively high one, the wages will stagnate and the incentive to join a workers union become smaller while the business unions can always point to the minimum wage whenever there is a negotiation (every 2 years)
Every country that has put in a minimum wage has working poor
Furthermore the EU almost always either take the side of the business interests or the southern or eastern EU countries that have a lower standard than us
No, on the contrary there were EU regulations introduced in the 00's that make mandatory unionisation illegal
It used to be mandatory when you entered certain sectors that you had to join the corresponding union, but not anymore
But because the unions are almost universally seen as a positive we still retain 70% unionisation of the workforce
Our point of view is that it is the "low standard" countries that should start experimenting and push for more fair and democratic work and wage regulations, as you are the ones that are unhappy about the status quo
I think they should implement the minimum wage in the countries like yours where it is actually needed
Pushing it on us will only destroy our opinion of the EU
We usually use templates of old children programmes
Quite funny
For example, Kaj & Andrea
There's a few
This is probably the most used one: ["Egon Olsen template"]
A popular "reference meme" would be this [Træls i gennem en længere periode] It translates roughly as "Annoying for a long time".. The guy with the beanie is being interviewed about a killing another person and in the interview he shows very little remorse and said the reason for killing the other guy was because "He had been annoying for a long time period". This video already became quite known when it came out, but it really took off in around 2015-2016 when the daughter of the guy who was killed goes on TV to tell that she finds the video annoying but that just ended up boosting the popularity of the video even more
Otherwise many Danish memes are about Sweden and use different maps of Sweden or the Swedish flag as a template
Both r/Denmark and r/sweden have off-spring subreddit where most posts are about mocking each other
r/Dankmark for Danish memes mocking Sweden and r/unket for Swedish memes mocking Denmark
Wasnt Dolan also finnish
Also, or at least from what I've seen on facebook from Swedes, you guys use Alfons Åberg a lot for memes
Det er fredag mine gutter
Also koldskål (a type of yoghurt) is for some reason a meme
There was a very popular kids show on Danish national television called [Kaj og Andrea] Kaj is a stuffed toy frog and has become the base of a lot of different Danish memes
Lol, that's Kaj, from the much loved children's tv show Kaj og Andrea
It started way back in the 70s or 80s. Kaj has just become a meme for some reason
Just curious, why are you interested in the denmark subreddit
Calling it yoghurt is a sin
It's based on buttermilk and contains egg
(Edit: spelling)
Think that's the same here with "hurtig briller"
Hurtigbriller is peak nordic unity
I would say the best friend Denmark has in terms of shared culture, language and citizens liking each other, would be Norway
The norweigians might not see ud as THE closest but we are close
Sweden
But not in a "we're super close siblings". More like "we're the siblings who always fight".
Iceland is sorta the little brother that drifted away but when you finally meet it’s like you’re best friends
It can be summed up in:
From a danish wiew, Sweden bad, Norway fine
From a Swedish wiew, Denmark bad, Norway nice
I don’t really know how it is from a norweigian wiew
The further south you get, the more fun people have
The further north you get, the more you binge drink
Kinda weird
We Danes sure binge drink as well, but it seems more common here to drink a glass of wine to dinner on a common Tuesday than it does in the rest of Scandinavia
Kinda like in Southern Europe
Or maybe it’s just because a bottle of wine in Norway costs three times what it does in DK :)
Vi er alle her
Sidder og sveder lidt over svagt ihukomne bøjninger og tilfældige gloser fra ferier sydpå. Sætter lidt for meget tillid til engelsk som bro mellem germanske og romanske sprog
I think I'll start using that in Danish (Jeg forstår kun banegård) when I don't understand anything
So, as u/bhjoellund says, it is just the equivalent of "nur".
That said, your question did make me wonder where the word *kun* comes from
Is it related to *kein*? No, it's not
In fact, it comes from a contraction, which is kind of weird
*kun* is apparently the weathered-down result of the phrase "ikke uden" (or "ække uten" as it would have properly been in Old Danish)
That literally means "not without", as in the sense of "nothing beyond (that)", e.g. *only*.
the two words "ikke" and "uden" are themselves rather unlike anything in German, but the word *uden* meaning "beyond" or "outside" is related to German *ausser*.
"kun" means "only" in Danish :)
Thanks for the thorough explanation
I had no idea that *kun* was a contraction
More than I can list
Some examples
For polterabend it's tradition for the man to be dressed in a dress and sell kisses in a public place
For the wedding there's thing's like cutting the groom's socks, the groom taking the bride's stocking of only using his theeth, the last kiss when either the groom or bride leaves the room everyone rushes up to get a last kiss, there's the banging on the tables under and over which means the bride and groom have to get on or under the table and kiss and then the guests stand up cheer, drink and sing, which is something that happens randomly during the whole day/night
In denmark if the groom goes to the toilet the men get to Kiss the bride and vice versa
Also the wedding cake
It has 3 layers each containing an item
A penny, a thimble and a key i think
The symbolize wealth, and I can’t remember what the thimble and key symbolize
Also when they leave the church together we throw Rice at them
If i remember correctly its on the mouth
I would just reinstate our old flag of a black raven on a white background
Only need to change our proportions really
Our current one is a little too complicated when a more ideal one should be 5:7 or 8:11
Have you considered making it red and white instead
I think it would look good
Maybe a nice
Red and white
>Denmark: I wouldn't change a thing
I'd standardize the Nordic flags so they have the [same ratios and same colour shades]
I would use the darker shade of red from the naval flag in the normal flag
Yes
That one
Red and white are the true scandinavian colors
Actually agree with a swede for once, not too fond of the religiøs middle eastern origin
Even though the reason the nordic flags are the way they are thanks to Valdemar Sejr king of Denmark rought back a battle es standard flag from estonia which fell from the 'heavens' after the battle later being dubbed Dannebrog
Fine, as long as the others adopt our propotions and color
Yeah it was used by viking chieftains way before Dannebrog "fell from the skies" at the battle at Lyndanisse in 1219
Quadratisch
Praktisch
Gut
I love te irony of how a German is pointing out that we got greedy for wanting a small piece of land
And people say you guys don't have a sense of humour
Yeah, or maybe the HRE copied it from us
Apparently both flags started showing up somewhere in the 1200's so getting a precise date on either is going to be tricky unless you have a time machine handy
Just red and white, simple and beautiful
> Before 1982 it was also against the law to raise the flag on "wrong" times and forget to take it down
That still somewhat counts in Denmark, though not as an actual law but more of a strictly-followed etiquette
We don't own Greenland, they're an equal member of rigsfællesskabet along with the Faroe Islands
Well you guys wanted the Soviet Union and the rest of Europe
So if wanting Slesvig-Holstein means we danes got small penises, then you guys must be a bunch of pussies, going by your own logic
Are you saying /u/Flashgit76 did, or you hit mine
Hahaha duly noted
Well right now we're doing what you're doing and letting a woman run the show, so I think we're both in the clear
For now anyway
I see
I think it depends on the family
My brothers and I pay rent but I don’t think any of my friends do
It happens, but the people who do are the outliers
I've heard about it happening maybe once or twice in my entire life - and not about anybody I personally knew
Then again, here it's uncommon to live at home after 20 years old (this is also around the time where your student support starts being affected by your parents' income)
I'd imagine if more people stayed longer, then it would happen more often
Do you mean under 18
If not, i'm 18 and i had to pay my mom rent ever since i turned 18, not very much though
I know other people who do, and some who don't, I don't think it's that common
From Denmark, It happens I payed 150 euro in my gap year while working
I also paid rent when before I moved out
(I still do, but not to my parents)
I have no idea how common it is though
Nah, it's not like they have to move out at 18
It's more about them moving out when it makes sense
If they're going off to university 50 km away for example, they'll likely want to move out instead of having to do that trip twice a day
Now obviously it depends on the family, on their wealth and things like that, but in general it's really just about what the kid is doing at the time and the kid's own desire to move out
It's usually not about the kid being "kicked out" but simply that the kid has likely been thinking about it, dreaming about the "freedom" of it etc
for a year or more already, and then when they get the opportunity they'll likely want to move out if at all possible
If you're living at home and working a full time job, you may be expected to at least pay some symbolic amount every month so you'll learn how things "in the real world" actually function
But if you're just getting by while studying they'll likely not ask you to pay
Unless they're like *really* poor (by Danish standards) perhaps
There is an expectation to be independent I'd say, you're not longer a child after all
Of course you can ask for help with something if you don't know how it works but you're expected to deal with more and more stuff on your own
Pay your own bills, do your own laundry etc
The parents are trying to teach you what you need to know when you do eventually move out
Once you're in your 20s you can start talking about an expectation to move out
Probably not because the parents want to "get rid of you" but because that's what people that age do in our countries
Now obviously there's also exceptions here as parents aren't complete idiots
If they live like next door to the university the kid goes to and he/she only has one year left, it'd be a bit silly to ask them to move out at that time
Then they'll likely wait until the kid is done at uni and then he/she can move out
Iceland: Keiko (free Willy)
Denmark: Siku (polar bear) or maybe Brutalis (rhino, died in 2000)
In Denmark, the Swan is considered our national animal/pet
Everybody always says Danish is the most beautiful language they've ever heard
We sound like we have a potato in our mouths is the most common one i've heard
I can’t count how many times I’ve heard “it sounds like you have a throat disorder” and “It sounds like you have a potato stuck in your throat”
Generally I’d say we’re being bullied by our neighbors to the north/east
As a Dane, I've always thought Dutch sounded like a weird mix of Danish, German, and English, which I personally really like the sound of
Polish to me is the snake whisperer language
I completely second this
I don't mind the Scandinavian banter, but that is 60% if the jabs we get, the other 30% being kamelåså (which doesn't even look Danish), and the remaining 10% being other things
You literally cannot talk to someone from another Scandinavian country without them doing the potato or kamelåså joke at least once
It’s getting irritating
I guess they don’t think about how often we must hear it
We get it, you think it’s ugly and weird
Could you come up with another joke now
> haven't really listened to any real German speakers talking
Oh they've definitely listened to one German speaker talking
It could also be from Kristianstad maybe
I met a guy from there with a heavy accent, it sounded more Danish than Norwegian
English isnt from germanic
Its from latin
Swedes tend to assume that we understand them more than they do us, which simply is not true
Sweden used to have more TV channels than we did back in the day, and I know a lot of people who grew up in those times watched those channels, so I'm assuming they simply understand Swedish better because they have had way more exposure to it
These days, hardly anyone watches the Swedish channels, so it makes sense that younger Danes start understanding Swedish less
Personally, unless you're from Scania, I'll have a hard time understanding Swedish
Fun
My experience with Swedish is the exact opposite
You understand me but I need subtitles for you
Kamelåså not looking Danish irritates me as well
I also saw this [sketch] apparently the entire joke of it is that it sounds like Danish
I thought they were trying to speak Norwegian or something
I am probably unreasonably salty about this, but when your language gets called ugly over and over again and you’re interested in languages, it gets to you
It makes me feel like I’m cursed with an ugly language somehow
At least “Swedes are gay” is an actual joke, obviously nobody thinks Sweden is more homosexual than other places
But a lot of people really does seem to hate Danish
Which is fair enough I guess, but still
Scanian have the throat R as well
To a degree
My parents' generation seem to have an easier time understanding people from Norway and Sweden due to them having grown up watching TV from there
My generation seem alright
We can communicate with the others with some effort without switching to English, but it's not super easy
Norwegians are usually easier to understand as we share more words with them than we do with the Swedes
I'd imagine (though I don't actually know) that Cypriots consume a lot more Greek media than the other way around which would make them more familiar with how you speak
There’s a generational divide
My parents (I’m 17) grew up with Swedish TV
You had more channels since you’re twice as big as us
So most people of that generation has a decent understanding, while ours is pretty lost
I’ve watched so much SKAM that I have a decent understanding of both, though
So, yeah, the Scandinavian languages are pretty intelligible, but it requires some practice, which not everybody has
In today’s youth it’s whether you watched SKAM or not
Sorry for the confusion
I meant Kristiansand
Oh it definitely is mumbling
Yeah i was just speculating as to why that was the case
Norway
For being a very good example of how a natural resource can be used for the public good instead of pure profit, with their national oil fund
One of the things that annoy me most about our country's modern history is the government selling the oil extraction rights for areas of the North Sea instead of doing what Norway did decades later and nationalising the resource instead
The UK for their music and tv-shows
Taskmaster is a national treasure

Yeeeeah we kinda did the small brain right there
You mean BBC
these days, david attenborough only narrates
Right back at ya svenskdjævel
Come have a beer in Cph sometime
You are like our mental challenged cousin
But you are still our cousin
Thank you for having such beautiful women
Norway will always be our little brother, imo
I thank Bulgaria for being in Golden Sands when I was 17 years old
First time I traveled alone with my buddy
It was quite an experience
Our market is more free than yours, we just have decided to have high taxes and a strong social security welfare model, but we still embrace capitaliscm
I wanna thank you for your contribution to science and also showing that you can have a succesful liberal society
In general phone adverts were pretty good
Now, they are just pure shit
Are you kidding me
Straight childhood memories> Moomin
I never lock my doors if I'm at home during the day
Generally, I remember to lock them at night or if I'm not at home, but not always, and it never bothers me if I don't tbh
Well the door can only be opened from the inside but I always lock the extra lock on the door
There are many homeless romas in my area and they often go into our courtyard to roam through our garbage if the main gate isn’t shut
Once inside the main gate it’s easy access to the apartments
I don't unless it's night, no matter what house or apartment I'm staying at / visiting / living in
Now, I don't have to at all, but I can't sleep knowing that someone could potentially just walk in and kill me at any time, even if no one will ever realistically try doing that
I have read too many creepy comment threads to not lock the door at night
During the day though
It's unlocked
Yes but only I have to because of how my door is made
Not generally no
I've only encountered one door in Denmark that locked automatically, and that was when I lived in a very shady dorm just outside of Copenhagen
Otherwise, it's not something our doors do
The same for me
I hate it when my car runs away
It is available in Denmark - I have seen it in apartments, and my parents old house had it as well
But I don't see it very often, and it's not something I would want for myself, since I imagine the kids would get locked out all the time
I only lock the door when everyone is leaving the house, or at night when we go to sleep
During the day, it's just not practical (I work from home a lot)

John gik gennem en mørk skov til et værtshus kun for at finde ud af, at han har glemt hans penge
MeToo
It’s both popular and controversial for a few reasons:
Some months ago, at an award show, a popular TV-host from our national broadcasting channel named Sofie Linde gave a speech where she revealed that a powerful colleague/boss at the channel had threatened her to *ruin her f-ing career if she didn’t suck his dick
This gave way to a rampage of sexual harassment accusations from journalists and politicians especially, essentially revealing/shedding light on the rotten culture and structural issues that “allow” powerful men to abuse their position to harass mostly younger female colleagues
Currently, there’s almost a new case in the media every day about someone revealing that he or she has been the victim of sexual harassment
Especially politicians are in the crossfire right now
It became increasingly controversial a few weeks ago when the leader of the social liberal party had to step down because a woman within the party revealed that he had grabbed her thigh 10 years ago
Many people found that completely ridiculous that he’d step down for “just that”, whilst other people found it appropriate since their party has probably been the most prominent party in the MeToo-debate
Now the mayor of Copenhagen has also stepped down because several accusations have been made about how gross he’s been towards female colleagues for over 20 years
What’s weird is that our foreign minister Jeppe Kofod had sex with a 15-year old intern (15 is legal here) and left her crying in the bedroom 12 years ago, and he hasn’t stepped down
Anyway it’s a whole shitshow, but it’s definitely a popular and controversial subject at the moment
Sexual assault, primarily amongst politicians
Two large cases were recently dug up from 10+ years ago, because who knows why
A political party-leader quit because of a 10-year-old case with him grabbing a woman on the thigh
Why has our world come to this
I was in Gothenburg two weeks ago, and it was so weird and interesting to see how differently the people are responding to COVID in Sweden vs
in Denmark
Here, the government has come down much harder with restrictions etc
which has transferred to the population and essentially made us more cautious/nervous in the public space
In Sweden, or Gothenburg at least, it seemed like people didn’t really mind being cramped up together in tight spaces, stores etc
And it was so funny to see everyone take off their masks the minute our train left Denmark and crossed the sound over to Sweden lol (masks are mandatory in public transport here)
Everyone was just so chill :)
Send snow plz
We haven't had a decent winter in flippin' YEARS
I would like to contest that a case is happening almost every day
As far as I know, there has only been three people that have been fired because of their misconduct
Frank Jensen, Morten Østergaard and Mads Danielsen
It's a huge news story in Denmark atleast
That could og course because the Muhammed drawing is from a danish newspaper
His party, the Social Democrats (who are the governing party atm), has a youth party called SDU
The SDU had some sort of seminar that took place at a boarding school (efterskole in Danish)
Jeppe Kofod participated at the seminar and at the party they threw afterwards
He then proceeded to have sex with this 15 year old who, it turns out, had been an intern with the Social Democrats only a few weeks prior
Witnesses said she was breaking down crying in the bedroom after he left, but she hasn’t pressed rape charges and he says it was consensual but that he’s sorry and that it shouldn’t have happened (obviously)
Regarding the Kofod case
It has to be mentions that it became a news item back then too, which is the reason why it's not a bigger deal now
About damn time
Hahahahaha, so true
Being from Iceland where everything went bananas during the original metoo wave
Almost nothing happened in Denmark
And now, suddenly, people are outraged
About fucking time
I see your point, but: Well first of all, there was also Orla Østerby and the unnamed guy from DR who Maria Fantino accused of asking her to have sex with his wife while he watched
And second, there are the 701 women who signed the Sofie Linde-letter, 300-something women who signed the letter saying there is sexism in the Parliament, 543 doctors and nurses who said the same thing about their field, 689 people who signed the letter saying there is sexism and harassment at the universities etc
etc
etc
Many of those women have openly revealed their experiences to the media, they just haven’t given any names
So yeah I would say there is more or less a new story somewhere in the media every day, whether or not they have led to someone being fired/stepping down is another story
Another thing: It only occurred to me a few days ago, but politicians actually cannot get fired since they are technically employed by the people
This is why the politicians in question have either stepped down due to immense pressure from the public or have had their political spokesman positions taken from them by the party
But essentially a politician can’t be fired
It makes sense, but it’s weird, right
Yup, same here during the summer
Now our government has just made it mandatory to wear masks in all public spaces and not just transport
Anyway, I hope it doesn’t get too bad in Sweden or Denmark (or anywhere else)
good good, let the hate ~~flow~~ **snow** through you
All indoor public spaces, just to clarify
Yeah it seems so
As of next Thursday to clarify even more
I think that all Universities here are seen as more or less equally prestigious
They are all free
Maybe some fields, that are hard to get in to or are viewed a harder study, are regarded higher than others
Depends on the field
For engineering fields and Computer Science, it would be Aalborg University, it is also ranked 4th in the world for those areas
For most other areas in technology it would be DTU
For business, it would be Copenhagen Business School (CBS)
For most other things, it would be Copenhagen University (KU) or Århus University (AU)
None are more prestigious than others, since they are all free
It depends heavily on what you want to study, as some fields are way more popular than others
If you talk "folkeskole", which is before high school (age 5-15/16) and high school, it's gotta be Herlufsholm, which is a private school combined with a boarding school
For students under the age of 13, one school year will cost the parents 42620 Danish crowns (6474 American dollars) while students over the age of 13 cost 53300 Danish crowns (roughly 8100 dollars)
Boarding students will cost 157000 Danish crowns (roughly 23850 dollars)
That might not sound that expensive compared to American private schools, but when you then look at the fact the average tax percentage per person in Denmark is 46%, you'll understand it's pretty expensive and prestigious
Hard to get into doesn't necessarily equate to a tougher curiculum
I study Medicine in Odense, easier to get into (I think) compared to Copenhagen (More people want to study in the capital)
But you have double as many exams in Odense
So prestige in admittance or curiculum varies
I think at most some universities have stereotypes associated with them - Like I went to RUC for example, so I've gotten a lot of "hippie jokes" throughout the years
But people have never assumed that my academic level was lower because I went there
When you are applying for jobs, which university you went to is irrelevant
People care more about what you studied
If you studied medicine at Copenhagen, nobody is going to assume you are any better than someone who studied it at Odense, even though Odense is easier to get into
Everybody knows the main reason Copenhagen is hard to get into is that it's the capital and nothing else
Plus the whole grade-average is so misleading
As far as I know, there's no university subject that has requirements for "minimum" grades you need to have - instead if 200 people apply and they only have room for 50, they just pick the 50 best
That means that if that 200 people have high grades, the grade average is high, but if they don't then it's low
It can change a lot from year to year that way
It also really depends on what you are studying
For instance, DTU has one of the largest selection of pilot plants for chemical and biochemical engineering studying(the summer usually has the hall full with foreign students coming just to run experiments there)
I tihnk the difference is Roskilde University is generally regarded as worse than the others
Other than that the difference is minor
Depends on what you study
Business
CBS
Technical stuff
DTU
Humanities
KU (University of Copenhagen
Even though, I have actually heard that Aarhus is better in the law department
I feel like university of southern Denmark is of lower tier and RUC is rock bottom
I'm a researcher in Computer Science
Most germans I see at conferences work at Max Planck Institute for Informatics
I think you're confusing prestige with leading a certain field
I think there's very little difference prestige-wise, except maybe for CBS and RUC being at the opposite ends of the scale
Precisely
For instance STEM Universities may be easier to get in to than antropology or midwife or psychology but it is based on popularity and not academic complexity
It is harder to get in to than for instance Århus, Ålborg or Odense,but that is mostly because more people want to study in Copenhagen
I don't think that people here view the other Universities as worse than Copenhagen
Also in Copenhagen we have different Universities for different fields and they are regarded as equal
In general, but if you look at certain areas it's different
For instance, Aalborg is currently ranked number 4 in the entire world for Engineering
Eh, Copenhagen and Aarhus are within 14 spaces of each other
Not that much better than Aarhus for instance
And ofc the universities are nota t the exact same rank, but I think the point is that, in spite of the difference in ranks, that doesn't translate into real prestige in Danish society
RUC is regarded as a hippy-dippy school, but I've never heard of it as being regarded as worse academically
Personally I've found that loads of employers prefer my RUC background because I'm used to big complicated projects, group work and interdisciplinary work
Personally I've gone to both KU and RUC and found that the level was about the same within the same subject, just different in teaching styles
One could argue that writing a 60+ pages dissertation each semester is harder than sitting in a classroom 8ish hours a week for the same amount of ects-points
It really just depends on the person, tbh
As a external lecturer at ITU, I think you are way off
RUC is by no means rock bottom and University of Southern Denmark has some real capacities
DTU excel in engineers, but DIKU and ITU are top Computer Science schools
Actually, the top 10 of studies, thst are the hardest to get in to, include Aarhus and Odense;
Hvis man ikke skriver Aalborg, burde man udvises
I don't mean RUC is literally worse but more it has a worse reputation
But maybe I'm exaggerating
I do know that people on r/denmark make fun of RUC almost as much as they do of people who study the humanities though, but they may not be the best source
I'm not saying ruc is trash, but if I have to compare RUC to it's peers, I think the consensus is that it is the lowest tier of em all
Yeah I forgot about ITU, i haven't really heard much from ITU, but considering the Danish IT sector is great, I think it's pretty great
University of southern Denmark as well have some capabilities, but I think AU & KU have more to offer
Linked Data / Semantic Web :)
That's a very ambitious school and very popular
I hope you have a great time
My girlfriend is a foreign student attending CBS
She says it is quiteambitious but not as great as she expected
Your mileage may vary tho
Udvises af Aalborg
Det går nok
r/ denmark is a fine enough sub to be on for fun, but they are def not the source for knowing what the general public thinks
It's widely considered that a somewhat big part of its users are objectively problematic at varying degrees (racism, bigotry, sexism, elitism or just general assholishness)
I use the sub myself, and I would never consider it the end-all-be-all for what people outside that sub thinks about anything
And the idea that humanities are somehow all "easy" subjects, which many on there seem to think, is honestly ridiculous and snobbish - and the same with RUC somehow being easy or a worse university than others
Like I said, outside of Reddit, I've never met people who honestly saw RUC as a university that "worse" or has a "bad reputation". At worst people might disagree with their teaching style or, again, associate it with the hippie movement
But it's no more than how people go: "oh so you are a douchebag" when they hear someone went to CBS
Yeah, I think you are overall right
I probably considered the "hippy" reputation and in my mind that was conflated with being a bad reputation
It really serves the general point that there are no major differences between Danish universities
I don't know the school firsthand, but I get the impression, that it is a hard school
Don't hesitate to ask, if you have questions about transferring to Denmark
> too hard
haha, yep
It's not a place you go to slack off
February is probably the worst month of the year, so pack a coat
But you will get to see beautiful spring in April and May
What I mean is: It's not a place to be if you're generally a slacker
Of course there'll be time for beers and gals/lads/entities of your preference
My High School had Erasmus students come and visit before Covid
But for the weather thing, it can get colder than that in Denmark (makes sense) but it’s usually around the -1 C to (at the coldest) -10 C in the winter and fall months
In most stadiums there are overhangs for just that, rain, so you should be good there, if it’s cold i’d dress accordingly
However, the theme-parks aren’t really the place to go to when raining
Most restaurants are indoors, so that’s good as well
Yes, a lot of the time it is cold and dark here, so you will find a lot of indoor sports and activities
Moldova, as a part of Romania, is plenty interesting
Moldova, as its own entity, completely disregarding Romanian history, has very little to write home about (literally)
Here's a thing to do in Slovakia
Drive along the E50 and count all the castles you see
You'll see more castles in a day than you'll see in years
Slovakia is amazing
Says the only flatter country ;)
I mean, if you care about the Viking age, especially in relation to England, most of that history has to do primarily with us
Denmark was actually also quite important in the early history of the Netherlands, particularly Frisia (The Danes destroyed the Frisian kingdom, which led to the absorbation of all the current Netherlands into the Frankish empire, which eventually led to the development of the Netherlands as we know them)
True, it's like Netherland, just nicer and cooler being Scandinavian/Nordic and all
Some of the [old buildings and canals] in Copenhagen have taken inspiration from the Dutch
I don't understand why tourists visit Sweden or Denmark, and I say that as a very happy Copenhagen resident who wouldn't want to live elsewhere
Coming here to study or live, sure, but a vacation destination
Norway is a beautiful country, though
Our highest point is actually lower than Netherlands' highest point, so they've even gotten us beat on that :(
Grenen is kinda cool, not often you can stand in two different seas at the same time
People generally visit Denmark *because* it's not spectacular and dramatic :D
Denmark is hygge and good things in a small package, not frost bites or dangerous animals, lol
The Vikings were from both Denmark *and* Norway (and Sweden, but shhh)
It is, however, true that the Vikings most people know about - I.e. the ones who invaded England and France - were almost entirely from Denmark
The Norwegians settled Ireland and Scotland and the north Atlantic, while the Swedes went east and founded Russia
Denmark is sandy beaches, friendly people, clean air/water, bike culture, amazing food, architecture, all hygge and no drama
At least that's why so many Germans, Norwegians, Swedes and Dutch people come here when asked why
Also about one million Americans fly to Copenhagen yearly
Actually Denmark has about the same number of foreign turist nights as Sweden and Norway combined
Copenhagen almost the same number as whole of Norway
Don’t ruin my joke with facts
>Our highest point is actually lower than Netherlands' highest point
The state of Denmark's highest point is Gunnbjørns Fjeld on Greenland, which is 3,694 m.
People are uptight in the other Nordics
Sweden maybe, but the rest seem chill to me
Not really though
You'll find ships, great halls, rune stones and ring fortresses in especially Denmark but also Norway and Sweden
But Iceland of course has the old style language and little horses
The Kievan Rus were the result of viking explorers (Varangians) from Sweden establishing chiefdoms along their trade-routs down the eastern Rivers, with Norse elites ruling over Slavic subjects
Even the name "Rus" originally referred to Swedish vikings, from an Old Norse word related to rowing
The Finnish name for Sweden, for instance, is "Ruotsi", which is probably derived from the same word
There are also several places in the part of Sweden closest to Russia that have names evidently deriving from *Rus* (or vice versa)
Russia's Norse origins have been mostly forgotten, partly because the connection stopped being renewed after the 11th century, and partly because Russian nationalism suppressed the idea that their country might have been founded by Swedes (who were, remember, historic enemies of Russia)
The first two rulers of the Kievan Rus, Rurik and Igor, both have Norse names (Rurik is from Old Norse Hrǿríkr, while Igor is a Slavic rendition of the name Ingvar
Both are mentioned in the Sagas
Uhh a swede, let’s rally against the swedes
I have also heard that, Danes were the "Italians" of Scandinavia and Swedes the "Germans". Norwegians were the "Brits" or something
Oh, I wasn't trying to convince him
I was agreeing with him :)
Denmark is officially claiming the North Pole (the EEZ)
Yeah, "Good for you
" is a funny one and it clearly also depends on the tone in English
You sometimes hear it in movies and stuff, where an American (or whatever) will say "I got a new job
" or "I got into Yale
" or whatever and the other person will say "Good for you
:D" in a genuinely nice way
"Godt for dig
" (the Danish variant) sounds sort of dismissive and sarcastic, and it'd likely be used in situations like someone bragging, or someone being upset with you
Since we generally love sarcasm in Denmark, even the sarcastic usage *can* be used in a kidding kinda way towards friends and stuff though
Yeah, "Jeg elsker dig
" also seems more "serious" and intimate than "I love you
" does in English
Americans especially (judging from books, movies, online interactions etc
) seem to use it all the time, even as a "Bye" when on the phone to family members etc
If a relative is dying in a hospital bed you might also say it suppose, and it wouldn't really be weird but that's obviously also a *very* serious situation and you may never see the person again
And then there's drunk friends of course, who knows what they might say
But if they're sober it just comes across as strange (although not rude) for a friend to tell you that he loves you
It has happened to once in my 30+ years on the planet, and I still remember the moment very clearly because it just took me by surprise and was very strange to me
I didn't really know how to react
Danish teenagers and stuff will often use "I love you
", "love you
" or whatever on their social media profiles etc
as that just seems "lighter" and a bit less serious than "Jeg elsker dig
" due to media influence
We're the least perceptibly corrupt country in the world
We still have a lot of politicians who have their own private foundations, where companies and people can donate money to get to meet and speak with the politician
So while we don't have a lot of the usual corruption seen elsewhere in the world, we do have quite a bit of "hidden" corruption
Apparently, Denmark happens to be the least corrupt country in the whole world
Granted I still believe that small instances of corruption occur on a smaller scale here
No matter what society you may inhabit, there’s bound to be at least a minuscule amount of corruption
The least corrupt in the world
The least corrupt in the world, despite several cases of breach of trust
Denmark is usually considered the least corrupt country in the world, probably because it is near impossible
Apparently one of the least corrupted countries if not the least corrupt overall, although corruption is rising and we wish there was less corruption, corruption has grown in recent years at long from what people tell me and listening to the news
[Very little]
> Ask any not-brainwashed Russian and he will tell you about that
This dynamic has always interested me
It seems like Russians fall into two categories: trusting the state and refusing to see any problem or seeing the whole system for what it is; highly corrupt
And even worse we gave away DONG to Goldman Sachs in a corrupt deal and had an employee single handedly give someone €1
5 billion as a tax return
We are not as squeaky clean any longer
You jumped to 1st in 2018 from 5th in 2017
Just subscribed myself
Seems like a pretty casual sub so far
We'll see as more people join if it gets toxic
There’s also South Ossetia at 53k and Guernsey at 63k
The first one is recognized by Russia, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Nauru and Syria
Well there's a lot of contenders for Denmark, in my opinion
But if I should put something which I think most danes whould agree on atleast being a contender I'd probably pick this song: Kim Larsen - ["Om lidt"]
This is a song which is often a stable of danish funerals
It's about the ending of a big show
I have taken the liberty to translate the lyrics, keep in mind that I have translated nothing but the meaning
The rhyme scheme and number of syllabels are not consistent with the danish version
The original danish lyrics can be found [here
&#x200B;
\[Verse 1\]
Soon it'll be quiet
Soon it'll be over
Did you get to see what you wanted
Did you get to hear your melody
\[Verse 2\]
Abandoned and alone
The princess of the circus dances
Stops up on her line
Ind an unfathomable second
\[Chorus\]
Soon, soon
We will be gone
Maybe we'll see eachother again
\[Verse 3\]
Soon it'll be quiet
Soon it'll be over
Did you get to see what you wanted
Did you get to hear your melody
\[Chorus\]
Soon, soon
We will be gone
Maybe we'll see eachother again
Soon, soon
We will be gone
Maybe we'll see eachother again
Probably [Agnes Obel - Riverside] (live version, since original has been removed from Youtube for some reason)
It got a lot of international or at least continental wide European traction as well
Defo Sissel, i loooove her voice
I live in Copenhagen and in many ways, it's great - a good balance of green areas and city
Lots of culture and stuff to do
Public transport is great and getting around the city is easy - especially on a bike
Also unless you go to the super touristy spots, it doesn't seem overly populated
The main negative is how expensive it is
Both in terms of food and drink, as well as rent and stuff
In fact, the rent issue is so bad I'm leaving the city soon to move to mainland Denmark, as even with all the good stuff and how much I love it here, it isn't worth it
Even with a decent pay, you should expect half+ to go to rent, and then you wouldn't even get that much space or quality of the amount of money you pay
Went to Kraków last summer and absolutely fell in love with the city
I totally get why you would love your city too much to leave it - what a gem it is
I've lived here for 7 years studying, and there's no denying Copenhagen is beautiful and I've honestly enjoyed living here a lot
But if your job prospects are anywhere near regular and you don't have a solid network or pure dumb luck, you have to give up A LOT to live here
Especially since that "city's beauty" isn't too different from what you can find in, say, Århus (having lived very close to there as well, the only real difference of note is that Copenhagen is more exposed internationally and more hyped up nationally
Everything Copenhagen has to offer, Århus has something similar)
Say you make 30
000kr each month - that's higher than the national average and a decent wage to start with as someone with a master's. You would have 19500kr post-tax in most cases then
Likely you might pay at least 10
000kr of those to just rent (more if you want anything above 50m2), leaving you with 9500kr to pay utilities, food, insurance, transport, A-kasse, Fagforening, internet, phone, license and so on
The average cost of that per person is between 6000-8000kr
Leaving you with a maximum of 3500kr each month to put away for unforeseeable expenses and larger bills (dentist, new bike, whatever), as well as just money for regular things like clothes and Netflix and whatever
It's doable, but it's shitty and your prospects are basically live like that forever, get lucky and find something super cheap (unlikely unless you have a great network or was born under a lucky star) or take out a huge loan and buy a small apartment
And tbh, in my case, I just don't think it's worth it
It's likely also because I didn't grow up in Copenhagen so my family isn't here and most of my friends are moving due to being done studying and getting new jobs all over the country
Also, I kinda don't want to live paycheck to paycheck the rest of my life just so I can live in Copenhagen
I want a house at some point, a garden, things like that
And I can get a huge apartment in loads of places in Jylland near big cities like Århus, for less than half the price of a tiny one-bedroom in Copenhagen and thus still have access to all that Copenhagen has to offer, just in Århus instead
(Sorry about the rant, I'm done with my masters in a few months so it's on my mind a lot atm, haha)
My friend goes to Kraków every year (she's to one who took me there last year) and she speaks of the city just like you do :) We both are taking our masters in history, so it really is the perfect city for people like us
Absolutely gorgeous city
Unless you've rented or owned for a while (at least 10-20 years, which her grandfather likely has), is part of a boligforening (most of which have waiting lists of over 30 years), then all housing in Copenhagen or the greater Copenhagen is super expensive
In fact, even the cities around Copenhagen are equally expensive to the city
Take Virum, for example, the prizes there are the same as Copenhagen, but it's around 30 km away from Copenhagen
Or Hillerød, almost 50 km from Copenhagen but the same prices for housing as most of Copenhagen as well
That being said, Hvidovre - due to it not being a very desired place to live - is a bit less expensive than Copenhagen
Here you might pay 8500-9500 kr for 50m2 next to the minimum 10
000kr in Copenhagen (no utilities added in either of those examples)
However, if you look at a city like Århus, or maybe Randers (30 minutes from Århus by train, so around the same as Hviodre/Copenhagen only Randers is much bigger than Hvidovre), the average rent for 50m2 is 2500kr (Randers city center) or 5000-6000kr (Århus city center)
So yeah, to me, the financial struggle that comes with living in Copenhagen, really isn't worth it, when you can get more for less and even get the same benefits that Copenhagen brings, in other cities
I'm also a student - I get by with a student job and my SU
Like I wrote, I'm simply doing the math atm due to being done with my masters in December, when yes - I will start a different part of my life where making 30
000kr before tax, 19000kr after (low but decent starting wage for my education) and realistically only having the option of living in a 50m2 apartment with rent over 11500kr utilities included isn't the dream
And the quality of life, lifestyle and general feeling here, you can get in Århus as well, without breaking the bank to just have more than a tiny one-bedroom apartment with hardly even being able to afford the the option to go out for a drink every once in a while
You are a native, I get loving your hometown - I love mine as well
But Copenhagen really isn't that different from other large Danish cities
Nothing's wrong with Hvidovre at all :) I lived there when I first moved to Sjælland and have a boyfriend there now
It's lovely - it's more snobbery than anything else
I remember once someone on the Denmark subreddit wrote about how he was doing an exchange and had gotten a room in Hvidovre and what there was to do in the area, and all the comments were basically: "the only thing there is to do is grab your things, walk to the train station and go to Copenhagen". That's the general attitude
Other than that I found Hvidovre lovely
I used the km my company uses when registering our km pay, they might be off, but that the one my company claims is from Kongens Nytorv (where my workplace is) to the areas
I just checked apartment rent prices for Roskilde, though, and on both sites, I used they are no lower than the ones in Hvidovre (sometimes higher, even)
Hedehusene, however, I'll agree is cheaper
That being, it's clear you really love Copenhagen, which I understand
But this is my opinion
I'm entitled to it - I always wrote it isn't worth it TO ME
It might be to you, and that's fair
Two big ass dams
One between Scotland and Bergen in Norway, over the Shetlands and one between Dover and Calais
Then a couple of pumps so we can drain the Baltic and the North Sea and reclaim Doggerland
The dutch can be in charge, wth assistance from Northern Germany and Denmark
A train network, just as the one in japan, with all major cities connected
I think EU will help with the metro connection Copenhagen-Malmø and the Femern Belt connection, but I don't know the largest infrastructure project EU should build
It's already super expensive to be member of the EU, so EU shouldn't really use more money, but we are lacking super computers and space exploration/construction in EU
The sad thing is that the European interrail used to be better than it is now
Femern Belt construction starts in Denmark January 2021
We are waiting on Germany to connect the country from North to South
No they'd just get the land they already own there (by sea)
Nah
we don't really fight much up here
Never have
We're peacefull people
Yeah, that was my inspiration
It's just such a ridiculous project, but would be so awesom if it was ever build
Yeah
Damns for everyone
Although I recon Russia might have a word or two to say about getting a wee tad longer way to the atlantic for their fleets
Greater Copenhagen is turning into a metropolitan region with 4
3 million inhabitants
The train is nice and was a good start, but it takes 39 minutes from the Central Station to Malmø C according to the Journey planner
It's also needed to free up space on the Øresund connection to allow more freight through when the Femern Belt connection opens to Germany
The metro connection will be more direct to Malmø and only take about half the time of the train
And metro just feels more integrated and city like
The connection is currently in the fourth stage of planning and the expectation is that it could be ready by 2035 and cost 30 billion Danish kroner
It's just too expensive
Denmark is expected to send about 26 billion kroner (3
5 billion euro) to EU from next year, and we are getting less and less back from EU
It's crazy that the budget is not adjusted to the UK leaving and now EU even wants to borrow extra money, that we are responsible to pay back
There should be a hard cap of maximum 200 euro per capita in net contribution
The other route
Do you mean Fynen-Jutland-Germany
The train has five stops between the Central Station and Malmø C, and it goes in a big arch instead of a straight line
It runs every 20 minutes in the day
The biggest problem is not EU using more money on economic recovery and green climate
I'm not a fan of sending free money to the South, but on the other hand I don't really care
The problem is how EU is borrowing money which the member states are responsible for paying back
That is more federalisation
The increase in EU money spending could be solved simply by a hard cap of maximum 200 euro per capita in net contribution
Then countries like Denmark and Netherlands will not be hit harder than we already are
We need the big countries like France and Germany to start to pay up as well as other rich countries like Finland and Belgium, that are not contributing (net) very much
The hard cap I'm talking about would solve just that
Protecting the hardest hit countries while enabling EU to continue to spend a lot of money, where EU thinks it's needed the most
*We* should leave, because *you* want to spend more money
How about Ireland start contributing instead
The net contributions of Denmark, Netherlands, Germany in 2019 were around 175 euro per capita
Ireland: 5
5 euro per capita
Finland: 101 euro per capita
Is Ireland still a poor country
Finland is certainly same rich as Denmark but is still not contributing very much
We are talking about net contributing, so Finland and Ireland don't nessiarily need to send more money to EU - just receive less - and EU would have more money to redistribute elsewhere
But when will enough be enough
Right now there is not an upper limit to how much countries have to pay
26 billion kroner is not pocket change in Denmark
Maybe we'll do as you want and simply do as Norway, that pays much less than Denmark and still get to sell their stuff and study and live in EU
Who is that *we* that destroyed the Greek economy a decade ago
Remember we are not part of the eurozone
Edit: The four Danish opt-outs
You are not really answering the question when enough will be enough about how the member states can be asked to pay to EU
It's rather easy to ask others to send more when it's not your money
I find the 200 euro per capita to be a good compromise as only Denmark and Netherlands to my knowledge have exceeded that amount
Even this year no country is above 200 euro
If I understand your answer correctly, you don't want to set an upper limit, because you claim, that the ROI is positive
In other words you don't care how much money countries like Denmark and Netherlands can be asked to send to EU, not matter what we would prefer to use it on in our own countries
Your ROI claim is based on the poorer countries buying things from richer countries
You are forgetting you don't need to be an EU member to export to these countries, and that you can't be sure where they buy their things
To follow your logic we could say that instead of Denmark sending so much money to EU, EU could instead choose Danish export articles to be sent to countries in need of them
Denmark would then pay Danish companies directly that amount we otherwise don't get back from EU
That would be a win-win
>Hey, if you give me €20 I'll give you €50" and you'd say "BUT I WANT TO SPEND THE €20 ON MYSELF".
Hey, give me 50 euro and I'll give you 20 euro back, you can spend on what I decide you can spend it on
Then I'll use the leftover 30 euro on my life enjoying friends, hoping they use the money more wisely to turn it into 40 euro somehow, so they maybe will buy your expensive things instead of any cheaper alternative
Could you try and understand I'm not against sending 50 euro to EU
But not more than 50 euro when other similar rich countries only send 30 or 40 euro
When they reach 50 euro, then we can sit down and talk about if it's enough or if it would make sense raising the limit it to 60 euro
Not much within our borders but on a sidenote Finland does exist
The truth is out there
Sincerely a Dane
Fyn is just a highway connecting Denmark and Sweden (Sjælland/Zealand)
In newer history it would be Magrethe, Christian and Frederik thats about it
for boys: Harald, Gorm, Valdemar, Christian, Frederik, Svend, Christoffer, Erik, Knud
For girls: Margrethe
Christian, Frederick, Margrethe, Hans, Christoffer, Erik, Oluf, Valdemar, Abel, Knud (Canute), Niels, Harald, Svend, Magnus, Hardeknud and Gorm are the Danish options
Guess I only have one choice if it’s a girl and that’s Margrethe
If you include from the start of the kingdom then it would be
Gorm, Harald, Svend, Knud, Hardeknud, Magnus, Oluf, Erik, Niels, Valdemar, Abel, Christoffer, Margrethe, Hans, Christian, Frederik
With the fabled kings:
Halfdan (Dan for Danmark), Gram, Siger, Angantyr, Hroar, Hygelac, Helge, Frode
is Elizaveta the same name as Elisabeth or is it pronounced differently
Frederikke would be the proper way, at least in Danish and I think Swedish as well
Even though the queens were not monarchs by blood I suppose they became monarchs through their marriage (correct me if I'm wrong)
This means that names like Thyra (wife of Gorm the old), Ingrid, Caroline Mathilde, Dagmar and in the future the name Mary could be added to the list
Edit: nevermind, I'm wrong
~~Hardeknud is considered a lengendary king by most people~~
Edit: My bad, there is a non-legendary hardeknud
I would properly say no to this
The monarch is the the ruler of the reign or kingdom and the other half is the consort
How so
Hardeknud was son of Knud the great ruler of Denmark and England
Yeah, you're right
My bad, thank you though
Oh yeah my bad
I remembered Gorm's father Hardeknud:
You are assuming people would know where Dora was from and not naturally assume that she is mediterranean
She does have a stereotypical mediterranean name
The show does not exactly scream 'Murica

Maybe in English but here in Denmark hugo is not clearly an American
Hugo må ikke hugge (Hugo is not allowed to "take/swipe")
The idea of a soft k is one of the many reasons why Sweden sucks
In my city personally it’s weather the new buildings we have should have an old style or a modern style
Stylistically important but the house should function the same, just with different visual architectures
You can have a soft G but not K, AFAIK
Some people in Denmark thinks you crush your kammerjunker when eating koldskål or you don't put them in first, but that's because they are mistaken them for tvebakker
Some Danish exsmples would be
Brown sauce or no brown sauce in a beef sandwich
Wether a The birkes is a pastry or bun
Marmelade or creme in a spandauer/ carnival bun
My brother puts the butter on the side with holes
He says its because he likes that the butter goes in the holes, but I say it's because he's insane
Old and classic all the way
I don’t dislike moderne buildings, but a lot of the time it’s an excuse to build uncreative and boring concrete blocks
Those damn socialists/walloons/Flemish nationalists/antwerpians/people who shop at aldi/bmw drivers/vegans/recreational cyclists/virologists/MeToo movement/unions/company cars/muslims/priests/covid restrictions/education system/government/road network/landlords
They ruined Belgium
My girlfriend is a monster who puts butter under Nutella
I wish I knew that before we bought a house together
We all know Swedish is elf language
Try the speaker symbol on the normal language, and you can see soft K is not used
Not if it's not frozen
Like others have already mentioned, small ~~world~~ country
knowing someone who knows someone
There's a pretty good handful of celebrities where either one of my friends knows one, or a friend's friend knows them
Also works with random people
For example, a few months ago me and some friends were playing CSGO, when a Danish guy was on our team
I then found out that he knew multiple of my friends, and even went to a school nearby
We have the ability to learn multiple labguages
We obviously learn Danish
Learn English from about 6 years old in school, choose between German or French at age 11
Then at highschool, you may learn Spanish, and some places you can learn Mandarin
Do you guys still learn Danish at school
Or rather, is Danish still widely spoken on Iceland
yeah you always meet people that either went to your friend's efterskole, or happened to live 5km from where you grew up
it's almost uncanny aha
Sadly, the thing that makes me know where Sarajevo is located is that it was where the Temple of Nod was located in the Tiberium Wars series
Yeah, why bother memorising all these small countries, when Russia's gonna incorporate them all in 2022
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
I have always thought is was firben (lizard) in Danish, which means fourlegs
So that was the most distinct about the animal
It has four legs
Mariehøne (Marie Hen) - Ladybug
Næsehorn (Nose horn) - Rhino
Flodhest (River Horse) - Hippo
Jordegern (Dirt Squirrel) - Chipmunk
Pindsvin (Stick Swine) - Hedgehog
Hulepindsvin (Cave Stick Swine) - Porcupine
Vaskebjørn (Washing Bear) - Raccoon
Sommerfugl (Summer Bird) - Butterfly
Vandmand (Water Man) - Jellyfish
Næbdyr (Beak Animal) - Platypus
Søko (Sea Cow) - Manatee
Vildsvin (Wild Swine) - Boar
A spider is an edderkop (venom cup)
A sloth is a dovendyr (lazy animal)
Most marsupial names in Danish are just the name of a completely unrelated placental animal with "pung-" in front ("pung" means pouch in this context)
Examples:
* Opossum = pungrotte ("pouch rat")
* Water opossum = pungodder ("pouch otter")
* Numbat = pungmyresluger ("pouch anteater")
* Possum = pungegern ("pouch squirrel", though one species is called "pouch fox")
* Quoll = pungmår ("pouch marten")
Also, tufted ducks and king crabs are called "troldand" (troll duck) and "troldkrabbe" (troll crab) respectively, though I fail to see their resemblances with trolls
In Danish they are "lazy animals"
Almost no other land animal has four legs, right
So that's a wrap
Well to be fair, a strong military is kinda important when you want to stay neutral in the middle of a continent that’s had quite a few wars
How are you going to stay neutral if you can be invaded just like that
Ok thought you meant during the Cold War
I don’t know, call me old fashioned but I think there’s a good point in everyone (or potentially everyone) participating in the defense of the country for a while
We have conscription for men in Denmark too, but they need so few (ie the defense don’t get more money) that basically every conscript is a volunteer these days
Barbie Girl by Aqua probably
Although the lead singer is Norwegian, the band itself is Danish
Catchy, famous and overplayed
Definitely [Nede Mette] This one is a guily pleasure to me
A story about normal girl (Mette) who grows up to be a party girl and sleeps a different place every day
The hook/title is a word play on her name, it means ‘down with it’.
Øhm
Laid back - sunshine reggae
Thats a danish group too
Yeah
that was a bit embarrassing
More recently, but not quite as big, I would also say Lucas Graham - 7 Years
It was ok to begin with, but got played too much and now nobody really wants to hear it anymore
You´re from Sweden and you dont mention like 3-4 Abba songs that fit that criteria
None of what you mentioned comes even close to Waterloo, Super Trooper, Mamma Mia or Money Money
I cant watch it in my country :(
Wow, I had completely forgotten about that song - thanks man
Feel so sad that I can’t find pewds version on spotify
Thats not really what OP asked for
KODA (a Music organisation that make sure musicans are getting paid for their music) recently made a lot of music unavailable in Denmark - it’s really annoying
Gasolina is terrible
^^I ^^love ^^it
Oh, is *that* why my YT playlists are suddenly riddled with unplayable tracks
I went to listen to a playlist I made ages ago and now only 5/20 songs are available
Yep
I originally understood it as only being danish artist but it’s a lot more than just them
And it’s not all songs either
Like I love some of Tessa violets songs and some are available and others aren’t
Yep, it's because KODA is also responsible for the licensing of a lot of foreign songs when they are being played in Denmark
And since Google and KODA aren't good friends right now, everything that has to do with KODA is blocked at the moment
There are many, but at this point I will just mention "Letbanen" in Århus, which is basically a tram service
They have postponed it multiple times, they have crashed, run people over, and so on
Overall it has been nothing but bad press for Århus
Everything related to trains
We're not even electrified yet, and electrification is over budget and over time, because we're using an experimental system
We're getting an experimental signalling system, which is also billions over budget and over time
It will be more than a decade late
Not to mention our last set of trains, which were supposed to replace the old ones twenty years ago
They're still not running fully, and will be obsolete before they ever start running
The whole system is fucked, has been fucked for decades, and will be fucked for decades to come
Also, never buy trains from Italy
Oh yeah, and Copenhagen just got a new metro line, which has been many years late and billions over budget
Aarhus just got a tram line which was also several years late
I'm happy I own a car
It Also feels like every single highway and train tracks/station is atleast 2 years delayed
Absolute shitshow that one
The worst part is when they came out and said it couldn't run in cold weather
This is a bit ridiculous
Why would Australians blame Siemens just because they deliver technology to an Indian owned coal mine in Australia
Surely Australians should blame the Australian government if they don't want them to dig up coal
If you don't have a drivers licence or a passport you can get an official ID card with a picture on it
The healthcare card is not really an ID card
It depends on where you live
In Copenhagen, a lot of people only have the healthcard, outside most use their drivers licenses as their main ID
I grew up in Jylland and moved to CPH and was honestly baffled when I learned a driver's licenses isn't something everybody simply has
And I know my other friends who moved to CPH from other places in Denmark had the same reaction
I, of course, get it from a practical level, but it was simply mind-boggling because of how ingrained it is as "rite of passage" outside CPH
While getting my haircut yesterday, my barber told me that his brother, just bought a bunch of canned food
Hand sanitizer is sold out pretty much everywhere, but apart from that it's business as usual
Semi-related side note: I bought a six-pack of toilet paper when I was out shopping today, because we ran out in the guest bathroom
I guess I'm part of the hoarding hordes now
Well, not every country has the alpes melting into our water tap
Was mostly a sarcastic comment, basic infrastructure won't be allowed to fail
Hell would break loose
Forelsket
It means to be "in love" but only in the euphoric way
On the other hand the ugliest word is probably Ørred, a trout
We have a similar word in Danish: "Udlængsel", which is a combined word from "ud" and "længsel" meaning "out" and "longing".
For some reason that reminded me of Aising Bea explaining how ["Irish people naturally all think they're good singers because of the natural sadness in our necks
Well, they *do* call radio "kringkasting" ("Round-throwing"), so you're not *completely* off your rocker
Udlængsel :)
No, gulebøj means yellow bend
gul=yellow bøj=bend
And it's actually Norwegian, although a made up word from Sweden
It's becomming fairly popular in [Denmark
> Here are some examples
Lol, there was a kid called Loki
"Hey hon, have you seen Hades or Baal recently
Those sound great to me
Why would you hate your own culture
The English examples you mentioned sound fine, too
They're not even old-fashioned in the typical sense, since they weren't common with the older generations either
They might not fly today, but that seems unfortunate more than anything
At any rate, considering ones own traditional names ugly seems to me like cultural self-loathing
Joaquin Phoenix's siblings are called River (deceased), Rain, Liberty, and Summer
He apparently called himself Leaf at one point
Nothing tops Moses and Apple for weird sibling names, though
I wouldn't call a God a fantasy character (unless they are named after the Marvel guy, which, to be fair, isn't too unlikely)
Calling your kid Tor or Freja or Balder isn't uncommon either
It's just that Loki is
not the God you'd want to name your kid after
"Ah yes, the horse-fucking semi-demonic transvestite
That'd be a good name for my unborn son
I mean, Thor, Freja and Balder are all quite common names in Denmark
Dylan and Angus are also names from mythology, the same goes for Alexander and basically every biblical name
I get that giving ones kid a very unusual name would be awkward, but to me that has nothing to do with it being an ugly name in and of itself
We don't really have the problem in Danish though, as far as I deem - mythological/Norse names aren't common for the most part, but I have a hard time thinking of one that would be very weird
Hjalmar and Ragner are rare but not odd, and Torkild or Torbjørn sound Norwegian more than anything
Well, it's no coincidence, is it
The name is popular in France > France is viewed as classy > Working-class people have a tendency to give their children "exotic" and/or "wealthy" names, presumably to compensate > they give their kids French names > French names become associated with over-compensating working-class people
Carlbergium yeast that stabilised beer production around the world
Insulin

Windmills
Electromagnetism

Maybe not as revolutionary as some of the other examples in this comment section, but we're pretty damn proud of it
Probably the pH scale, otherwise i would say the Gram staining of bacteria
I'm just here to say the Norwegian cheese slicer is way inferior to the wire cheese slicer
the pH scale as well
Also, one that not many Danes know, programming language c++ (Bjarne Stroustrup)
And the modern speaker
I love the balance
Insulin, which has probably saved 1000s of life and then Lego, a literal toy
So basically: Germans love physics
But we got LEGOs
And before that with ZPI insulin, meaning the actual inventions that allowed insulin to have a longer lasting effect, essentially their invention made insulin a viable treatment, where it previously was just a thing
Possibly :) didn’t invent that much, discovered a lot
I thought a Dane of all people would know that the plural of LEGO is LEGO, not LEGOs
Ok but Bluetooth is named after a Danish king, so it's basically Danish
Right
I'd rather not get highway tolls
Sucks enough to pay to cross the bridge
Poor Sweden :'(
I think that's a bad idea
However environment regulations could make sense in a combined EU
Also, the vast majority of rail traffic is domestic
There are lots of sunk costs that will have to be paid to achieve something relatively marginal
Did you guys throw us out of Scandinavia without telling us
When the other Scandinavian (and Nordic) countries went for state control of the alcohol market, Denmark decided to massively increase the tax on liquor instead
If I remember my alcohol history correctly
Thankfully not, and it's very cheap too (compared to Sweden and especially Norway) Although snus is banned here
There's a saying that Swedes drive across the bridge for alcohol, and we drive across the bridge for skiing and snus
That's just a Jutland thing, I think
I know they think they're the entire country, but don't listen to 'em
But you can buy snus in most kiosks though
Don't listen to this Swede-pretend-Dane
Jutland is the only part of Denmark that is actually Danish
IIRC it's not the same thing that's sold i sweden
But im not a snus connoisseur so im not 100% sure
That doesn't mean that we're not part of Scandinavia
In danish the term “feltmadras” (directly translated “field mattress”) is used to describe danish women who slept with the occupying german forces
I think the closest thing to it was "tyskerpiger" which translates to German girls
It was used to describe Danish girls who dated or married Nazi soldiers
There were also other names like "feltmadrasser" which translates to field mattresses
It was also for Danish girls who dated or married Nazi soldiers
I believe there were some grandchildren of those girls who found a mattress in their garden, this might have happened multiple times
But when it comes to Nazism, Danish comedian Martin Nørgaard really described it well, when he said "The scary wasn't that it happened, the scary thing was how common it was"
A collaborator who ratted people (mostly resistance fighters) out to the Germans was called a "stikker"
It is difficult to translate
Stik means "stab" and "give", so it means someone who both stabs you in the back and gives you up to the police
If you rat your partner-in-crime out to the police, you're a "stikker"
If you rat your schoolmate out to the teacher, you're a "stikker"
Many Danish women were ratted out as having had affairs with German officers and they were alle spat on and had their hair shaven off
They were just called whores
It's not really a used insult anymore though
I suppose you could call a woman a "feltmadras" today but it just wouldn't make any sense so it's not really done
It's absolutely an insult though but an outdated one since the relevance of it is gone
They were called feltmadrasser (field mattress') in Denmark
I am danish but speak danish as a second language (Due to some bad advice from a doctor, I never was taught to speak danish growing up)
For the past 5 years I've been trying my hardest to learn danish, it was a huge hurdle to get danish people to actually speak to me in danish because many of them preferred to speak to me in english because they could already speak english, even my own mother
My grandmother was the one exception though because she doesn't speak english
It took about 4 of the 5 years to get good enough to have people tolorate my danish enough to have a convorsation with me
&#x200B;
So yea, I used to think it was a bad thing, but now I think that is just how it is
However, the origional poster is right, it is fun to speak danish (or mandarin, my third language) as a "secret" around non-speakers
But honestly, I've given it some thought and it would be super cool if there was an international language that nobody spoke as a native language
totally, when me a danish person speaks english with a french guy its becuse we where colonised

That's how you know it's a good game
The use of Gyöngy hajúlány in the trailer cemented it as an amazing game
As part of a feminism campaign a journalist decided to make yoghurt based on bacteria from her lady parts
She then proceeded to ask people to taste it and later tell people about it
If they got mad then she would blame people for not supporting feminism
Jesus, this is why feminists have such a bad reputation
I very much consider myself a feminist, but this lady is just nuts
Yep
Joking about feminists is a cheap shot because "everyone knows" we're "crazy". Stunts like vagina yoghurt really don't help
I watched the first couple of episodes, but I didn't get hooked
Maybe it was because I was too tired, and I shoud probably give it another chance
I recently saw another German series on Netflix though, called Tribes of Europe
That's a good one as well, and I enjoy refreshing my German language skills (or lack thereof)
Thanks Germany for the cheap everything just across the border
I'd like to thank Germany for the border, Denmarks only land border, wich was settled by voting, and for their cheap candy just on the other side of the border
Thank you for inventing the Cheese slicer, Norway
I want to thank Germany and Feroya islands for their amazing food
We Danes do not like Sweden though
Not winning world war 2
I'd like to thank Sweden for keeping our soldiers occupied for the entire lifetime of both our countries
Thank you Sweden for all your furniture, kitchens, tables, chairs etc
Thanks you Germany for your cheap everything and awesome autobahn
I second this
During the occupation by the Germans, many Danish jews fled to Sweden who accepted the refugees
don't forget Belgium
Ain't cheap bro
In Denmark we love what we call "Sport soda" which are sodas like 7up or Mountain Dew but quite different in taste
The most beloved one is Faxe Kondi but there are also Carlsberg Sport, Jolly Time and some others
Americans would probably call these sodas tasteless
I feel like we have a surprising amount of soda producers considering how small a nation we are
My own hometown of 9 000 inhabitants has two soda production companies
Faxe Kondi is legendary in Denmark
It's like sprite but better
It used to sponsor the major Football (soccer) league and even has a song dedicated to it
A soda would be Faxe Kondi, which probably is the most popular here besides Coca Cola
But we also have a huge variety of energy drinks and soda-flavoured alcohol which are only sold here
FAXE KONDI
[Faxe Kondi] It's kinda like Sprite but more mild, very popular
They also make [energy drinks] which imo are *way* better than Monster or anything else
We have Tuborg Squash (orange soda) that is more or less as popular as Fanta and Hancock Sport Cola which is a mix between cola and lemon-lime soda (Sprite)
We also have Jolly Cola which for many years was more popular than Coca Cola in Denmark
You can get Irn Bru in like 2 shops over here
It's great, I buy a can when I see one
But not as good anymore since they changed the recipe
I had it when I went to Slovakia
Got addicted
I'm sad now because I can't get it here
I spent 2 weeks in Germany and had Apfelschorle every day, and I have never had it before or since then
It is without a doubt the most delicious beverage to fizzle my tastebuds
Cocio is great, but I think Danes sometimes forget Cocio is Danish due to the commercials always being in British English, and when you buy a can they are likely never produced in Denmark
Cocio is great - the only trouble is that it seems to evaporate in a few seconds after you open a bottle
The standard F size bottles you often get as a deal with a hotdog just go down too quickly, I usually go for a G size to accompany my hotdog and pay extra
The smallest A size bottles are just a joke
one mouthful and they are gone
I despise Sprite, love Faxe Kondi
Definitely not related
I enjoy the sugar free version of the Faxe Kondi
Almost nothing but glucose, just how I like it
Not similar at all, the Danish "sport drinks" are basically Sprite (carbonated and very sweet, not sure why they're called sport), so nothing like Oshee
No clue, we don't have that here
Faxe Kondi isn’t my favorite drink, but I like it okay
Faxe Kondi Booster on the other hand is the grossest invention ever
If this is true, I might just love you
I think Faxe kondi booster is something you have to drink enough of to enjoy
I wasn't a fan in the beginning either, but now I don't mind it
Every time I see cocio, it is labelled Pfandfrei with the German system instead of the Danish pant system
So I guess it is produced in Germany
I'm pretty sure that all Cocio is produced in Esbjerg, which is also the only location they mention on their website
I'm sure they are able to produce cans with other languages than Danish printed on them
Sure, but have you ever come across a cocio can (not the glass bottle) with Danish pant and not German
Cause I haven't.
I have to admit I don't really look at the text all that much, and I try to avoid the cans
After shaking a can it usually splutters a lot when opening, which the glass bottles doesn't.
But you are supposed shake the cans
I have never had that problem to be frank
I fucking hate it
You can "disable" it by changing your youtube to GB instead of your native language
In your options menu (where the My Channel, Switch Account, Sign Out buttons etc are) there's a Language menu, change it to English and it won't auto-translate anymore
I hate that you can't turn it off
I don't mind the possibility of it being there, as long as the user gets the option to turn it off at will
I've never seen that happen
All my stuff is still in English
I have not noticed it, even though I'm on youtube quite a lot
I agree it sounds really bad though
Yeah, if you actually watch things in other languages I can see that being a problem
I don't really watch non-English videos anyway so that hasn't affected me
In my experience even some young Germans will be very offended about any jokes about Nazi Germany and the Germans having been Nazis
For example, one (very nationalistic) girl basically threathend to have her dad "deal with me".
Another German guy was really chill, he joked with me about it and since heiling isn't illigal here, he had a couple goes at that too
I remember that I was told many times growing up to never ever joke about WW2 around Germans because they can't handle it
The few (mostly older) Germans I know do get angry at WW2 jokes, but do you know how true it still is, especially around younger Germans
It really depends
If it is devolped in English, it's usually better than the translated version, due to jokes being lost on translation, or just things sounding stupid
English any day
English definetly, some translations are just off and some sayings don't have a translation so it just sounds wrong
English also just sounds more natural for video games and TV shows since I'm used to it
English
Most games aren't translated into Danish anyway but even if they were I'd still choose English since it just makes it easier to talk about the games online, to play with other nationalities in multiplayer and to avoid potentially shitty translations
It's a bit of both good and bad stereotypes, I find (being a from a rural area but living in Copenhagen)
Men will often comment on how they find girls from the rural areas "cute" and how we are "so innocent and straight-forward", which I guess is not the worst stereotype to have thrust upon you, but it does get grating
On the flip side, the overall stereotype is that we are less progressive (which really depends on the city tbh), less educated, and more prone to violence
Couple that with a lot of ignorance on how the rural areas actually are, as many people from the capitol never go to the area of Denmark that's considered "rural", and you get an awful mix of a large group people actually believing the stereotypes and the rest helping upkeep it by constantly joking about it
I would say the divide is growing in Denmark
More and more ghettos of a certain type of immigrant appear,
And more and more hate towards those ghettos follow with it
Mostly Jutland Vs Sjælland, not so much rural vs urban
Except for Copenhagen, everyone hates people from Copenhagen
Same here
I’d say it’s mostly banter though
yep
jylland (largest part of denmark) and sjælland (island where Copenhagen is) have an ongoing feud, where they both hate (in a loving sort of way) each other, and would hate to be from the other area
Yes
Though Jutland in itself doesn't equal rural
Most people live in cities, far from what people would call "rural". People just assume we call live in rural areas for some reason
OP here
People in Copenhagen like to ignore the fact that they also have rural areas, and that Jylland also has cities
But, to be fair, having lived in Copenhagen for seven years now, I can comfortably say I've met more native Copenhageners who never set a foot on Jylland or Fyn (nor do they ever want to), than I have those who have been there
So, of course, they wouldn't have any idea what it is actually like :)
Snow
What’s that
In all honesty I haven’t seen these even when we occasionally get enough snow, but they look really lovely, so I’d be down for adopting the idea
We don't get snow often in Denmark, but my family has sometimes made ice lanterns
The lanterns usually only last a few days before they melt
No, our snow usually don't last more than a couple of days
I've never seen one in Denmark
I used to make them, when I was a kid
I guess it was the [Seest fireworks disaster] in Kolding in 2004
It had the equivalent of 284 tonnes explosives
Luckily only 1 died but that was only thanks to a quick response of evacuating over 2000 people
Many of those could easily have died
If we're talking most impactful, I would say the bombing of the Institut Jeanne d'Arc
The institute, also known as the French school, was a catholic girls school ages 3 to 14 in the middle of Copenhagen
During WW2 the resistance in Denmark cooperated with British forces in order to bomb something called Shell House, where many of the high-ranking nazis had their offices, as well as several resistance members, was kept
However, one of the bombers that flew over Copenhagen lost control, dropping its bombs too early (into an apartment building, killing 11 civilians) and afterward accidentally crashed into the area next to the girls-school
The smoke and fire by the school meant that the second wave of bombers thought the school was the target, so they bombed the school repeatedly after
The third wave did the same
86 children below the age of 12 were killed (many below 5 years old, as the school, was also a daycare for toddlers), as well as 40 adults (most of the nuns working at the school)
Furthermore, 900 people lost their homes and 304 were wounded (67 of which were children)
[Here's an article (in Danish) on the event, with pictures]
His goal wasn't even to kill people with the bomb in Oslo, his goal was to attract the police there so he could shoot even more on Utøya
Luckily, the fire kept going through the night
Imagine if it had all been lit at the same time
Rest in peace to the brave firefighter who passed
A true hero
Germany: Thank you for cheap border shopping and excellent humor
Sweden: You are there and youre Swedish doing what swedes do
Norway: Thank you for A-Ha and just being so friendly and awesomeF
dear sweden as long as you promise not to cross øresund if it freezes, i will promise you to totally not bonk you with a stick as is my legal right
Would be awesome to get to know estonians
thank you my friend
“Alcohol at 16
” Lol it isn’t enforced at all

This is heartwarming, tak svensker
This is beautiful thanks
Satans svensker, du fik mig til at grine
We have Harry Potter with Danish synchronisation
You take Danish class
Sweden is the annoying big brother all the Nordic countries love to hate and make jokes about
Maybe where you're from
I can assure you it's enforced in other places in the country
Don't let him fool you with kind words
If the winter had been just a bit colder, they would have walked across the ice like white walkers and burned down Copenhagen
I think they're talking about this
Where
Certainly not in Copenhagen
I mean in some stores but then you just go to the next one
Like 50% of the cashiers are 16 year olds themselves
When I went to efterskole faaaar out in the countryside in Sønderjylland it didn’t sound to me like it was enforced in more rural areas
I remember watching this as a kid because I was too young for the English version
Even then I knew it was shit
Tbf to the Danish Film Industry, we normally never dub our movies with RL actors, so they don't have much experience of it
Of course you're from Copenhagen
Every single time i see a Dane say something outrageous on this site, you turn out to be from Copenhagen
You really are a different country aren't you xD
I can assure you, they do enforce it elsewhere
Granted i haven't tried every shop in the country, but I did as a teenager try shops in Nordjylland and Sønderjylland
And have since as an adult seen teenagers get refused in Midtjylland and Fyn
They usually don’t ask for ID when the worker is young as well
Just make sure to get there in the evening when most of the adult employees have gone home
At least that’s how it was for me in eastern Jutland and western Jutland
I drink cream on it's own
I'm not representitive for my country in this particular scenario though, I'm way cooler and more right
I want milk in my coffee, but pure milk I won't touch
When I was a kid even the smell would make me gag
My brother, however, would basically drink 1 liter per day
I dont mind drinking milk, and i've had my fair share
but these days i avoid it
too many useless carbs
what's whole milk
whole wheat but with milk
oh, we call it "sweet milk" (3,5%)
in Denmark only children drink it directly
Lars Tyndskids Mark - Lars Diarrhea’s field
Lars being a common name
Diarrhea is not very common
The fictional country of Langbortistan
The name is originally from the Donald Duck cartoons, but has spread to be used in general for places far far away
I think the English name it was translated from was Faroffistan
In Danish we mostly say “bøhlandet” which roughly translates to “boogieland”. Or you could say “Lars tynd skids mark” which weirdly means “Lars(common first name) diarrheas field”
In Jutland, Denmark we say "Lars Tyndskids mark" which directly translated means "Lars (as in the name) Diarrhea's field".
In Jutland, we have quite a lot of fields, often a few kilometers away from any houses, and atleast like 20km from a little town
The "Diarrhea" is to picture a person who doesn't exist I think (the name being ridiculous and all), and being in a nonexistent person's field, you are quite far away from any form if civilisation
A common expression is "Hvor peperet gror", meaning "Where pepper grows".
(It is NOT prenounced how you think)
I think it refers to India, which as many of you know, is a fair jog from Denmark
Langt-bort-istan was something I heard a lot growing up, it translates to far-away-istan
Also Jylland / Lolland :^)
Where the crows turn back is also used here
Langt-bort-istan in danish
I think they used that a lot in the old Donald Duck comics, but no hyphens, just Langtbortistan
I know, I decided on the hyphens so that the translation would make a bit more sense
"Haha France surrendered"
At least it took them longer than four hours
Sweden for a lot of things, we're quite living in the shadow as they're twice the population and many times the size
I once saw a viral post about them getting government support money for studying in university
We do that too, only the amount we get is more than double
Sweden got the credit
Norway for the vikings, even though Norway was technically Danish territory back then
Vikings were still right here too
When traveling abroad, our language gets mistaken for Germans but especially Dutch
People with very little knowledge of countries and cultures see us as "basically the same" as Swedes
We're quite different though, even culture wise
Especially Norway and Sweden gets credit for the vikings
Vikings are as danish as it gets
Ragnar Lothbrok was from a danish folk tale not, like the show vikings show, norwegian
And through the Faroese, the Danes get a bunch of flack as well
WE get blamed for it more than you, because the Faroes are part of the Kingdom
Are you telling me Finnish men can match the levels of metrosexuality in stockholmian men
I am astounded
We lost a lot of land though
We could have joined the Allies before Germany invaded and allowed them to set up defenses in our country
And, you know, even if Denmark would have fallen eventually, just being able to hold out for a couple of weeks or even just some days would have bought the Norwegian Army and the Royal Navy time to mobilize, making an invasion of Norway impossible
This is my favorite example of it:
It's so DRAMATIC with the music haha
Lots of commenters there hate us with a passion, unfortunately the comments over the last few years of the video existing have changed in tone
It used to be a goldmine, so many people wishing death to Danes over it
You're right, gotta freshen up my history knowledge
True that, if it's any comfort we do recognize and discuss your politics as being ahead of ours
You do new things if it makes sense, we discuss it endlessly and nothing happens
There was also the question of which side Denmark would support if they had to, so Denmark was not really expected to fight the germans at all
Well, looks like an afternoon of Epic Rap Battles, mixed with a healthy dose of Dan Bull
Yes, we lost Iceland, damn traitors, and American imperialists
The cities are much older, and the first skyscraper you build will look really out of place
The city I come from, Aarhus, had for a long time exactly one skyscraper(-inspired) building
And oh boy does [This] look out of place
“Klar eller eg, nu kommer jeg”
“Klar eller ej, nu kommer jeg
Her kommer jeg
In Danish it fucking rhymes
“Klar eller ej, nu kommer jeg
We just say here I come
So that comes out to: nu kommer jeg
In Denmark it is “klar eller ej, her kommer jeg”
Jeg ved det, prøvede bare at få det til at ligne det rimede med jeg
They speak Danish in Greenland, the Faroe Islands and Iceland, but I don't think it's really the native language any of these places
I haven't noticed any difference in vocabulary anyway
In North Schleswig though, there is a variant of Danish which can be very hard to understand
It basically sounds like mumbled Danish
And there's plenty of words there that most regular Danes won't have any idea what means
So I'd appreciate them just turning to regular Danish
Excactly
For example, I would switch to the Norwegian or Swedish number systems when visiting these countries
All accents are equally modern
Just because they've changed less doesn't make them less modern
Yeah it is, and tbf I wouldn't expect a Norwegian to know what seksoghalvfjerdsenstyvende is
That's fair, just be careful with what you say, because calling a language "more modern" than another is a very easy way to look pretentious / elitist
I'm not an expert on the topic, but I think it might be a case very similar to standard Danish and Gøtudanskt
The other Nordic countries and their state run alcohol stores and high purchasing ages
In Denmark you can buy all liquor from regular grocery stores, weaker alcohol (less than 16,5% I think) at 16 and all at 18, and most stores don’t really bother to check ID
In eg
Sweden, you have to be 20 to buy it in special stores and they’re really strict about it
They’re as big alcoholics as us (maybe barren Iceland), but their states has put up some weird hurdles
2 things:
That's really interesting, and TIL, so thanks
A liqueur is a spirit drink with added flavours, e.g. orange (Cointreau) or cream (Bailey's) and often sweetened
Liquor is a  spirit drink which is generally a "plain" base, e.g. vodka or rum
They (at least Norway, I know less about Sweden) seems to have a crazy drinking and party culture just like us
It doesn’t seem to prevent anything
Depends on season a lot, sun is setting 21:40 in Denmark today
Google (bare google det) “just google it”for looking things up
Nuttela for hazlenut spread
Jep, "drage" for both
It's also the verb "to wander" ish
Yep, in Danish the word for both kite and dragon are drage
In Denmark "drage" is used for both kite and dragon
In Danish as well: "Drage"
It’s the exact same in Danish, as with so many other things
Walk in the bike lane
I once saw a kid in a cathedral stomp on the balls on a Jesus relief on the ground
Okay, maybe not outright not intelligent, but his (probably religious) parents were nearby
I met an American exchange student recently, and he was explaining how you pronounce danish words, and as a native Dane (he didn’t realize at first) I corrected him, but he told me I was wrong until I explained that I am in fact danish
I just gagged a bit
For their gondola, obviously
That's kinda like taking a selfie in front of the pyramids
Totally fine IMO
So you take Jesus, you carve him into a large stone or tablet, and you make sure to emphasize his
holy bits
And Austrian also invaded us some 79 years ago
Could definitely be the case here, for sure
Is deadpan common on your side of the pond, though
My impression is that, while sarcasm is common enough, deadpan delivery isn't. Genuinely curious
Not to mention that you guys had some pretty damn fierce resistance
There's not a word for it
But there is a general (though kinda lighthearted) animosity between us in Jutland and all of Zealand, especially Copenhagen
Same in Denmark
Provinsen is everything outside of the capital
In Denmark we also use the word ‘landet’ in the same sense and ‘udkandtsdanmark’ as a negative term, but it seems like people don’t agree on what area it specifies :p
Der er party i provinsen
Almost never happens due to the Danes' ability to spot other Danes from a mile away
And if they aren't Danes, they are most likely either Swedish or Norwegian
Ethnicity isn't the main giveaway
It's the way we behave in a public space combined with our "bland" style of clothing and similar haircuts
Well both my parents are Danish and I live here in Denmark, but my passport says I’m born in Singapore, so technically not originally from here
But If I’m speaking English I’ll always be aware that most Danish people understand it
I usually have the opposite problem with Germans, in that they always expect you to speak their language
Everyone is taught German for a minimum of 4 (or 6, they might have moved it) years, but it's almost universally hated as a subject here, and barely anyone actually speaks proficient German
This is the only danish comment, lol
Edit: found another
I dunno why, but you give me this urge to stuff you into a freezerbox and silence you for the world
Visiting Hamburg a decade ago, I was surprised how many lederhosen I saw
I was in Hong Kong in 25+ degrees and some people were wearing Timberlands and thick coats
I wore as little as I socially could get away with, I was so warm
Border regions are quite integrated with people living in one country and working in another such as the Greater Copenhagen metropolitan region:
In Denmark I’d say the norm is to travel to another European country 1-2 a year, with 4 not being uncommon
You need a passport (in case anybody will check you, which if you go by train or car, is not given), but I’ve only ever met one person without one
We also do trips to other countries at school
I live in Denmark
If you are like me and live nowhere near a border you might visit the cross border shops once or twice a year
In my circle, it's often seen as a small "roadtrip" done with friends and family for fun and such
However I have had friends who would visit a border shop on a daily or weekly basis whenever they ran dry of cigarettes or soda
Some also work on the other side of the border, though that is less common, I guess, but not unheard of
It's also pretty normal for some families to go to theme parks or water parks in other countries for a weekend or a small get-a-away
This was all before Corona though
I don't really know now
I used to live close to the German border (45 minutes) and we went there maybe 10 times a year mostly just to get cheap beer and candy ( had a friend who had 3 hours of in the middle of the day and then choose to make the trip to get beer and sodas for an upcoming party
I live in Copenhagen and meet a lot of Swedes who are working here and commuting everyday from Sweden
People drive to Germany to buy cheap beer, soda, candy etc on a regular basis
We take long weekends in Berlin, London, Amsterdam, Paris etc all the time
So yes, it is very common to go to another country
Every year, thousands of danes go to Germany to shop at the border because it's cheaper down there
We just drive right through the checkpoint without any problems
Never been asked to show passport
Most people who live somewhat close to the German border regularly goes to Germany to shop because everything is cheaper there
Usually, before Covid, you could just drive past the border without even realizing if it wasn't for the sign
So yes, very casual
We go to Germany a month or two before Christmas to get some goodies
Most of the time it lasts until summer of the next year
A few times I flew between two EU countries and no one ever checked my ID, just the boarding pass
It was strange every time to say the least
I've gone on 8 school trips abroad during my years in middle and high school
One year we went abroad 5 times, 1 trip to Germany and 4 to sweden
We've also travelled to the UK and Dublin
It's not that Europe is that densely populated, Australia is just the definition of sparsely populated
Just the Benelux area alone has a higher population than all of Australia, despite being less than a tenth the size of NSW
> Dunglish
That's an amazing word
We actually got a national ID a few years ago but it's still not valid for travels
Hokus-pokus-filiokus (which is used in other languages too) is from the Latin "hoc est corpus filii" which means "this is the body of the son". It was of course said in church at communion
The people did not understand Latin, but they did understand that something magical was taking place, turning bread into the body of Christ, so it was all a bunch of hokuspokusfiliokus
Our highschool (or one of them; there a schools for 16-19 year olds which focus on general education, business or trades
This is for general education) is called gymnasium
That is very confusing for everybody else, especially English speaking visitors
I was an exchange student in the US when I was 15, and told people, that when I returned to Denmark, I was going to gymnasium for three years
They just looked at me funny
We have the weirdest loan-word from German
A kitchen strainer for fx
spaghetti is called a "dørslag" which literally means "door-hit" and it utterly nonsense
It is a Danish way of saying "Durchslag" - which in German means something like "through-hit".
A long, thin bread in Danish is af flûte, which means flute in French
Only long, thin bread in French is baguette and not flûte
I love the word bankerot (bankrupt) which comes from the Italian banca rotta (broken bench)
At Forum Romanum bankiers had their benches where they conducted business
If a bankier couldn't fulfill his obligations, the bench was broken
Karentæne (quarantine) is from Italian quarantina or quaranta giorni , meaning 40 days
In Venice ships had to stay outside the habour for 40 days to protect the city from plague
My favourite one in Danish is "dram", which means a shot of snaps, comes from the Arabic "drachme" meaning a small quantity
Is that actually a Swedish "thing" though or is it simply like jokingly saying "De nada", "No problem", "No problemo", "kein problem" or whatever to someone who said thanks
You actually have "nemas problemas" in the Swedish language
According to the Danish dictionary it came to us (and probably you also) from Dutch slaap (sleep) rok (coat) so it seems the word took a detour through the Netherlands on it's way north
Doesn't surprise me it's (mostly) foreign though
I've always thought it sounded strange
How is toxic a Persian loanword
It comes from Greek
The old meaning of bonde is more "free-man" than farmer (although most free men were farmers)
I didn't know that
Yes, it's the magic words
True
And gymnós means naked
Well, it does come from the greek gymnós (meaning naked
) which was a place for sports, being with friends and have intellectual discussions
Nice
That would be dørkslag in Danish
We do, but it is not that common
It is more an old word for pour
Hælde is more used now
Wereas the Swedish fönster is probably from German Fenster, right
I think you're right
I was misremembering it
Thanks for the correction
By second language you mean a language that is unintelligible to natives
Then Danish
German is considered a "main foreign language" and about 47% of Danes speak at least low level German
In Denmark it's, for sure, german
We start learning it in school from about 4th grade (10/11 yo)
I’m not familiar with the younger generation in general, so the following is based on my sister
My sister is pretty good at browsing the net and such (and has been for a long time) but with a computer she is slightly less capable
So things like activating caps lock instead of shift
I don’t know about her abilities in file saving and such but I imagine they aren’t great since she’s used to google docs since that’s used in school
Not really that country specific, but god damn, teach the children Excel
It is the single most useful thing they are ever going to need in math class, since Excel is something you are most likely to actually be going to use in future jobs and studies
It was first when I got in the Danish equilavent of High School that they started teaching Excel
That should be taught a lot more in primary school as soon as computers becomes mandatory in class
Same in Denmark
Though when children get to the age where computers becomes mandatory for everything school related, they tend to get better at file management and other computer related tasks
That is not too bad, but it's funny
I know mild part compatibility and some different things regarding files, but mostly modding and playing games
as a 30 y/o who have smoked weed for the last 10 years, and everyday for the last 5 years, its everywhere, and people who dont think it is, just dosn't know
It's very rare for me to meet a person who haven't atleast smoked once, atleast for the younger generation ( I'm 18 ) I would say it's pretty popular
In christania you'll find people of all ages as well
That's honestly a good point
Although it does seem a bit weird to me at least, that while we in Denmark have a very
intense, drinking culture, we look at drugs like something unproductive jobless people partake in
Then again maybe the alcohol is the reason for the happiness levels
In Danish sometimes you can also leave out a d if it's there like Svend/Sven or Bendt/Bent
There's also:
Kamilla/Camilla
Fillip/Philip
Christian/Kristian
Nikolaj Kan also me be spelled ***4*** different ways with C/K and I/J resulting in Nikolai, Nikolaj, Nicolaj, or Nicolai
It's can truly be hell to write Danish (or Norwegian) names sometimes
Not a native, but people often mix up then and than (which do not sound similar in any way) and the ole they, their, there, they're
Overall it's fine
but as with any other place on the internet, people keep writing "then" when they mean "than"
and the other similar mistakes (their, they're, and so on)
Noted
Oh that is very much a native speaker issue
I went to Ireland to pursue a career in technology
What I found was an amazing international community where I got the best friends of my life
It was also a cultural eye opener for someone like me that never studied abroad
Regarding jobs I was super disappointed tbh
I came from an open and direct culture in Scandinavia where no one is worth more or less in a conversation
What I experienced in Ireland was a work culture that was founded in distrust to the employee and focus on hitting obscure KPIs instead of focusing on efficiency and value generation
So in essence I was so happy to get the personal development and the experience, but the professional experience and living conditions where horrible
90% of the international community I was there with have since left to other European countries or went home
Not exactly left left
But I am a Dane who has been working and living in the UK for some 9 years now
I like it here
I havent but my sister moved to sweden cause she dislikes our government
I think that's generally the case for Scandinavia
I worked for a couple of years helping expats integrate into Danish society, and more than once I've had to point out how weird it is that Danes don't really leave the country like is common in other countries
We'll go abroad for a year or a couple of years, but always with the intention of coming back
And tbh I think it boils down to how good we have it here
Unless you move because of romantic reasons or a job offer, or because you don't like how Scandinavia is, most of us see going abroad as an adventure, whereas in some other countries (I assume) it's something that's necessary
Same here
Denmark is fine but there’s so much of the world out there, I want to explore it all
I didn't say it wasn't :) it's one of the main reasons why I wrote 'some other countries'.
Mind you, I'd say well over half of the expats I dealt with was from UK, Germany, and France (mostly Germany, mind you), so people do move out from those countries
Just like they do move from Denmark and the other Scandinavian countries - it's simply for other reasons
Denmark; no, not really
We have some woods where you can be alone if you are lucky, but being a small country, it would be hard to live as a total hermits
There are stories though, of people living in the woods, but they will never be able to have full privacy
I don't mind the lack of it, although I do like to hike in big nature areas such as you would find in Norway or Sweden
Several of the northern rebellious provinces have vast areas of wilderness
But in the heartlands it's all planned and accounted for
So much so that what Danes call "nature" is what others would describe as industrial farming
We need to say "wild nature" to emphasise "nature not touched by humans".
That being said, the coasts are pretty need due to our policy of keeping them free of buildings and human activities
And if you go to the other parts of the Kingdom you suddenly have the Faroese Islands and Greenland
And that's [freaking] [amazing]
Nowhere in Europe has unspoilt wilderness
Swedes and Norwegians will point to Lappland, but Lappland itself is named after the Lapps/Sámi
They, though less populous, have certainly exerted a large influence upon the region
Lappland would look very different, and be home to many more species than it is today, had it been genuinely unspoilt
That said, I am of course being quite pedantic
Under that definition of "unspoilt", nowhere save Antarctica fits
If you include Greenland, we have tons of it
Like, a lot a lot
That being said, people tend to congregate where it's easy to get to and where everybody else is
I live near a lake/heath/wood area where there's a large parking lot right by the main road
There's always lots of people there, especially because the marked path is 2 km which is just the right length for old people and families with little kids
A few kilometers from there, you can drive down a long gravel road to reach a much smaller parking lot where the marked path is much longer (8 km)
I've been there lots of times and only met other people maybe twice
Absolutely love it
Last vacation I had in Scotland, my wife and I drove all the way from Inverness to Tongue and back the same day
The scenery is absolutely breathtaking and I can't wait to go back again
Don't miss the midges though, any chance of them being eradicated
That's true
I flew over Greenland once and it is amazing
The ice just goes on and on
You're not allowed in our club
Jk, we love you, Suomi
That is horrible news
You have my sympathies
Well, Denmark isn't on the Scandinavian Peninsula, but it is part of the geopolitical area named Scandinavia because of the cultural and linguistic similarities
It definitely wouldn't go down well in Denmark
never gonna happen, too many closet racists voting populist right wing parties
I don't think there is one
That's isn't to say we don't have newspapers who fill the role you describe - I can  think of several that do, as well as several politicians throughout history that have been brought down by those newspapers
But I don't think the politicians fear them
Why would they if they have done anything deserving of being brought down
Maybe Journalista
dk all though it’s not a real newspaper
Uncovers bad public spending
propably Norway
Norway is like the pseudo-twin to Denmark; exploring the west together while Sweden headed east
isolation and harsh conditions brought quite a few old scandinavians together
Probably Norway
Basically north sea empire and sruff 1000 years ago
Aren't you pretty good freinds with Austria
Our family used to enjoy visiting England together on "vacation"
I would say Norway as well, but I feel like there are tensions from Norwegians towards us Danes
Maybe because, we used to rule them, idk
Maybe some Norwegians can add some more insigths
Well, Scania is Danish anyway
Love me a good trip to the local English monestary
That's how Scandinavia works
As it allways has been whether you want it or not
Return of Skåne/Scania and Schlewswig-Holstein when
Oh my, I had no idea
Same here
Hviderusland
Moosefuckers
Nothing, friend
Very sarcastic (like everyone else's on this thread) and sometimes racist/sexist
It's like British but
yeah it's kinda just as dark as British
Ok thats good
The secret to Danish is beer
Most of the Swedes I have seen in Copenhagen seem to have discovered that
Well, not really a nerveous break down, but a break down of a sort
Danish prime minister breaks down laughing in government, while talking about buying circus elephants - one in particular, and her best friend
Subs in english
This is a long time ago, but Ditlev Gothard Monrad who was our Councilpresident (what we now call Stateminister or prime minister) in 1864 had quite the freakout
Long story short: He and his government were convinced we could win the war of 1864, despite how much the Prussians had kicked our asses back in the three-year-war, so they declared war on Slesvig-Holsten
I guess they thought they would have Russias support again, but because we were the agressors this time Russia understandably told us to piss off
Even our King Christian IX had tried to convince D G Monrad that it was a bad idea, but he wouldn't listen
So war was declared and it immediately looked bad
The Prussians were kicking our asses and moved closer and closer to Copenhagen
Christian IX ordered D G Monrad to declare that we surrendered but he refused, and eventually Monrad just started shouting (much like in Der Untergang) that the Danes would fight to the very last man
Every man, woman and child would fight in the streets and we would win
So the king fired him, like he should've done waay sooner
And appointed a new temporary government that made peace with the Germans
My first thought was Bertel Haarder, who was a minister at the time, who broke down in anger and swore at the journalist because he was interrupted while eating rice pudding to go on television and now didn't even have time to go to the theater
His tantrum was so bizarre that at least one person made a [techno remix]
Haha, good take on it :D
That rant was pretty epic
We’re just not good a confrontation
Probably that we hate the swedes and that Skåne is a part of Denmark
Although some people don't mean it as a joke, which just makes it funnier
Rasmus Paludan
By saying we hate Sweden, we also half make fun of those people
It's a reference to a law that is misunderstood
The common understanding is that we are allowed to hit people with sticks if the cross the frozen sea
Yes, I watch German news because it is important to me
Austrian because it is comedic in a fun way
Swedish because it is comedic in a sad way
I follow my own country’s (Denmark) politics very closely
I think we have a lot of interesting stuff going on at all times, so it’s a fun little side-hobby
The Faroe Island and Greenland are represented in the Danish parliament, so I feel it’s very relevant to follow their politics too
I check in on the rest of the Nordics from time to time, but don’t really go that much into depth there - Sweden, Norway, Finland, Iceland, Schleswig-Holstein
Germany too, just because I love Germany
I've been keeping an eye on Poland for a while because I'm lgbt and there's a lot of talk about queer rights over there at the moment
Yeah
Danish politics since 2014 have become Eastern European Populism tier sadly
Why not
Lol we hiked that mountain on a boarding school trip
Well, since there's no age requirement to drink alcohol here, it's literally impossible to do underage drinking
In my experience starting drinking at 14-15 is very common, although I haven't been that age in way too many years
I am 16 and can confirm
Drinking in Denmark usually starts around confirmation age, and gains frequency through the teenage years
Teenage drinking is basically an integral part of Danish culture
I can confirm this
Generally kids that young don't drink
My parents allowed me to have a tiny little taste when I was around that age but no more
Parents usually allow their kids to drink around the age of 14-15 and you can buy weaker alcohol (beer and such) from age 16
When you're 18 you can buy the harder stuff
It is (or at least it was when I was a kid and for my social circle, I can't speak for the entire country or different generations) common enough for parents to allow children 8-10 to have a taste of alcohol (beer or cider, not vodka and stuff), but in most cases you wouldn't be allowed to just take a beer and down it
Around 13 when you go through [confirmation] it's common to drink weaker alcohol like beer or ciders during the party to celebrate your ascension to adulthood, and at this point you are more likely to be allowed to have a beer or cider during events such as family gatherings
Then around 14-16 you get more and more freedom in regards to going to parties and stuff where drinking happens, especially when you go to high school (~16-19) considering they will have events with alcohol involved in my experience
When a 10 year old asks for a beer they'll usually get it, and their parents will smile when the kid inevitably realizes that beer had a.. peculiar taste that apparently is unpleasant for kids
Personally I started asking my kids is they wanted to share a beer with me when they were 12-13 years old, and when they reached partying age around 15 I sat down with them on a weekend and got them tipsy, just so they knew how it felt and what to look out for
Seems to have worked out fine since both of them seem to enjoy getting tipsy, but don't like being roaring drunk
There is nisse øl which for an American is a light beer and for Danes something you drink when you are 5 years old, so you could argue we drink as kids also
No it is illegal to sell alkohol to minors, but not illegal for private people to give alkohol to minors
I've had that happen on my friends while we were on a school trip to England once
They tried to purchase hard liquor, were asked for ID and provided it
Then they turned to their friends and said something, after which the cashier demanded *they* show ID as well, since they were with the people buying the alcohol
Then *those* people turned to *their* friends and commented how silly that was, after which those last friends were also asked to show ID
When it turned out they were under 18 (though the people actually buying the alcohol weren't), the cashier called the cops
That sounds absurd, but I know it happened
This was in Oxford
At the last election 14 parties were on the ballot, of which 10 was elected
We have two major parties who both are seen as being placed in the middle of the political spectrum but each point slightly towards left/right
However you have to hold a majority of the vote and therefore you have to get along with other parties to create a proper government
Currently we have a social democratic prime minister, with radical left(not what you think they are), SF and the red-green alliance as supporting parties
That’s a whole lot of parties
No there is a party whose name translated to radical right(sorry wrote it wrong) and they’re not really radical and they’re really not very right-minded
To be fair I think SF is slightly more radical than radical left but not by a lot lol
Are you talking about Radikale Venstre
That would be "the radical *left*" if translated directly but is called "the social liberal party" in English
Holy - i still mix up right and left like a child
(Gotta edit that one more time)
The 'Venstre' (left) in "Radikale Venstre" refers to the major center/right party "Venstre", and not left as in left wing- they are a centrist social liberal party
Venstre used to be in opposition to Højre (right) - now called the Conservative Peoples Party
These 2 parties (Venstre and Conservatives) are now allies, and traditionally the government-forming parties on the right wing
Dude I was just pointing out OP messed up translating the name
Yea maybe I replied to the wrong comment
I just wanted to clear up misconceptions for our readers
When I was poorer I was very good at shopping around for newspapers and magazines giving '1 month free' or 5 dollars for the first 5 issues offers
I could probably still do that I wouldn't be harmed one bit, but these days I'm actively paying for newspapers because I believe that is important to do
Long story short, I paid my friend half of the expenses for recovering a Jäger Meister someone took from him just because they didn't take my booze, which obviously wasn't his fault
I pay for the support for a political party, which also grants me a form of membership
Same here
Whenever they go on a donation drive I kinda think about how damn much I actually use Wikipedia, and throw them a few bucks
Most people have one first name and 1-2 lastnames
A generation back, most people had only one last name but today kids usually get both the father’s and the mother’s last name
Some have middle names but it is not common
Nicknames are rare and mostly used in very limited groups
Middle names are pretty common
It’s very few people I know that don’t have middle names
I believe you can have exactly one lastname
Unless the names are hyphenated to form just one name any other surname is considered a middle name (or firstname in systems that don’t use a middle name)
Really
Like a "firstname" middlename like Jacob, Thomas or Anne or a "lastname" middlename like Jensen, Holm or Winther
I can barely even recall a handful of people throughout my life that didn't have a middle name
There may have been more, but it feels like a very uncommon thing to me
And yes, usually simple first names serving as middle names, though they also tend to be somewhat obscure or even outright foreign
I assume it depends on location, only 1 guy in my class back when i was a kid had a middle name, but speaking with someone from Copenhagen he said basically everyone has one
If a current state admits it carries a responsibility then there could be made a legitimate demand for reparations
In 2017 it was the 100 year anniversary for the sale of the US Virgin Islands
And along that event was a bunch of Danish media attention to the Islands, which eventually prompted the Prime Minister to try to "reopen/renew" relations with the Islands
This was quickly followed by talks of reparations, some whining about their financial situation and random accusations of racism
Then ofcourse came the question of admitting guilt for slavery, following the talks of reparations
The government decided to deny any guilt and that was pretty much the end of that "renewed" relationship
No reparations were paid and the Islands have been paid no attention since, but they did put up a statue in Copenhagen to "honor" the slaves
Ofcourse all of this was a very minor issue for Denmark, as we could easily ignore the Virgin Islands forever, but with larger and more important countries it's a real dilemma if you should admit responsibility
For Germany it was worth it in the long run, but i doubt we'll see Belgium admitting anything for a while
Not until DR
Congo seriously presses the matter at least
I’m not too sure, but I think you might be right
Atleast I know that he hired some Danes and Swedes to “help out” down there
What does current royalty think about what their grandfathers did
They should close that monarchy in shame, along with the rest
Hmm still shame on them :)
I would still have crippling epilepsy and mental health issues so I would probably be “possessed by a demon” or some shit
My mom's family has been sailors for ages
So a gay sailor
Eat beets and cry a lot
I would have been deaf, and a widower dad since my wife would have died at childbirth
As for jobs, I'd probably work at a newspaper, since my dad was a journalist and later an editor
You are describing a Danish porn movie
Morally yes, practically
Not if we did it alone, but if the EU as a whole stood up to China, I think the results could be positive
Absolutely
Taiwan shows what China could have been, and that's why China hates them so much
Where does Santa Claus live
For example, in Denmark it's said that he lives in Greenland
Where does he live according to your tradition
Danish Santa Claus (literally called "the Christmas Man" lol), lives in Greenland
Greenland, though slot of people say the north pole
Everybody is saying either Lapland or Finland
Well
in Denmark it is commonly believed that he lives in Greenland
Don't worry, Denmark is also claiming the North Pole
We have "farm santas" in Denmark as well
We call them "nisser". I rember once feeding the one that lived on the loft of our barn
What do you call them in norwegian
What is the weirdest thing a tourist has mistakenly thought that you have/do in your country
I just saw a clip from "The Last Leg" where a person from New Zealand was insistent that mince on toast was a thing in Britain
Even though the Brits on the show repeatedly explained to him that it wasn't.
Have any of you experienced something like that
In the end of the semester, a chinese exchange student in my uni class said she thought it was so nice that people biking would wave to people across when approaching an intersection
When you slow down on a bike in Denmark it is customary to raise your hand besides your head to show bikers behind that you are slowing down
I can still imagine her waving to random people across the intersection when biking around town, thinking that they waved to her first
Edit: [Pic for anyone interested]
That we actually HATE Sweden
That we actually BEAT a cat in a barrel during Fastelavn
In Denmark many people use the [høvding] bike helmet which wraps around the neck like a collar
Someone posted on Reddit saying he visited Copenhagen with his father, and the dad thought they were because many people had hurt their neck
While on the subject of Chinese and foreign exchange students, we really should teach them a bit about Danish foods just to help them out
Once I was standing in line at my university's cantine and one of the dishes on the menu that day were tarteletter
A Chinese girl in front of me did not know the dish and put small frikadeller in the tartelet shell and the stuffing on the plate
I did not say anything as I did not want to embarrass her
Now you learned a fellow Danish person something new
I live in a small town in Jutland (I suppose you live/lived in one of the four biggest cities since there's a uni), and here the only custom is that you stretch out your left/right hand when turning left/right
I've never seen the cyclists here indicate that they're slowing down, but then again there's often not any cyclists right behind you
In the larger cities where bikes are everywhere, it makes sense you'd have such a signal
Ah yes, we all know that Italians must at the age of 13 demonstrate that they can identify 15 different types of wine, by taste alone
That's just sad
That means he's not just terribly ignorant about another country (which is excusable) but he's also terribly ignorant about his own
He made it all the way to a fancy restaurant without realizing his view of the country was wrong
I must say, quite a large amount of these stories seem to be about Americans
Well if we speak a bit slowly and enunciate, we definitely can :)
Most of these stories seem to be about americans
Now that's just sad
We also do that, but not with the hand next to your head
To say "thanks" in traffic we normally do a small nod or lifting one's hand slightly while looking at the person
On a bike I can just raise my hand flat towards them while looking at them, but this is different to holding one's hand high and next to one's head to signal you're stopping
:-)
I mean in the sense that we don't wish bad luck on Sweden and we don't want to beat up a Swede if we meet them in the streets
I can only wonder why he went to Finland in the first place, if that's what he thought it was like
It's not like North Korea is a tourist hot spot
That's simply because Danes generally understand Swedish better than Swedes do Danish
If you are asking in Swedish and they understand, they are likely going to reply in Danish
Every computer system ends up not working, and going over budget
Our tax authorities managed to lose track of roughly 100 billion DKK in tax revenue a while back
And in general our tax authority seems completely incompetent when it comes to implementing a functional IT system
The police in Denmark have been using mobile antenna data for years in court cases, to tell wether a person was located near a crime scene, as part of evidence
the data was full of errors in some cases, causing possibly innocent people to be convicted based on this
This was recently leaked in the press, and the police had known about the possible issue from a former employee who reported the issue back in 2013
he left afterwards, because they ignored him
Now multiple cases gotta go back in court
It's completely idiotic
[Great video on the subject here]
If you do not understand portuguese it is not nearly enough
Read about NotPetya
A huge cyber-invasion that took advantage of a certain vulnerable windows-protocol that only got fixed in the update leading up to the attack
The attack even hit patched computers by going through unpatched ones and shut down several companies as well as most government assets of Ukraine from what I remember
I mean, a cyber-invasion cost a total of 10 billion dollars of damages because of a hole in a windows protocol that then got fixed in the update afterwards
IT and tech is super important to keep up to date with in regards to security
I know, Mærsk was a company that took a huge hit (about 300 or 350 million dollars of damages) as the suggested security overhauls never went through because the people that had to do that didn't get a bonus
Hygge is apparently so difficult to translate, that the word has been adopted as an English word
*Døgn* as mentioned by others is missing in English, I think
A *døgn* is 24 hour (day and night)
Edit: Maybe you say 24-hour day
Not just English, it irritates me that most languages don’t have a gender-neutral and uncomplicated word for boyfriend/girlfriend
In Denmark, they’re your kæreste, no matter yours or your partner’s gender expression
It has no awkward double meaning (like how “girlfriend” can be awkward for a lesbian couple and in German the word for male friend and boyfriend is the same), and it doesn’t sound childish
English used to have a feature we still have in Danish and Swedish, which is the "negative" yes and no
Basically the difference is whether a question is positive or negative:
"Are you coming to the party
" is the positive form to which you'd reply "Ja" or "Nej", i.e."yes" or "no". This is the only form still in use in English
If the question starts off negative, you use the negative forms:
"Aren't you coming to the party
" -> To which you'd say "Jo" or "næ". In English this used to be "Aye" and "nay"
"Vemod" or to be "vemodig" is a curious Danish word that describes a sort of happy sad feeling
It's like very mild melancholy
It's what you feel when you finish high school or something
You're sad that you won't see your friends on the regular anymore, yet you're happy that you're sad about this - you had good times after all, and you wish the best for all of them
Or in autumn, you're sad about summer ending, yet also happy, knowing that spring will come again soon
Hygge
It's getring a little annoying to always say "cozy get-together with friends and family time"
“Hygge” ofc just noce cozy warm family stuff like that
Another one is more slang but still very versatile “spurgt” directly translated meaning “asked” its just a way of saying “who asked
Very nice to have when you just get unneeded or unwanted info
Yeah, for danish it is spelled “døgn”, but means the same thing
Would be great to have the equivalent in English
Denmark also has “døgn” same meaning, v cool
Kinda like the danish “overskueligt” which means easy to look over, as it’s easy to understand or do
The fact that English doesn’t have that is just really træls
Also, I've yet to find a perfect translation for "ærger" (jeg ærger mig)
Døgn is indeed a useful word as it doesn't relate to time of day or the date at all
If there's some military exercise that's been going for 72 hours, that'd be three "døgn" no matter what time or date they started and finished
And since we also have "dag" (day) it isn't as ambiguous as "Day" in English
Even better is Danish "forgårs", basically like saying 'fore-yesterday" in English
Because "the day before yesterday" is just a linguistical atrocity
Yeah, we have "menneske" which is the same as "Mensch". It is used fairly often as well
I guess "human" is the word that comes to closest
English has adopted the Danish word *hygge* now
“Flabet” is also good, meaning annoying/flippant attitude
Don't you just say 24-hour day
English was just being træls for a long while
That's Jutlandish, not Danish
It's *ærgrer* but yes the closest English words would be irritates or unsatified
If you talk about how many cars cross a bridge in a day, it's contextually implied that's both the day and following night
Or if "this" happened in a day
An (police) rapport for the previous night and day would be a *døgnrapport*. Could you say a midnight rapport to imply it's from midnight to midnight
Funnily that (as far as I can tell) is pronounced exactly the same as the Danish word for he
That could also be your wife/husband
But how much do people really use that
It just feels awkward to me but I’m not a native speaker so disregard me completely
We don’t have any gendered terms so the gender-neutral term is the standard one
We do use farfar, farmor, mormor and morfar
Yeah but it’s a super over-commercialized version
I saw an article that called hygge “a fantasy that could never come true” because apparently you need Georg Jensen China and organic hot chocolate brewed by virgins and cashmere wool socks to even begin to THINK you’re having a hyggelig time
You can hygge with cup noodles in your small messy student apartment, the fuck
Let's chill and watch a chilly movie in a chilly place
That will be a lot of chill
I think you're right, I got that mixed up
Is "nä" not a thing in Swedish
Both words are very similar and mean exactly the same in Danish
Here's some Danish and German added:
"Du hörte *väl* om statsministern
"Du hørte *vel* om statsministeren
"You *did* hear about the prime minister
"Du hast *wohl* über den Premierminister gehört
(German) (perhaps more *ja wohl*)
"Tyvärr, jeg har *ju* en tenta"
"Desværre, jeg har *jo* en eksamen"
"Sorry, I *do* have an exam"
"Tut mir leid, ich habe *ja* eine Prüfung"
"Han är *ju* en idiot"
"Han er *jo* en idiot"
"Well, he *is* an idiot" (doesn't work as well)
"Er ist *ja* ein Idiot"
A lot of the meaning depends on your emphasis and intonation
German could also use *doch* a lot
Oh yeah you are right
It's ærgre though
I don't know why my phone didn't correct that . That being said I feel like irritated and unsatisfied doesn't really fit
And it’s very common to never get married so someone could’ve been together for 15 years and still kærester
I’ve known of a married couple who still call each other kæreste (means dearest) because it’s just way cuter than wife/husband
How about *ja* or *wohl*? Here are [a few examples] from a non-native German speaker
Yes, it's a bit different in Danish as a day means a day
So when we talk about what happened in the day and night, we say - this happened in a døgn
But in English it would then be alright to say - this happened in a day - and people will not mistake it for during the day
No not as such
We do have "den" which is either gender but it's often seen as rude to use about people
It's rather quite common make fun of the Swedes for hen
Oh no, not at all
I just wondered how widespread it is
Like in Danish we have the word partner too but no one uses it
Morfar/mormor and farfar/farmor are both bedstefar/bedstemor
They are bedsteforældre
So it depends, how specific you need to be
They exist but no one uses it
Farmor doesn’t have an awkward double meaning
Which is what bothers me about girlfriend and “Freund/Freundin” (literally just friend and female friend)
Plus kæreste means dearest
Too cute
No that's really wrong, bedstemor and bedstefar is definitely also in widespread use
I think it might be more common in Jutland though
Feel free to review my non-native examples linked above :)
It's seen as Sweden being overly PC / Swedes being SJWs
I think in your examples we'd use "den" but I'm not 100% sure
Either that we'd just say "the person" instead of using a pronoun
Similar to English you can say he, if you don't know the gender
Fair enough, I’m in Copenhagen and I never hear it
But we can all agree that farmor and farfar is used too
Definitely
It's all mixed up in my family, we call farmor, farfar and morfar just that, but mormor we call bedstemor for some reason
Thanks
Also, what do you think about "Du hast *ja doch* über den Präsidenten *wohl* gehört, oder
" I'm just trying to play with compositions
[Østerport II] has been awarded the architecture monstrosity award in Copenhagen by referendum
[BLOX] is also a contender
Especially considering the location on harbor front amongst older buildings
Or [boring office buildings] also close the harbor front
Rebæk Søpark (think that's what it's called) is the ugliest building in the country IMO
[Looks like something straight out of the eastern bloc
It's a residential building, not a hospital or anything, which would at least have made it's looks slightly more justified
Great contenders
BLOX for me is really one of the ugliest things in the city
I might be partial since I have to look at this eye-sore every day, but my first thought was [Carlsberg Metropol] I take very specific joy in the fact that it's falling apart
Kalvebod Brygge for me, prime real estate on the sea front completely wasted on buildings that look like they should be in Høje Taastrup
I get almost angry every time I'm there (also the worst stretch of the Copenhagen Half Marathon)
[The Central Bank] is famous for being loved or hated
[please don't link directly to Google]
We do have ghetto areas like [this] but I think [new buildings] are the worst
They are just [squares] with no details and creates no nice atmosphere around them
> sorta modern
Never understood this
Modernism as a style is at this point pretty darn old, and looks much the same now as it did before
It's not like modern *has* to mean ugly, it's an odd allowance we give these buildings for no reason
100 years ago, many of those other buildings everyone likes were modern
Today, being abstractly "modern" is all they have going for them
I don't love it, but I don't hate either as it doesn't stick out so much at least
Honestly the American embassy in Copenhagen fits that description, its a block of concrete, no detail, nothing
Most other embassies are in old buildings with charm and details and colour
There is so much shitty stuff around østerport now and it sucks
Yes, of course they do
Not just christianity though, also islam, buddhism etc
I don't see why anyone would want schools not to teach it
Yes
Lots of cultures are based on the religion of that area
In order to understand many of today's international problems and conflicts you need to understand the culture and cause
Hence knowledge about religion is important
What is not important is preaching religion in school - that should be avoided
Yes, it's a private school but not religion based
I'm atheist myself and it annoys the heck out of me
But I can't change it
;-;
Yes, I'm currently in Gymnasium (Danish high school) where we have an obligatory class called Religion on the second year
Though in elementary school it was obligatory to have a class called Kristendom (christianity)
I think some schools have changed the subject to religion instead of only christianity
Yes
It's pretty unbiased and teaches us about all the major religions of the world
The reason: it's something that most people in the world believe in, so it's important for our "dannelse". (not sure what the english translation would be, "shaping us into productive members of society" i guess)
It's compulsory, and so is Ancient Studies, where we learn about ancient statues, epics, poems, etc
Mostly ancient Greece though
Again, it's also a part of the dannelse
I do feel that it’s quite silly that it is a subject that you can have for exams though
I wasn't actually aware you could that
Pretty sure, never went to one though
Tell him that some places we still need to ride horses since we don't have cars, and that electricity is only normal in the bigger cities
Tell him only rich people have microwaves
Well thank you
Hell yeah
Aarhus
Copenhagen is sitting on the edge of our country, so people in Jutland often feels distant to the government
I might be biased as I live here, but I would consider moving the capital to Odense
The reason being its central position
Oh so *that* would destabilize Belgium
Wouldn't Odense make more sense then
Or perhaps Kolding
> Copenhagen is sitting on the edge of our country,
Well that can be mended
The Swedes don't even want Skåne anymore
I would go for Odense only because it’s sits perfectly in the middle
It would also make Fyn more than a speed bump lol
Move it back to Roskilde
Ribe, the oldest still existing town in the country
It's kinda funny
It seems to me that every time British person mention any settlement in the UK larger than 3 houses it's always done with great derision
Do all of you hate everywhere in your country
I don't get it
Amsterdam is already the capital of the Netherlands
Yeah, Copenhagen was once really central, but then we lost Skånelandene to the swedes in the 1600s.
Randers is perhaps the last resort
Any
Other
City
Come on, it doesn't make sense to have the capital in a motorway rest stop
Funny thing is that I’ve only heard Jutland mentioned as “the mainland” in jokes
We do have a lot of jokes about each other
In Copenhagen Jutlanders are called substitute Germans and Zealand is the Devils island in Jutland
Copenhagen was made capital when southern Sweden was part of Denmark, back the Copenhagen would have been close to the center
Oh we do
I think it is just a much a rural/uban divide as a regional divide tho
No, back to Jelling
I agree
Imagine if Randers ruled the nation
It's the capital of the scooter
Næstved it is
So by your logic H.C. Andersen was a product of motorway toilet sex
Would you say that the brits ruined Britain
I mean not really, yeah their dialect is maybe easier to understand, but I also think it depends on who you ask, fx
I am from Jutland so I probably feel less connected to them, compared to someone from Bornholm would
But before the Swedes conquered Skånelandene they were danish, but were assimilated
The city of Lund used to be a important Danish city
Randers might have a bad rep, but it isn't really founded on any sort of truth
It's one of the cities with the best level of integration, lowest level of crimes per capita, and most diversity when it comes to income
It also doesn't have any ghettos and has one of the highest engagement from citizens in their local government
So yeah, imagine if Randers ruled the nation
Well no
Of course not that'd be silly
He'd be the product of side-of-the-dirt-road bush (i.e. the closest thing to a motorway toilet back then) sex
They didn't have motorways in the early 19th century
Or maybe he'd be the product of stagecoach sex
I'm pretty sure they had the room for it
As a Dane, I have no idea what you mean that we think people from there are harder to understand
It's very much the most intelligible dialect for me
I’ve lived there
It’s ok, but some of the stereotypes were also thoroughly confirmed
Not all though, and I think it’s definitely made a huge transformation in recent years
I've lived the first 22 years of my life in Randers and I have no clue what you are on about
Stereotypes can be confirmed for anywhere - I've lived in Copenhagen for 7 years now and have seen a lot of stereotypes confirmed a lot of times
If you look for them, you can always find them
I've lived in Randers for 21 years and never found any of the stereotypes be confirmed any more than I have in other towns - that is to say that some individuals confirm them, and some don't. It depends on where you look
Randers is a city with over 96500 people, obliviously not all of them are going to be uneducated, violent criminals and all wear adidas and listen to techno - and it's unreasonable to assume so
Especially when the numbers speak for themselves
Ah, Niels Ebbesens huset - no it's not a pub, just a regular restuarant formerly called "Niels Ebbesens" after the guy that we have a statue of in the city center (now called Potten og Panden, I believe)
The window open because during the German occupation of the 1340s the main German leader Grev Gert had stationed himself in Randers with all of his men
A bunch of local farmers and knights banned together to try and oust the Germans and the hero Niels Ebbesen killed Grev Gert in his sleep, during a heist to try and take back the city
Local legend is that the building he was killed in was placed where Niels Ebbesenshuset is now, and the room where he was killed is the one the window is open in
Story goes that if you close the window, Grev Gert will burn down the city in anger, since his spirit will be trapped and unable to go to heaven
That part isn't true, of course, but the rest is pretty spot on
I think we’re a bit important, in terms of being very frugal, and with our very developed wind and pharmaceutical sectors
Also, fuck Danske Bank
You create great basketball players, which get noticed
And great people - all slovenians I have met have been amazing
That, but also a lot of tech stuff
Both talent going to the rest of EU, and tech conferences in Portugal
If you guys continue that stuff you’ll be very important going forward
Also, leather
Everyone I know who works in leather says you guys are the best
A lot of companies in the Nordic countries are setting up shop in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, because of your good, well educated and cheap workers
Also, for some reason, a lot of the accounting I’ve had to deal with from danish companies has been outsourced to Estonia
I guess because it’s a lot cheaper, and probably just as good
Every time I visit I see more and more Nordic and international company buildings
So you can’t be that unimportant
We do send the worst trash from my country to Spain every year
Must suck to have to deal with those assholes
On the other hand, you guys need to develop your economy away from tourism, that shits not the same anymore - especially post COVID
We're just clillin' up here on top of Germany
Trying to be the teacher's pet
Occasionally throwing a Margrethe Vestager into the mix

Oh for fucks sake
I think the Irish tax policy is by far the largest impact on the EU ️
Yes
Ecco has a big presence there, to name one ️
The Faeroe Islands too, while Greenland is a part of the OCTs
Like everyone else, I'd say the biggest downside is the wait time, especially with specialist, but they are often very good at trying to be flexible for you, if you ask nicely and they think it's urgent enough
I had some issues with some persistent pain in my uterus and wanted to book an appointment with a gynecologist, but was told they had a 9 week waiting list
At this point I was pretty sure it was something serious, so I asked the receptionist if they had anything else, no matter what time of day I didn't care, which they sadly didn't. However, two days later they got a cancellation, and she called me and told me they could fit me in the day after
So it is possible to move ahead, if they suspect it's serious enough
Also, luckily the Danish government is also willing to foot the bill for operations done at private hospitals, if the waiting list at public hospitals are too long
I got my tonsils removed at a private clinic, where the government paid for everything, since I would have had to wait for ages if I didn't go private
The most cited one is wait lists, but we have to remember that this also applies in the US, difference is there it's the rich who get short wait times and the poor who go completly without
Rather upper middle class-upper class people have slightly longer wait times and give everyone else the chance to get all the healthcare they require
>	Well single payer systems are not really free
You pay for it with taxes
I absolutely hate when people say this
If the word "free" is to have any kind of reasonable meaning, you can't bend it like this
Someone, somewhere *always* pay for something
Is it free to use the roads
No, they were paid for by taxes
Is the Christmas present I got free
No, the giver paid for it
Is it free to call the police and report a crime
Nooo
You paid for it in taxes
Is a walk in nature free
No no
Someone owns the land and has a cost associated with it
Saying free healthcare isn't free is completely arbitrary, and has no place in a rational discussion
In Denmark we have to call lægevagten (loosely translates to doctor on duty) and a doctor or other trained person will determine if you can come to the emergency room
This has have good results
Of course there is still waiting time and sometimes many people but not that many who shouldn't be there
I think most people would consider chest pains an emergency no matter what
In Denmark, stuff like getting a gastric bypass (just the first weird example that came to mind) in public healthcare would take a looong time, a lot of evaluation etc
but in private healthcare, they would basically just do it
The most common type of private healthcare to use are psychologists and psychiatrists
Mental healthcare is unfortunately pretty underfunded so waiting times are often looooong
As in months
>	The gift is free because I put approximately $0 towards that present
A pedantic economist would argue that it isn't free, because it comes with an expectation of reciprocity
>	and I didn't pay to go on the walk either
If its public land you paid for it as much as you paid for the road
>	This isn't a difficult concept
I agree
It's just people like you that wants to make it much more difficult than it actually is
You don't need to explain your position
I understand it perfectly
My problem with it, is that it is arbitrarily applied to healthcare, and that it basically means that the word 'free' no longer has meaning
Lol
You think you overpay for healthcare, but at the same time you believe "free samples" are actually free
You are a riot
Your "free samples" are paid for by the slight increase in price on the product that is earmarked for marketing
The point still stands; You have a completely arbitrary line of what *you* consider free and you can argue either way on each and every example
For instance, most people would say that it is free to drive on public (non-toll) roads
Only a small, particulary pedantic subset of people would claim that it isn't. But for some reason, that subset it bigger when the discussion relates to healthcare
However, when you start with the "hurr durr free healthcare isn't free" in a discussion, you are derailing what we are talking about - the rest of us understand the context
Just like *I* understand that in the context of "Free samples", the samples are *actually* paid for by the consumer
I noticed you didn't comment on how people arbitrarily claim free healthcare isn't free, but free road usage is
>	No I explicitly said people pay for roads
You didn't. Perhaps you think you did, but then it wouldn't be hard to find it, would it
>55 would be "half of the way to three (starting from two) times twenty and five". (2
5\*20+5)
Five and 2½ times twenty (femoghalvtredsindstyve)
You also have *halvannan* in Swedish
Edit:
So it's five plus one-half less than three times twenty
Yeah, if you wanna learn it, you really just need to remember it like you would remember the names of anything else
We’re never told to even try to make sense of it, just memorize it
WE’RE TALKING ABOUT LANGUAGE NOT NUMERALS YOU SVENSKJÄVLAR ;,( wtf
As a Dane learning french in school, I found it almost as weird as the counting system from my own country
Nynorsk - as a Dane
But Norwegian is a cute language
Like puppies
Norway used to have similar numbers
Some places in Norway still say ones before tens
Is it half-trice or half third
Here you can hear the numbers
Yeah, it's the same origin IIRC (from halvsjette, 5½)
40 is also funny in Danish, because the long form is spelled *fyrretyve* (four twenty), but it actually means four tens (like in Swedish and English)
It comes from the Old Norse *fjórir tigir*
Twenty is metric, so sorry guys you are still in the dog house
Actually twenty also means two tens, so it's not that different
You just learn the words
60 = tres
80 = firs
We just never changed the old system
Do you know the Swedish system before femti, sexti, sjuti etc
Really not that hard, no “advanced memorization training” is required
Two milliard three hundred five and half sixty million nine hundred four and half fourty thousand six hundred nine and fours
The only weird numbers are 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 and they’re just part of the vocabulary
After 100 it just becomes the same
>Sooo how do you say 755 278
syv hundred femoghalvtreds tusind to hundred otteoghalvfjerds

Stop stealing our words
He did use half trice in your video
Instead of saying half trice (halvtredje), you could also say one-half less than three
The Finnish Civil War
I know it happened, and i think Mannerheim was important during the war
Honestly the first time i heard about it I was genuinely surprised, firstly that Finland had a civil war and secondly - as someone who knows a lot of history - that I knew nothing of it
I know surprisingly little about my owns countrys history, compared to what I know about pretty much the rest of Europe
Seeing that you mention Ireland, and the fact that you mention the football games against Denmark, I'm assuming you are Irish
I'm Danish, for the record
Yeah, terribly sorry about that, I can imagine it was quite humiliating
Hey, I can't help the fact that we were drawn against each other so many times in a row
Some bookies probably lost quite a bit of money on our draws, that was the most frequent result after all
The 1st of may, labour day
You hang out in a park, drink lots with friends, listen to political speeches, boo at certain politicians, cheer for others, participate in demonstrations in the streets and most importantly, drink yet even more
thats because your entire country has been celebrating my birthday a day late, this entire time
24th in the evening,then 25 or 26 there's a big lunch party thingy
Not by how they look, but i swear i can identify a danish accent (when speaking english) atleast 10km away
Honestly, that woman I would have assumed was Danish - in fact, she looks a lot like [I do] especially when it comes to [facial features]
Woooooow, that guy is spot on
Swedes are the ones with the mullet (actually called Swede-hair in Denmark)
We have a great saying for things, that won't fit: "Well, this fits about as good as the hair on a Swede".
Jack wolfskin is definately how i recoqnize Germans
No no no, swedish is danish but written and pronounced like if it was english
However what i meant was that when danes speak english they pronounce word in a way that only danes pronunce english, while it can be similar to other accents it just somehow screams “danish” to me
Im not dutch in any shape or form, so that's probably why
It’s an 80s thing, but somehow the jokes stuck
Ok svensker
When we are not calling it Swede-hair, it is referred to as Bundesliga-hair
Copenhagen were some sommers it's impossible to even walk on the streets in some areas,
Then there Skagen but that is mostly internal tourist from the rich areas of Copenhagen and is mostly happening in one week
Bornholm Is also quite the tourist hotspot since its the only place in Denmark with cliffs and its also the sunniest place in Denmark, but still the only people coming there are Germans and Danes
The little mermaid in Copenhagen
Like calm down it’s just a freaking statue
Edit: And Nyhavn
Can’t forget that
Copenhagen, and also the west coast is filled with Germans right now
Rådhuspladsen (townhall) most of copenhagen
Tell me if i missed something
Copenhagen is by far the most touristy area in Denmark, besides that, maybe the beaches (we got a lot of those)
Central Copenhagen, so many peolpe going to tivoli, the H C Andersen statue ect
Copenhagen
All these tourists, especially Americans will be like "yeah I visited Denmark it was really nice" and whn yoi ask them whoch places they visited they will just go "all around Copenhagen". As a Jutlander I cringe every time I hear about Americans visiting Denmark
Because they never visit 'Denmark'. They just visit 1 city and are amazed by people on bikes
>Copenhagen
I feel like Nyhavn is in every Instagram ever
Don´t forget the western coast of Jutland where Danes, Germans and Norwegians vacate in droves
Its e beautiful part of the country but the tourist infrastructure isn't always pretty
Nah, Denmark and the nature here can be lovely
Depends what you want
There are no mountains, but we have a unique coastline, and areas around Silkeborg and Rebild respectively are very pretty
Expensive yes, but boring its not
Depends on what kind of tourist you are if all you wanna do is lie down on the beach in 30 degrees Celsius then Denmark is definitely not the place for you since we tend to have quite shitty weather
I know some of them, but not all
Then again, I know some of the German states or UK counties as well  it isn't something we are taught, as we don't have much use for knowing them, just like you, in the US, don't have much use for knowing the Danish kommuner or German bundesstaat
Like it's good to be aware of them and know the big ones, but the rest you can research if you need
Most US i would probably recognise when I heard then though, so there would be no need to clarify
But, tbh, people probably already knew you were from the US the moment you spoke, just like they would for any other English-speaking country
What throws me every time is the abbreviations
Sure some of them I can guess me way through, but in general it annoys me when people from the US uses them in international groups and then get mad if you ask for clarification
But that's a whole other ballpark
I think a lot of people could name at least the important ones (Texas, California, New York, Florida and following the 2020 election maybe Nevada and Georgia as well)
I think I know all the states by name(nevermind 34), but I have a hard time finding then on a map expect for the famous ones, Midwest and the north/south states
I know a few, including Minnesota, but still find it annoying as fuck when Americans assume I know various things about their federal states and their inane abbreviations
I don't know what Minnesota's abbreviation is, or what minutes details you pretend makes it different from the rest and I don't really care to
Please don't introduce yourself as being from a specific federal state before the country though
If I cared what street you grew up on I'd ask
I think most have heard of basically all the states particulalry the ones by the east and west coast
Now if you would ask them to name the cities or point them out on a map i think many would have a hard time particularly with all those rectangular states in the middle
I recently took one of those geography tests
To compare I got 92% with Europe getting a mistake in Balkan
All of South America  correct, but only able to place 50% of the US states correctly
We know the names of the states and their approximately  location but the midwest and North east can be quite hard to perfectly pinpoint
Capitals are only really known in the biggest states
One of my friends posted this quiz on Facebook
It about naming all the states in 10 minutes or less
It took me a few tries (or around 40), but ultimately I got it
I have a feeling many would just assume it's American, so if you said I'm from Victoria, Ontario or  Queensland, they'd know it's not in the UK, so
USA, maybe
Outside their cars, I don't really see German write DE everywhere
It certainly isn't like in the US where the abbreviations will be an answer to when asked where they are from
Literally today I was in an international group someone answered "PA", no other context at all, to a question about where people are from
And then got annoyed with people when they asked what he meant, or whether he was from Panama
That's the sort of issue what I was referring to
I run into it almost weekly
I mean, I'm just lazy, the only language I *tried* to learn was Dutch, but as I said, I'm lazy, so I just stopped ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
This, all of this

Language learning depends so much on your native language and what other languages you know
Also, have you considered Finnish, Hungarian, or literally any of the Slavic languages with 5-8 cases
Yep
i dont think i could name more than a few countries outside of Europe that i'd actually consider living in
One being Canada, and the other being South Korea
I am not the biggest fan of the EU
Me too

That WIFI and cellular is bad for you - which is also why there’s some pushback when it comes to 5G.
That the medicinal industry is out here trying to get all your money, and that they work with doctors who will tell you you’re sick, and prescribe meds instead of telling you to eat healthy
That diet, vitamins and/or oils can cure (almost) all diseases/illnesses

Cancer
Eat fish oil
That microwaves and phones give you cancer unless you put a small sticker on your phone, that you bought from an obscure health website

They mean well though
Our anti-vaxxers have a special fixation on the [HPV vaccine]
A few years ago a 'documentary' claimed al sort of nonsense and the mass hysteria spread

My mom gets so offended when I refuse her homeopathic bullcrap
According to her I should respect it, at least for the placebo effect
But I think it’s borderline dangerous to rely on these things
When you try some bullshit water and sugar pills for a few weeks instead of going to the doctor, you might actually make it worse
She also keeps sending me articles about how dangerous my actual meds are
One was about ibuprofen
What kills me is that, honestly, it's the rational thing to do in that situation, right
Sheesh
Sorry, I know I'm late to the party
I had this tab open in my browser for a while
I pretty much never uses it because it's terrible
The English language one I use *all the time*.
I will literally use the English wikipedia for Danish things sometimes because the Danish one really sucks
The danish one really is quite for almost all bigger things, and even for a lot of small things
I’ll always start off on danish wikipedia to get a sense of the topic and such, and if i need more info i’ll switch to english
Starting in danish makes it a lot easier for me to grasp what the article is about, especially if it uses concepts and names which i’m usually more familiar with in danish
Honestly, I use the Danish wiki most of the time
I only switch over to the English wiki if it is a little more obscure subject
I prefer the English one, English has kind of become my "online" language, I prefer it over Danish whenever I am online
Sometimes I feel like the English wiki offer more information, I do use the Danish on occasion when I am reading about something very specifically Danish
I use it depending on the article as for most subjects they provide a comment on how whatever it was affected Denmark
Though most articles are just plain more informative in English
I only ever use the Danish Wikipedia if the subject is Danish
The Danish Wikipedia has few articles, which isn't great, but what's worse is how lacking the ones that are there are
What's even the point of reading the three sentence article, when I'm going to have to go to the English article afterwards
I thought that was kinda weird, until I realised I have done the same with reading an article in bokmål if there weren't a Danish one
Drinking tap water is perfectly normal
Drinking bottled water is seen as bad for the environment and a waste of money
In some supermarkets you can buy an empty bottle and fill it from a tap, also in the supermarket: [Example]
Totally normal here, but the tap water from Copenhagen are a lot harder so some people would buy bottled water and store it, but only if it's on sale at your local Rema1000
So it's more of an option the anything
Yes
Our toilet water is so clean that you can drink it
Yes very normal here in Denmark and it is delicious
But more and more water wells have the past years been tested positive for pesticides and E. coli bacteria
So it's probably something we have to get used to in the future
:-/
Sparkling water tastes like TV Static
>The “exclusive” and expensive Voss water
Never heard of it
Polluted wells are closed
We have no 5G here and people are still dying of covid-19
Beggars are banned in all of Denmark
In Asia the stray dogs are pretty chill, never seen an aggressive one
I think they just killed all the vile dogs back in the days
I just realised this saying rhymes in swedish
We have it in Denmark too, it's just not a very good saying
It's say, they've never been in a tropical hurricane
no clothes' gonna help ya
I really like the cold, I love snow, I am going to miss it since it kinda seems like inevitable and it makes me so sad that even though I try myself so hard even by donating money to causes and keep recycling and telling everyone I know about it being a serious thing now, things only will get worse
We are
Isn’t that only the Czech Republic
It's literally a problem for immigrants in the Scandinavian countries, that natives won't let them try and speak Danish/Swedish/Norwegian to them - it's part of the reason why a large amount of our expats never bother to learn our languages
Why bother when natives won't let you use it anyway
The moment you try in the native, they'll simply reply in English
I'm a teacher in Danish as a foreign language for expats, and I have students who are extremely good at Danish, and can basically have full on conversations lasting hours, yet have an accent so Danes will simply reply to them in English no matter what
It's such a huge problem that it's even part of our official teaching material - included in small texts they read, or lessons dedicated to learning how to ask Danish people to please speak to them in Danish
I'm aware they face the same issues in Sweden and Norway, according to the teacher of our company's branches there
I had a student who one day came and asked me if he was someone was saying "a coffee, please" wrong, since baristas would always reply to him in English after he said it
His Danish was perfect and that's an extremely simple sentence to say, but he had an accent so people would never allow him to use it
It's certainly-- challenging
Learning to read it is easy enough, learning to speak it is a whole other ball game
The first challenge of my lessons will always be getting my students to pronounce my name correctly (especially because they'll have seen it written on their schedule before starting, so most will assume it's pronounce like most languages would)
Honestly none, but it makes sense as I'm a huge geography nerd when it comes to anything on a map, but the Romanian cities aren't the only one I would have a little trouble pointing out their exact location within their borders
Same for me, I thought I'd make it further down the list, but I've honestly never heard of Zaragoza
Whenever I see a German city name I dont recognise I just assume it's part of the [Ruhr area]
Really
Torino
It's just the English name for it
Juventus FC and Torino FC are both football clubs from there, and I would guess that even non-football-fanatics have heard of Juventus at least
For some words with difficult pronunciations like "brød", it helps to pretend you are puking
At least that is what the exchange students here do
Unless you're from Sweden or Norway, perhaps Germany or France, don't expect to ever sound Danish, maybe your grandkids will accomplish that
Learn the basics of H, D, I and ÆØÅ
Verbs *always* end with an "r" in present tense if they end with an "e" in infinitive - the so-called "nutids-r". Even if you cannot hear the r when you say the word out loud (which is the case with verbs such as "høre - hører" and "lære - lærer"), you still need to add it
If you get your nutids-rs right, you'll have learned something that the majority of native speakers haven't managed to learn
Even Danes have it tough with genders
We don’t use genders at all
Also be prepared to let the r be a growl and to stick your tongue out for the d in brød. Brød is horrible word for foreigners
I've found that my mates from france have had a really easy time learning the pronounciation of the words
My mate who came here this last summer could say "rødgrød med fløde" after 5 minutes
Pathetic, Danish has 32, but only 9 symbols for vowels (a, e, y, u, i, o, æ, ø, and å) and some local dialects have more
Danish genders are such a mess that at least one dialect has reassigned the genders of a huge part of the words
It also has the [Danish stød] on top of the soft d's, which is also terrible for foreigners to pronounce
That just makes it easier, you actually know what sounds to make
I still don't know how to say kamelåså
Hating the "It's 3am why are you still awake" memes posted by Americans while it's 8am here

At least some loanwords from indo-european languages
Also it depends on how far east you count Europe (or south for that matter)
I haven't encountered the idea outside reddit
People don't even want the Euro up here
Not in Danish

Googled it, that entire party currently has a total of 59 people who has given their signature for them to run at our next election, which probably goes a long way to explain why I hadn't heard of them until now
In Denmark we say,"were you born in a tent
Or: "were you born in an S-train
What are some off the most weirdest laws in your country
Well there's this law, that I dont know if its still in effect but nonetheless
It basically said that if a Dane sees a swedish person walking over the frozen Øresund, then that dane can freely walk over to that said dane and beat him with a stick, free of charge
It’s okay I have learned something new
So I see it as an absolute win
Denmark has it as well - there used to be two different rates, one for radio only, and one for radio and tv
Then they changed the rules, and you had to pay if you had an internet connection as well, since you could access the public radio/tv station through that as well
It has now changed again, and is done through normal taxation
Before that, there would be people driving around knocking on doors asking people who didn't pay if they had a TV in the house
Ow I have actually heard of this law in a tv show about someone who sailed from Denmark to Svalbard
The Electoral College is workong as intended (other than faithless electors), the weird thing is the overreach of the federal government
Definitely not
In the word "hvis" we don't pronounce the "h". There are several other examples of this occurrence
"Lære" (to teach) and "lærer" (teaches) is pronounced almost the same
A lot of our verbs are the same way
We have several "blunt D's" which are D's you can't hear
Basically spelling is a shit show
In Danish there are three ekstra letters: Æ, Ø, Å, each with destinct sounds, which we use I many words but we don't really ever use the letters, it can be confusing
Haha
(I wish
I envy the languages that actually make sense)
Basically the only words spelled as they sound are ø and å.
Don’t forget about the vowels changing sound in different words
Eks:
Emil: E sounds like e and I sounds like I
Rikke: E sounds like Ø and I sound like A
... I feel sorry for foreigners learning Danish
Og "i"
This is due to the fact, that we simply don't have enough letters to properly represent all the vowel sounds in Danish
I think outside of a language spoken by 30 000 people in the Caucasus Mountains and maybe another equally small language, Danish has the most vowel sounds, with like 25-30 different vowel sounds(There are 4-5 different ways to pronounce A)
Untill we get more letters in the alphabet, we are stuck with this
That's the case for other words ending in "ag" as well
Other examples include: flag (flay) flagstang (flaostang)
But the question is then, why didn't the Irish alphabet just adopt those letters
It seems pretty bizarre to use a digraph, when a perfectly good and widely used letter exists, and it isn't already in use in the alphabet
> You're completely right
I find many similarities between the Irish and Icelandic alphabets
To outsiders, they seem like there's no logic with them
Apart from -ll, what things do you think are out of the ordinary in Icelandic
To a Scandinavian, Icelandic spelling makes perfect sense
This just opens up for so many more questions though
But I still have virtually no idea how that would be pronounced, due to Irish following completely different orthographic rules from other languages
Is C a C? Or is it pronounced like, for example, a P?
I'm not even Polish, but if you started to write Krakuw and Tarnuw for example, sure that's how they are pronounced anyway, but it just looks too wrong
The Irish-English animosity was not one of the questions, that arose though
It was more, why letters like J and V were seen as English, when they are common in most other European languages, especially since O, I, C, A, E, H, etc
are considered alright
What I am going at, is that Irish orthography is pretty unique in its fairly liberal use of digraphs and trigraphs, which makes it fairly indecipherable by an outsider, and some of them are fairly funky, like how mh is a v sound and bh can be a w sound
As an example, I am pretty sure most people who's only prerequisite would be knowing the Latin alphabet, would have an easier time reading and reproducing Malaysian or Hausa than Irish
"Jeg skal lige en tur lige på det lille hus" - "I have to go to the little house", is a polite way of saying that you need to the toilet
In general most of course just say WC or toilet
More "fun" terms are: "det lille hus" (the small house), "potten" (the pot), "tronen" (the throne), and then a bunch of crude terms for what you actually do out there ;)
The little house - det lille hus
The barrol - tønden
You would say, I need to go on/to the barrol - jeg skal på tønden
Det lille hus (the little house)
My dad calls it "skidderen" which pretty much means "the shitter"
"Answering a call of nature" means to go to the toilet in English as well
The barrol, also used quite alot
If it fits it sits
What word/saying do you like to make foreigners try to pronounce in your language
In Denmark it’s a major meme how we always go “try to say rød grød med fløde
” when meeting a foreigner
It contains both the soft D and the Ø, both of which are challenging to pronounce for most people
I also sometimes try to make foreigners say "røget ørred i Rødovre" ("smoked trout in Rødovre", which is a city outside of Copenhagen)
It's got soft D and Ø as well, but it's also got the weird G  that sounds like a J in røget and the weird R's in ørred, which makes it sound like we are gargling more than speaking a language
If it’s just a singular word I want someone to try and pronounce then it’s “Æblegrød”. It has both the Æ and the Ø. Translates to Apple Porridge
Not even saying this to hate on you, but the Swedish 'sju'-syllable is the ugliest sound in existence
And then he said “Danish sounds like someone is speaking with a potato in their mouth”.
Funniest shit I’ve ever seen
Hmm
Seems like it would just be pronounced kyriø
I’ll do you better, THR
Fuck I hated saying “three”
As someone learning Spanish: where
Which words
My life is a lie
“Hard” when it comes to languages is basically just code word for “my native language doesn’t have it or anything similar to it”. How hard a language is depends a lot on your native language
The D in Ciudad doesn’t at all sound the same as in fløde, but I digress
My Spanish teacher is Chilean and they’re apparently hard to understand for other Spanish speakers
We just use their names
We don't have words like that
It's certainly not the norm
We usually use the english words (dude, bro, y'all) but "gutter" or "folkens" are common too
I mean in general, I don't think we are a country big on any type of nicknames
Be it for the individual person or a group
But as a woman, I might call my female friends "tøser", "de damer" or even a cheeky "gutter", though those hardly seem like slang names
Disagree
Bro, makker, gutter and simply "drengene" are very common
I very much disagree with you
I'm 20 for context
That's... not true
We've got bror, bro (from English), brormand, makker, kammerat, fyr, gut, and søs, tøser, all of which are used often
Also teenagers often call their friend group “holdet”, the team
My dad calls his friends “drengene”, the boys
Same and I'm 43
Other people have said the same, but a lot of people clearly agree with me as well
I think this is a regional difference
Nobody says *brorsan* anymore
God no
Not at all - Tøser literally just means girls
It would be like saying "chicks" or "birds" in English, though slightly less slangish as tøs is a little old-fashioned and I think originally it was literally the word for a female who was in between being a "pige" (girl) and "kvinde" (woman)
It just seems odd to me that there would be some region of Denmark where all of these were absent
I live in Aarhus, grew up north of Copenhagen, and have family in Sønderjylland, and everyone I know from all three places uses these words frequently
And I've lived in several places in Nordjylland and have never heard anyone call each other by those names, except for tøser like once or twice
And granted, asking my few friends is not a very big group to go on, but none of them have either
According to my dictionary from when I was learning German "tussen" in German is the same "luder" in Danish, which means whore or "kælling" which is an old word for "old woman" which now means something more in the line of "bitch". Tøs, in general, is always either positive (often used by adults to girls/women or between girls themselves as an endearing term for a person who is young and female) or neutral
My Aalborg friends jokingly use ‘drengeren’ all the time
We actually used the term "tysker tøs" as well, but it's only that entire term that's negative in Denmark, not the term "tøs" in general
There is said to be a lake in Sweden shaped like the Danish island of Sjælland (where Copenhagen is located)
The norse godess of wisdom, Gefion, wanted more land for Denmark
She asked the king of Sweden for land, he said no
Then she slept with him and he said yes, you can get all the land you can plough in one night
Gefion turned her sons into oxens and ploughed out Sjælland
There is a giant [statue] of her in Copenhagen
It's said that the island of Sjælland was created when a giant took a piece of Sweden and cast it into the ocean
The lake where he took the dirt from is now where the Vänern is today
A sailor was at sea when suddenly his ship sank,
the cause is said to be a meteorite
He woke up on a coast alone, all his crewmembers drowned
A virgin tribal woman found him and he followed, but her intentions were not good
She cut off his penis and ate it, and proceeded to boil him in a big pot
This is the sad story of Skipper Bent
somwhat Denmark
What do you mean by that
No idea tbh, it might not even exist
That's absolutely not true at all - almost all Norse Mythology is found in Iceland there's absolutely no sources that indicate that norse mythology is any more from Sweden and Norway than Denmark
Couldn’t they be mixed up so two countries had slightly different myths about the same lakes
As someone with a masters degree in History: you are remembering wrong
Wasn't he also partially eaten
Not my country, but I did live there for a while in the early 90s so
Russians eat ice cream all year round
-10 degrees and winter
Watch people queue up when some ice cream vendor sets up show at a corner and starts selling Пломбир for a decently low price
I found it weird at first, but after a little while I got into it too, and now my wife calls me odd when we're taking a winter walk, and I get a craving for a cone
Well
thanks
If Sweden is ever invaded, I promise I will make plans to liberate you guys, and tell you about them after the war is over
Well, we appreciate the efforts anyways

I really want to go there again
It's basically a drinking contest at this point
The question is, if we can handle their whisky better than they can handle our snaps
I would prefer we just split the island down the middle
That way, we can both have a 2nd land border and go visit each other
At the moment, we both just have a single land border to the south
Nice - we still have the 50øre here in Denmark, but it's pretty useless
I don't think it will be long before we get rid of that as well

This is simiar to what scouts is in Denmark
We have the option of boy and girl scouts up until 2002-ish
(I was in the last girl scouts group in Denmark, and I believe it closed down around this time), but ever since then, it's been mixed and it's like the scouts described above
I remember learning how to set a tent, wield a knife, catch and prepare a fish as well as just having fun and hanging out outside
Don't we still have girl scouts
Because a couple of years ago there were something about the group I'm in of buying one of their huts
I believe they're called "De grønne pigespejdere", and it seems (with some quick googling) like they still have ~120 groups
There are definitely still girl scouts in Denmark
Det Danske Spejderkorps are predominantly mixed, but there are a few girl scout (and boy scout) groups e.g. Broager Pigespejder in Southern Jutland
As I wrote above, I might be misremembering, as I was a child at the time, plus it was ages ago, so honestly, a lot can have changed
But the story was De Danske Pigerspejdere merged with the boys in the 70s, and only a few select pure girl groups (no matter the age group) existed since then, and by the time I started our group was the last group left
They then closed a few years after I stopped being a scout
It is worth noting there's a clear difference between Green and Blue scouts
Honestly, a lot of Blue don't even consider Green scouts to be "real scots", as they are first and foremost a religious group, not a scout group (plus a whole lot of other political and rivalry stuff that I honestly never was old enough to care about when I was in scouts - all I know is that my blue-scout friends still turn red in the face when people mention green scouts and vice versa)
We were told that we were the last ones that were 100% girl no matter the age, that's all I know, but like I said, I was a child and this is way over 10 years ago, so my memory might be faulty - but my mum even stayed on the DDS board for longer than I was a spejder (two years extra I think, she still complains about it) because it was closing down due to lack of attendence and several parents worked hard to keep it open, so to keep the final pure DDS girl scouts open
Last I heard, that group closed and the final none-religious Girl Scouts group was "dead". But like I said, I was a child, so there might be some nuances I misremember or misunderstood
It's true that there's a difference between KFUM (green) and DDS (blue)
As I am blue scout myself, I know that we don't like being called green scouts, and vice versa
But from my personal experiences, I would say that it is nothing more than a joke, a friendly rivalry
Where we accept each others as scouts, just not openly
And while it's true that while there have been noticeable difference between KFUM and DDS
From what I know we do mostly the same things, as I am friends with with a couple of green scouts they aren't much of a "Christian society" anymore
And there's 1 point that both green and blue scouts agree on, and that is that FDF aren't real scouts
Denmark was 100% made of off germanic tribes, so no actual ruins, but there has been found some ancient roman potter (especially interesting to find some terra sigillata, as it was very precious)
And there's also a site, where the first villages, where there was a clear house size difference was found - which is believed to be the first "king" or at least tribe leader, who had the domination over more land, which is believed to be directly affected by a roman friendship, when the Romans still had their kinda friendly foreign policy
That's a Danish Summer
"Abandon all hope, ye who enter here"
..also it's cold, snowy, and Vikingy
2018 was the hottest summer i've ever experienced
All the grass died and turned yellow, it looked like a savannah
And it was followed by the coldest winter i've ever experienced
It was a crazy year for the weather
[Suspekt - Kinky Fætter]
The song title translates to "Kinky cousin". The song is overly explicit (the chorus is literally a girl moaning) which is why many people enjoy listening to it at partys, but I personally enjoy it for all the other reasons
The intro has a cool violin build up, the flow is really good and the lyrics are so in your face with a lot of attitude, which I like
[Hun er min Volvo B18
210
This is played a most parties here and people love it
[Lars Lilholt - Hvidsten Kro]
This guy makes all these folksy songs that really isn't something I enjoy listening to, however this particular song has struck a chord with me because of the subject he sings about
The Hvidsten group was a group of Danish resistance fighters during the occupation by the germans in world war 2
They were a bunch of regular guys, lead by Marius Fiil, the innkeeper of Hvidsten Inn
Their role was to pick up agents and/or weapons dropped via parachute by the RAF and distribute them to the various sabotage groups in the country
They were active for about a year until one agent got caught and tortured by the germans and he revealed the entire group who was subsequently arrested, tried and executed
I love this song because it does a good job in telling their story
Probably Scarlet Pleasure - Deja Vu
They're a pretty popular Danish band, but mostly popular with 14 year old girls, so I'm not really the stereotypical listener, being a 19 year old guy
But they're real funky, it's a they're not international known
this song is actually amazing, and the lyrics are just so
wholesome
Definitely a banger
When Suspekt is giving concerts, this song is of course one of their main hits, and the lyric (or chant) is added to the instrumental part of the chorus "Jeg har kneppet til den her sang" (literally: "I've shagged to this song / while this song was playing)
Always gets the crowd riled up of course
That the weather an interesting topic for conversation and that Denmark has the best educational system and the funniest humor in the world
Our healthcare system is good
That’s about it I think
Derry Girls is absolutely one of the best shows I've watched recently
I binged the shit out of it and the recommended it to all my friends, haha
And cheese
And wine
Pretty normal when you eat them
Us too
Us too
I know
Except for Norway
We might be
It's sunny today, but not as much as yesterday
But it's nice that the raining stopped
Tomorrow should be cloudy
If thats true than skåne is a part of Denmark
I like Italian wine best
But I thought the French would all agree they have the best wine
Everybody knows that your educational system rocks
Except Danes, who like to think that we are number one there
Amen brother
If someone from Denmark tries to speak english, then it's very obvious that they're danish, especially if they are from an older generation
I don't know what it is, but I think it's just a heavy accent that carries over
Yep
Hej and hi sounds too familiar
Reddit actually does have profile pictures since the redesign
Just hover over someones name for it to appear
No-one uses them though, for obvious reasons
Where i live, if they knock and you are not at home, the package will return to a posthouse and you can pick it up there
Also you can send your package to f.x a supermarket and you can pick it up there
The most effective Swedish invasion of Denmark must the the fact that we have Postnord now
Pain and suffering
Honestly it's a lot better than when we had Postdanmark
For the last two years I haven't had nearly the same problems as with Postdanmark in the past or GLS now
It probably is
Our former government spent a decade trying to "improve effectiveness" in Post Danmark, by reducing budgets and laying off anyone with a long employment history
Meanwhile income from mail itself went down and private package delivery companies snapped up the profitable and easy-to-handle small packages
The only reason Post Denmark didn't go bankrupt bankrupt was probably because it couldn't be allowed to stop functioning
Overall I'd say Post Denmark was the victim of classic "New Public Management", just like the British NHS
I wouldn't say that's how they present it in Denmark atleast not in media
We had PostDanmark before which while it wasn't great was better than what service is now being provided
And you are right in the understanding that it's mostly digital here, we have E-Boks to receive pretty much any information from the government or other government related institutions
I've pretty much given up on Postnord personally at this point
I'd rather pay slightly more for GLS or something equivalent to that to make sure the service is good
Here Postnord as only delivery option is usually a reason to pick another webshop
"Mørke" in Denmark
(Mørke means Darkness)
Bradford, England
East Berlin
I would imagine Kaliningrad
Tiraspol in Transnistria
Well Chisinau was really uninteresting culture wise
It's not for nothing that moldova is the least visited country in Europe
This
All cities are special in their own way
I was about to say Warsaw because of the kind of bland architecture there, But then I then it occurred to me that i distinctively remember Warsaw because of the Soviet vibe that I got when I was there, which was really interesting
It's long been considered a Ghost Town
The first picture in the Imgur gallery you linked [here] genuinely looks like an art cover for a dystopian game/book
Can confirm
Was there on Interrail
It's god some old buildings just like any other European city but nothing that interesting
I did however try an amazing burger in hipster burger joint
One of the best burgers I ever had
*aaaaaall the clubs have been clooooooosed down*
I think gentrification has been a larger problem for Amsterdam
A lot of the neighbourhoods in the surrounding areas of the city center don’t have a lot of uniqueness to them
My dads from around there
I think it has something to do with the dark architecture, dark monotone rows of houses
Not to mention the fact that the weather is often gloomy
Oh and crime, frankly
There's plenty of those situations in Danish, but the first two pairs that spring to mind are:
*Mord* and *mor* \- meaning murder and mum
To make it even harder, the d in *mord* is silent
and one where there's not even a difference in spelling, simply in pronunciation
*Dør* and *dør* \- meaning to die or door
in danish some words are spelled the exact same way but have different meanings, like dør(door) and dør(dying)
vildt sådan at komplimentere den også. Det eneste sted jeg har prøvet det er ved gynækolog
In Denmark uni is free and you also get up to roughly 800€ a month by the government for studying
Universities are free in Denmark which also applies to EU citizens
That said, many courses are taught in Danish on both bachelor and master level which probably would limit your choice by a lot - especially since you need to speak Danish to actually apply to those courses
Though if you do that you can apply for something called SU which essentially is a government subsidy for students which can cover most student housing offers, basic food options and so on
You won't get rich but you will get by
But if you're not from the EU then it will cost money each semester
I'm not sure about the prices for that
Non-EU/EEA:
**Annual tuition fees for full-degree students**
USD 8,000-21,000 / Euro 6,000-16,000 (DKK 45,000-120,000)
Scholarships and grant are possible:
For international students there are some extra rules to be able to get the 800€ a month, like you have to work 10-12 hours a week
Just make something clear:
This do only applies for EU or EEA citizens - for Non-EU and Non-EEA citizens you can not get the money from the government or study for free
Not a loan, yours to keep
It's pretty average for students to work about 15hours a week, besides study during uni time
You can supliment with a low interest loan every month if you should need a little extra
No, none of it is a loan
But you can get a low interest loan in addition to it
No, you don't have to pay back anything
If live at home you get ~$130-800 depending on your parents’ income
Yes, for EU citizens there are a few more rules, like you have to work 10-12 hours a week
Theres a way for non citizens to get it, I think you have to work 10 hours a week but I could be wrong
And you need to apply residence permit and a lot of other fun stuff, if you are not from an EU or EEA county
I think anyone knows that they need a study visa or other visa to be able to study when they are not from a EU or EEA country
You did just make it sound like anyone could get SU by saying "international students" where it is EU and EEA citizens that only can that
I will just add that the maximum for living at home is €361
(This is what I'm currently getting, and I'm living at home with my mom who has a low income)
Let me save you the trobule and just give you the site with all of the information:
not anymore, but you do have to work at least a few hours a week to get it
You are right, I’m just so used to call them international students since that is what they are called at my university
Oh, i thought it was closer to the living alone SU
Phone services and internet*
I pay around 15€ for super phone service, lots of data, free roaming etc
9€ for high speed internet
*Relative to income
Bread, cake, beer, internet and heat
One of the greatest things about being in Romania in the summer is the abundance of basically free watermelon
There's a guy who recently opened a few coffee houses here, who wanted to go against the trend of coffee being obscenely expensive
No matter which coffee you get, it's 10kr(1,4€), which is at least a fourth of what other places charge
Business seems to be going fine
I once visited a restaurant in an industrial area outside of Bergamo many years ago
All the way untill the bill was handed to me, I was convinced in the menu, that the prices per pizza was 1 euro
10kr
Damn, that's cheap, I could actually see myself becoming a regular there
I like the idea of cafés, but they're, as you mentioned, obscenely expensive here, so I just don't go to any
There's 2 in Copenhagen already selling for 15 and 20 kr
, I was happy to discover the 20 kr
one by accident
Cloetta chocolate bar with Gott & Blandat in it
Love it
[It's very new, but judging from the fact that they only started half a year ago or so] I guess it won't be long untill we see locations in the rest of the country
>  in regular supermarkets was Moldova, but they have lower incomes so it would be more as a %)
If they want cheap wine, they make it themselves
I HATE them
Especially at night
I am really uncomfortable with them
Tbh I am scared of thunder
Yes, even if I am outside
They’ll never find me alive
If you break something, you lay waste to it:
Break -> Ødelægge -> Øde (Waste/Empty) & lægge (lay)
If you destroy something, you reduce it to nothing:
Destroy -> Tilintetgøre -> Til (to) & intet (nothing) & gøre (do/make)
Vacuum Cleaner - Støvsuger - Dustsucker
Tu me fais chier = you're making me shit (you're annoying me)
Same in Danish except the second one
Dutch sounds like a German trying to speak Danish
I don’t know, I don’t really think we have a word for it
That whole area is just brystvorte
Hej, mit navn er John, det er en fornøjelse at møde dig
Hvor er du fra
Hi, my name is John, it is a pleasure to meet you
Where are you from
Danish and english are quite similar
Here's a Danish translation of your example:
Hej, jeg hedder John, det glæder mig at møde dig
Hvor er du fra
Hello, I named John, it happies me to meet you
Where are you from
Though, this is a really boring example to showcase how Danish differs from English
Here's a better one:
(When I arrived at the station, I noticed that I hadn't gotten off at the right place)
Da jeg ankom på stationen, bemærkede jeg, at jeg ikke var stået af det rigtige sted
When I arrived at station-the, noticed I that I not was stood off the right place
Hej, jeg hedder John, det er en fornøjelse at møde dig
Hvor er du fra
Hej, I called John, it is a pleasure to meet you
Where are you from
Hej mit navn er John, det er en fornøjelse at møde dig
Hvor kommer du fra
Hi my name is John it is a pleasure to meet you
Where coming you from
It works not with all sentences
If I begun to talk like here, would it be easy enough to understand me, but it would not be completely perfect
Hej
Mit navn er John
Det er rart at møde dig
Hvor er du fra
Hi, My name is John, it is nice to meet you, where are you from
For Denmark the most dangerous animal would be the Wasp
Statistically responsible for 1-2 deaths each year
If you mean "If I encounter this animal I'm in danger
" it would probably be the wolf, but those are very few in numbers and generally flee from humans
cats are dangerously cute
(on a serious note, probably ticks
Me: dad, what's the most dangerous animal in denmark
My dad: kids
Thanks dad
I actually thought the European adder (hugorm in Danish) would be on the list as well, but the last time a healthy adult in Scandinavia died from a bite, was in 1994 in Sweden
TBE is spreading among ticks in Denmark at the moment, so it's not just Lyme disease we need to worry about there anymore
As far as I can see, there haven't been any deaths yet though
I was thinking maybe the adder as well - though only 7 people have died from it since 1900, around 400 do get bitten every year and 70 of those have to stay at hospital for treatment
Also maybe the tick - around 300 people every year get seriously ill from tick-bites
Snake is slange in Danish, and orm is generally considered to apply to worm :) but orm actually means any long creature without legs (including worms, snakes, dragons, you name it)
For exampel Midgårdsormen is the Danish name for Jörmungandr
My favourite from my time was during an exercise one of our guys had night watch and while he was sitting there he noticed someone in the woods
As he shouts the “password” the guy is spooked and fall into a small stream
Because of this he doesn’t reply to the shouting of my mate, so he opens fire
Turns out it was our platoon leader out for a piss
A day later on the same exercise we accidentally scared the shit out of an old couple and their dog began running around our camp barking, not very ideal for staying hidden
If you can talk the Czechs into paying us Danegeld to stay away we'd gladly go drink somewhere else
But you took your sweet time getting rid of us
Maybe we can put our flags together and tell Norway to join in on the fun Kalmarunionen skal leve
Lets just plant scandinavian flags everywhere
The more the merrier, yes
Let's have the English pay Danegeld again
In Denmark er have a "statsminister" which is translated to Prime Minister
However,we have minesterial posts, which are ministers who focus on specific things, such as economics, culture, integration, among a lot of other things
In total, excluding the prime minister, we have 19 ministers
They work under the prime minister
Doing his best to emulate Putin
The public busses have a European flag on the roof
But i think if you asked 10 people on the day why, less than half would be able to tell you
You need a permit to raise another countrys national flag, except the other Nordic countries or the EU or UN flag
So no Estonian flags
Like this :-)
Those two flags are pretty much a prime example of the "Can I copy your homework
" meme
Thats wrong
It is worded weird so i get how machine translation would get that impression, but the  Greenlandic flag, the Faroese flag, the Nordic countries' flags, the UN flag and the EU flag are also allowed
Not just on poles but publicly
Its an old law to prevent the English from bombing random Danish towns when they saw a German Flag
You can use flags for non national things though, like the gay flag
No problem indoors
I actually used to have a big Stars & Stripes hanging over my gun cabinet so it couldn't be seen from the outside through the window
You could, but it's doubtful that it would actually happen
If someone informed the police, they might stop by to earn their pay check, but it's rather unlikely if you did it on one day
Some people did fly the Stars and Stripes on their flag pole regularly, and they were asked to take it down, because they didn't have permission to do it
Olsen banden (Denmark)
Pepole serm to recomend alot of serious film
This is a comedy movie about a heist
The hunt
Mads mikkelsen nailed it like jesus on the cross
Adams Æbler (Adams apples) is excellent
From Denmark, i'd nominate these:
Pusher (1996)
Jagten (the hunt) (2012)
Blinkende lygter (Flickering Lights) (2000)
Coincidentally all the movies feature Mads Mikkelsen, though he only has a lead role in "The Hunt"
These are all different genres
Watch all 14 Olsen Banden movies
Adam's Apples for Denmark
A dark comedy sort of in the vein of In Bruges
These movies are actually moderately popular in Poland
I have seen Polish dubbed Gang Olsena dvds in Polish supermarkets several times
They were some of the only western movies allowed during the communist era
Hvad med alle Olsen Banden filmene istedet
I second Utøya
One of the most intense cinema experiences I ever had
If you're going to see it make sure that there are no dstractions so that you can fully emerge yourself in it
All the movies you mentioned are great, but this one is the most is the one that left the biggest impression with me
>Kriget (Denmark)
Krigen\*
Does it have anything with the band in it
You misspelled inferior
Because Bergman is one of the greatest directors of all time
> It is about a bunch of guys who live in southern Sweden that enjoy playing football and going to Denmark to beat UP danes
That sure sounds like something a Swede would do
I didn't even know there is a Netflix version
Why would you make that
The original was so great exactly so great because it focuses on the youths and you really feel the terror they must have felt
Poland, as is tradition
That seed bank in Svalbard
Mongolia
Take that Djenghiz
Get the longboats brothers
They also have a scientist looking exactly like Gordon Freeman, the apocalypse could happen there any second
Jacinda Ardern, Sanna Marin, Erna Solberg or Angela Merkel
No idea why i've only chosen women, but they all strike me as competent and compassionate leaders
Edit: i know Ardern is not european, but saw others mention outside of Europe too :)
[Sanna Marin] from Finland or [Zuzana Čaputová] from Slovakia
I like our Danish PM, but if we absolutely had to replace her, I would like to have the Finnish PM
well your president was 1 of my choices ;)
Mette Frederiksen is largely popular in Denmark
Shes doing a good job imo
> Mette Frederiksen for sure, she seems to be doing a wonderful job in Denmark as their prime minister
She is hands down one of the most authoritarian prime ministers we've had in post-war society
Sure, she's not Putin or Xi Jinping, but still, compared to what we are used to, it's not normal to have a prime minister, who doesn't take the parliament into council, or who has an unelected special advisor, who has access to political work groups, without being accountable to the electorate
If you want her, please take her
Our parliament had to vote for a law, which they were told was made on scientific background by the responsible authorities in "embedsværket". That turned out to be a complete lie
So not only did they not take parliament into council, they deliberately misinformed the parliament, which is a breech of "ministeransvarsloven".
> Dont see why special advisors (Whatever that entails) are unelected is something bad
They are unaccountable to the electorate
If they screw up, we don't have the power to remove them
That is very undemocratic
[Here's more about it, in case you are interested] This thing is completely unprecedented in modern Danish history
> your prime minister
This sounds A LOT more like an issue with the agency in question than with Mette
No, it was regarding introduction of a certain set of restrictions
The wording that the parliament was presented for insinuated the law was written on background of evaluation from the Health Authorities
It turned out that it wasn't, as it was simply just made on gut reactions, but they didn't say that, and purposely misled the parliament to get the necessary votes for the bill, as the Social Democrats do not command a majority in parliament
I'm all for transparency in government, this was a very clear breach of that
You miss the point, I don't know if it's on purpose
The government, when they wanted to do the lockdown in the spring, said their plan was informed by the relevant public agencies in charge of health, and got the other parties to support their lockdown
The thing was that it was not made on background of the recommendations of the health agencies, the government had simply lied to the rest of the parliament, when they said they had that, in order to lend credence to their policy
It's not that the government is not allowed to do purely political decisions
The problem is that they lie, to make it seem like it happens on a scientific background in order to gain the needed support in parliament
I came to appreciate how blunt and visceral Danish is when I lived abroad and spoke English as my main language for nearly four years
When your vocabulary is mostly Latin or French, the speech can't help but take on a cerebral quality that sort of gentrifies the raw and unwashed "barbaric yawps" of one's self-expression, more so when you, as a second language speaker, have learned middle class English rather than council estate English
It was such a relief coming home, and I had no idea it would be like that, having had no particular fondness for my native tongue before that experience
Lækker is also used the Dutch way in Danish
Well, the Danish use of "lækker" perfectly resembles til Dutch way to use it
We describe everything with it, just like the Dutch
It's actually quite a new thing for the Chinese to write the word 她 for *she/her* instead of 他 (*he/him*)
They started doing that in imitation of the English difference between *he* and *she* by replacing the *semantic compound* "human" with "woman" around a hundred years ago **and I hate it
** It is so much better to have the ability to remain ambiguous
I suppose our pickeld and marinated herrings are somewhat uncommon
I love the Spanish cousine, but callos was for me the only disgusting experience in Spain
A change has happened here within the last 10-20 years
Nowadays you look odd at people who eat fries without any kind of mayo
Pure mayo is unusual, but garlic mayo/aïoli, chili mayo or any kind of herby mayo is available everywhere
> Tørrfisk = Dry fish, fish hanged to dry, smells disgusting but last essentially forever
I mean, some foreigners liked that so much it became their national dish(Bacalhau in Portugal)
Cured meat is awesome
No matter if it's from fish, cows or pork
Exactly
I mean, gravlax is just sort of what salami is to pork or other kinds of cured meat
For Denmark:
- Postal service here fucking sucks
I was shocked to learn how much of Europe has stuff like Amazon Prime and one day delivery
- Things such as services, clothes and food, especially restaurants, are expensive
Yes, also relative to income
We lack a restaurant culture
Copenhagen is amazing for restaurants and street food from all corners of the world (or so I’ve had multiple even Southern Europeans tell me), yet average people go out to eat like once a month or less
Much less in the countryside
- 8 months of the year is just one big rainy blob weather-wise
Winters without proper snow are very common, which renders winter and “wow cold Scandinavia” pretty useless
- We have a tendency to “settle” socially speaking, especially after a certain age
In youth friend circles are pretty fluid but after that it’s like people retrieve into the same 2 friends
It’s not as extreme as memes make it out to be, a study actually found we are less socially isolated than Southern and Eastern Europe, but it is a tendency
And yeah we don’t small talk on the street much, and don’t use many politeness phrases (none of that last part bothers me personally though)
- School system is
alright but it’s laughably bad compared to what it could be with how much we spend on it (does not apply to Finland obviously)
I’m not personally affected by it cuz white, but racism
It’s disgustingly common for people to deny that racism even exist here (fucking lol what the actual fuck)
“Like of course we have individual racists but no systemic racism
” Fucking stop
Job applications with middle eastern names gets turned down way more often
Bouncers are extremely racist and would rather let 13 year olds in than someone middle eastern
A law was just made where police had the authority to take valuables like designer clothes from “young brown men who misbehave”, as our PM so lovingly called it
I don’t know if it’s worse or better than in any other countries, but the fact that so many people have the absolute audacity to deny that it even exists must be so discouraging for people of color
I do really love it here in general though
I had to think for a long time to come up with all of these
It always seems a bit weird to me when Scandinavians complain about the prices
Like yeah, it’s expensive here when you compare to other countries, but our salaries are also higher
A cashier at a supermarket can earn 3
500€ eg
But sure, if you just returned from Hungary where a beer is 2€ and you come home and pay 7€ for the same beer (and Denmark has cheaper alcohol than the rest of Scandinavia) it sucks
But complaining about our prices is a pretty Danish thing I guess, hence why people flock in thousands every day to go to Germany to buy candy and beer
Things that I envy Canada for:
\- Huge, diverse country
\- Mindblowing nature (Denmark is so flat)
\- Real snow
\- Legalized cannabis
(Denmark)
Darkness
Winter depressions
Alcohol overconsumption
Big usage of Anti depression medicine
Hard to make new friends if they’re not childhood friends
Law of jante
Cold winters
(Personal opinion)lack of initiation
lack of city life outside drinking culture, at least for many youths
Moderate politics if people you want more extreme politics
(Plus for many)
Lots of rain
Cold rain
Foreigners talking about only Copenhagen
Ghetto problems
Muslim problems
Gang problems
(Personal opinion) no Euro and we have to do mathematics whether we travel outside our country, same with foreigners who have euros who visit here
We have a weird form of “currency nationalism”
As y’all can see we do have negative sides and it isn’t paradise on earth
It should be noted that those numbers are for Norway
Right now in DK we have light from 7:45 ish to 16:30 ish
Which I think is totally bearable
Also being a small and somewhat homogeneous country, people tend to get narrowminded and complaining about the smallest issues
Politicians (some) will engage in minor conflicts and we are too convinced that our way of life is superior
If you order before 5 pm on weekdays, you can at times be lucky that the package will delivered next day to a 'pakkeshop'.
I think the “not allowed to stand out” thing is very exaggerated
It’s just that a lot of Scandinavia is incredibly rural and have a small-town mentality that you would find anywhere
Whereas I as a city person don’t feel it at all
It comes from a satirical text from the early 1900’s, who was parodying a small town in Denmark
In my opinion law of Jante is actually mostly a good thing
No we don’t, that’s a myth
This sounds very universal, and Denmark is not more socially conservative than more diverse less ethically homogenous countries, quite the opposite, if anything
It's pretty difficult to make a case that the first country to legalize porn and officially recognize same sex unions is above average "narrow-minded".
Yes, I personally can't see a possibility of change when the four biggest parties have more or less all bought into neoliberalism
I think overall we’re much more left leaning in Dk in relation to Germany
Although I agree with many of OPs points, the fact is that the bar is just so much higher than most countries in the world
Anyone who thinks a socialist country exists, let alone in the Western world, has not even bothered to learn the most basic definition of socialism
The idea that *any* country “have all its shit together” is just false
Do you think Danish politicians just sit around saying “well we are a perfect paradise so I can just go home now”?
I think the gentrification and housing market and a lot of what Tony says is not that bad compared to most of the world
But that says less about how awesome Denmark is and more about how awful the world is in general
Fuck PostNord
All my homies hate PostNord
>Btw thanks Denmark for ruining our postal service too
You do understand PostNord is mostly run by Swedes in the mother company PostNord AB
We definently get snow in the winter, but rarely 'real snow', as in it stays on the ground for more than a few days before turning to grey mush- big snowy landscapes
Those are mostly just childhood memories now
And yeah I get where you are coming from in regards to travel time
It takes about 4 hours driving from one end of Denmark to the other
I really only started appreciating this after I came home from backpacking in SE Asia
It also is mostly subjective
The law of jante made me somewhat self hating in the past and I also currently gets criticized for always thinking I’m not good enough and not allowed to praise myself in the head
But I’m also an example of someone who is really caught in its laws and follows it to a tii wherever I want to or not
I feel utterly bad to say I agree with u/ehnej, and that I don't need more friends than the ones from my childhood who are still my friends
I realized I may be part of the problem
Or what kind of food should be served in Kindergarten or if people are allowed to wear religious symbols
Exactly
We have gentrification, lack of funding for schools, trade unions are weakening etc
But in so much of the world these problems are ten times as bad
This does not mean we should not work on them, but in this thread I don’t think “gentrification” as a Scandinavian issue makes much sense
We’re much better when it comes to the housing market than most places
And yet people spew it like gospel
[Primarily a good thing]
It discourages hierarchy and being a smug asshole
For me, I’ve always felt it as [“don’t brag”] rather than “you should hate yourself”.
Someone else in this thread debunked it
Is that the next sunrise or the next time the sun reaches Longyearbyen
Because when I was there, I remember them telling me that it took a fair bit longer before the sun reached above the surrounding mountains
Exactly
It’s kind of like the ghetto discussions
“Ghettos” in the nordics are just not the same thing as in most other countries
I remember a TV segment where a UK policeman visited a danish ghetto and laughed because it was so different
Yeah maybe my interpretation is wrong but it’s generally the interpretation my family shows
Well, I in fact, do like socialism, but Denmark is not a socialist state by any measures
It is very common in Denmark, and completely integrated into day to day use
“Okay” and “coca cola” are the two most statistically universally known words
It's in the danish dictionary
It's completely a part of the language
"When the Norwegians ask if they can have large parts of the North Sea, say no
Me: “Well in a year or so you will be reunited with northern sleswig”
Him: “Aweso-“
Me: “Then we capitulate 6 hours into The next war”
Him: “Ohh
First Germany then America
You had a wild century
I feel like scandinavian history is often just seen as the Viking era, when a lot more had happened throughout time
I think most Danes would say Copenhagen - especially the Amager area, so I'm going to throw a curveball and say [Århus]
Copenhagen and Aarhus are obvious choices, but I'm going with the new [Køge Nord Station] It looks stunning
I would also say Aarhus, while Copenhagen is more international and much larger, Aarhus is dominated by its university which is the largest in all of Scandinavia
The constant expansion of the university (which was established in  1928) has also means that the city has seen large scale growth for a very long time, unlike copenhagen which has even seen population decline at some periods
So a lot of Aarhus is relatively newly built compared to Copenhagen which has a lot more old buildings
Agreed
Vejle's Bølgen and Fjordenhus are cool :)
In Denmark we have a number of Village with only two letter like Ho and No
There might be some town names with only two or even one letter, but I think that Lem deserves an honourable mention - other than being a short name it can also mean a certain part of the male anatomy
> "Au" (which means meadow)
TIL "Au" means different things in different parts of Germany… In North Germany it' a very small river
Dialects of Danish too:
> æ a u å æ ø i æ ø
"I am out on the island in the river"
I think French is closer to English than Dutch
There are so many words in English that come from French
Baggins is "Sækker" in danish which means "to put something in a bag"
In Danish Christopher Robin is named Jakob
I get that sometimes a name is too hard for children, so they give characters a new name, but Christopher is not an unusual name in Denmark
The HP series is filled with name translations to create the same name "clues" the English version has
Lockhart f.ex
is Glitterik Smørhår which means Glittery Butterhair - e.g "smooth as butter". Moody is called Skrækøje (Horror-eye) Dunder (old word for thunder)
Umbridge is called Madam Nikjær, which means someone who is zealous
Lupin for some reason was translated to Lupus, which didn't really change much, as both words are equally well-known by children in Denmark (meaning, basically not at all)
And then, of course, since they had to make the "I am Lord Voldemort", Tom Riddle's name is translated
His name is instead: Romeo G. Detlev Jr
(Jeg er Voldemort), which I  always found funny, seeing as he is supposed to be charming and handsome
Reading Game of Thrones, I absolutley HATE the translation of names and places
Names that have a direct meaning (like snow) is translated, so its Jon Sne
And the names of the direwolves are also translated, and not even directly, Ghost is translated to Hvide (=White)  for some reason
And the places, dont get me started on the places
Kings Landing is Kongs Havn (Kings harbour ish) and Winterfell is Vinterborg (Wintercastle) and I mean, you get where they are coming from, and maybe its just because I saw the series first
But damn I hate it
It’s the same in Danish and I’d imagine Norwegian too
Maybe Lupin was translated so not to confuse it with the flower called Lupin
(Lupinus luteus)
Though lupin in older Danish is called Ulvebønne (Wolf's bean)
Maybe, though I can't imagine that would be much of an issue with kids
I certainly didn't know it back then, and my dad taught nature science
However, Lupus could be confused with the decease, which I suspect more people know about than the Latin name of the flower
In my opinion, it feels sorta similar to what happened to a lot of cathedrals after WW2
Parts of it will remain, it's not like the fire is leveling it to the ground
The facade and large parts of it are made of stone
The rest will be rebuilt
Will it ever be the same
But we aren't losing the cathedral, only the originality of the parts destroyed
Also I think it's worth mentioning that many of the parts of the cathedral themselves aren't **that** old, as it was restored "recently" in the 19th century
I do feel that way, but it's not because it's European (I've never seen it in person), but because it's such an extremely important piece of world culture
I'd feel the same if we lost the Statue of Liberty or Angkor Wat
It feels a bit unempathic to write this, but I honestly feel sadder about this than when a celebrity I like dies
Maybe it's related to the fact that you know people come and go and usually don't last more than 100 years, while there's just some sort of expectation that old cultural heritage will be around forever
As a European I'm devasted, as a historian I'm devasted
However, Notre Dame is burning
It has burned before and once it's rebuild, which it will be, it'll likely burn at some point again
It's terrible
We're losing a part of our history and a part of French and European culture and symbolism
But it's not over and it won't be over for hundreds of years after we die
Notre Dame is not gone, nor will ever be as long as we keep it stand as a remembrance place for our culture
I feel fragile and very mortal
What we have together is so frail
The slightest tremor can destroy us
We need to unite and work together
I agree
I feel devestated that I never had a chance to see that beautiful building
Yes I'm aware, like I said, I'm a historian - it was also not the point of my post at all to debate the semantics of the different fires, nor whether or not what happened is tragic
I think I made it very clear that I believe it's very tragic
That was clearly not the point of what I wrote
In Denmark we grow up on a very rude and sarcastic sort of humor that makes the rest of the world clutch their pearls if used on no Danish citizens
Yes a bit
I am a bit more contained, as I cannot as easily discern the other person's personality from their way of speaking
At the same time I use less slang and speak a more "standard" English than I do Danish
Absolutely
Haven't really thought about it
But it's definitely an interesting question
And now I probably will think about it
I've discussed this in other threads about swearing, but I swear in english when i'm a little annoyed
I swear in Danish when i'm legitimately pissed
It's pretty similar for me: I can be articulate and elegant when communicating
But in English I become white trash
I'm not aware
Maybe outside of EU
The thing is, capitals are often quite large cities
and so there's more traffic and more idiots
Politics are also done in the capital, and so most people hate AT LEAST half the politicians
Personally i never understood the point of a capital city
I've really got very few positive things to say about Copenhagen
and if i lived there, i'd spend most of my time trying to move out
The same in Denmark with Copenhagen
As a Copenhagener, I feel a bit embarrassed
Copenhagen really does get much more attention and money than the rest of the country, and it’s a shame
I could think of hundreds of places that would need it more
Interesting
As a Copenhagener, I’m trying to understand what people don’t like about it
Probably that it's too close to Sweden
Too big
Too many people
Gets too much attention compared to other cities
People from there tend to, in my experience, act like they're better than everyone else
As a person from Jylland living in Copenhagen, the last part rings so true
I've met more Copenhageners than I care to admit who are proud of having never been to any part of Denmark outside sjælland because "there's no need to" and who really look down on the rest of the country like they are a bunch of backwards hillbillies
It’s sad that you have that experience with people acting like they’re better than others
I’m a little embarrassed by the fact that it gets so much attention and money
I feel like there’s hundreds of places that needs it way more
Regarding there being too many people, I think that can depend on where you go in the city
I avoid the centre like the plague and mostly spend my time in just my neighbourhood, which is only just being built up, so there aren't too many people out here, yet
Good headphones and a job that's also on the outskirts or not right next to Nørreport help, too
Yep, it's sad, but it's happened pretty consistently, especially when they learn I'm from Jutland
English: very much taken for granted and I’ve met extremely few people who don’t speak it
All other languages are optional
German or French conversational level is more common among older generations
In Denmark everybody speak English
We are also taught German and French (and may choose more languages) but few are fluent
My 16 year old is fluent in English
English is considered common and i have yet to see an adult, who cannot speak English, tho i have noticed a trend of older people speaking with a very British English accent, and younger people leaning more to American, wich is probably due to more exposure to American through the internet, German or French is a 50/50
Understanding english is highly exoected from most Danes, since we get english education in school
It's expected to atleast know English here, and quite a few manage passable German
So it was a chock to me; when I sent a meme to a woman I have been chatting with for at while, and she asked me to translate
I got into a bit of a heated discussion about this with my mother once
She has never lived in Denmark and knows next to nothing about daily life here
She was trying to convince me that because I speak English and had completed a Bachelor's degree, I must be in the top tier for in-demand jobs
I tried to explain to her that that was the extreme *bare minimum* for a lot of jobs, at least in the field I wanted to get into, which was why I was taking my Master's at the time
If you only had a Bachelor's, you would definitely have to make up for it with experience and being fluent in English would impress no one
She kept insisting that my English proficiency alone should basically qualify me for a managerial position and I kept trying to tell her that *everyone* speaks English, is expected to speak English, and I'm not special
It’s also a bit of a shock for foreigners moving here
A lot of them have a naive view that knowing English will make them attractive on the job market
Nope, you’re competing with Danes who are fluent in Danish *and* English
That's close to the thinking she had, that the workforce is full of monolingual Danes I could one-up
Yeah, not so much
English is absolutely taken for granted, here, at all levels
It's not just executives and managers at international firms who are expected to know English, "even" basic-level retail and "blue-collar" jobs often require people to have at least some knowledge of English
And people do
In the USA
Ha, if you speak English with that Irish accent; everyone will love you here
Family and the closest friends can help themselves to anything they want - but it is of course polite to ask first
Anyone else - no, would never happen
Norway: I have admittedly never been there, but their national day, the 17th of May
I wish we had a national day that we actually celebrated, and a cool national dress
Sweden: Sweden’s wooden houses look super cute
All of our houses are bricks
Every Swedish person I've known has always been really, really nice
Incredibly helpful, friendly, and kind
There doesn't seem to be as much posturing or as many inflated egos on the other side of the bridge
When I was in **Sweden** last time, one thing I really liked was how their cafés operated and how huge of a culture they seemed to have around just hanging out there
Also, they are more progressive than we are, which is generally positive but can be negative at times
**Norwegians** are so much it almost hurts
For me they are basically the Canada of Scandinavia
Such a nice and open people, I absolutely adore them (heck, for a while I actively sought out Norwegians guys when dating)
Also the make great TV and have a awesome youth culture
I also want to go on your version of Rus, it looks so much more fun than ours
**Germany** deserves mad respect for how the evolved as a country post-WW2
They are the prime example of owning up to your mistakes and actively trying to be better for it
Also, they are such a humble and hard-working people
I work closely with Germans and even lived there for a while and they are always a delight
Also, German has a movie industry on par with the US or UK
I'd say that at least 3 out of my top 10 best movies of all time are German
Germany, I really like your food
When we were in Czechia this summer we had a recouring problem where we only got a relatively small plate of food everytime we went out to eat
(Except for that it’s an amazing country
) Being only three guys we were often left semi-hungry
On our way back we were driving through Germany and stopped in a small town diner and ordered the best you can get, wienerschnitzel with mushroom gravy
We were sitting with a big beer and the waiter comes with three HUGE servings, probably too big, and to make up for our experience in Czechia of course we had to eat every single particle of food on our plates
We hadn’t been so full in two weeks
So they know how to feed a man, and I always have to get a schnietzel or currywurst when I’m in Germany
Wait a minute
Don't think of it as oppression
Think of it as creating a tight bond between the peoples of our nations through many years of *national cooperation***.**
I always forget about them
I like their cheap bakeries everywhere
Thanks
Love the way you guys pronounce it "Sjøpenhaavn"
We like them for the cheap soda, beer and candy you buy at the borders hops
Rasmus Paludan
We'd be better off without that cunt
Donald Trump
ban him from the entire Kingdom of Denmark, so he could never set foot in Greenland either
Likely Rasmus Paludan - let him get a taste of his own medicine
Rasmus Paludan
Or big arse racist
Well, the ban can come after he has served his second three month prison sentance
Of what I know
It’s probably peter Madsen
Although I’m sure there are worse criminals
If I could ban all pedophiles and murderers I would be happy
Or at least people that don’t regret their decisions
But since it’s only one person I guess peter Madsen, or whoever you s the worst and most despicable criminal in Denmark
For politics I don’t actually know
Probably the Leader of Nordfront in Denmark or the Leader of hizb-ut-tahrir in Denmark
I Think Kasem Said Ahmad would be a better idea
I would be fine with soros here
I'm fairly sure that he knew about us at some point, but it is of course likely that he have forgotten us
One can only hope
Of course, but I don't think he knows about them yet
There's always going to be valid arguments for other candidates, but Paludan for me is a dangerous man to have in our society
Very saying though, that I suggest a well-known Islamophobe and your reaction is to suggest the spokesperson for Islamisk trossamfund
The man has been thrown out of EL for his extremely hard opinion on women this man his more dangerous
He was also member of the delegation that travelled around the Middle East to bash on Denmark
Then he's your pick
Mine is still Paludan
Yes
There's a verified names list, and if your newborn's name isn't on there, I'd imagine it usually isn't a difficult process verifying a new one
Every year some news media will always make a short article about ridiculous new names that made it to the list that year
I recall "dreng" being one of those names a few years back
It literally means "boy", and that might not sound too uncommon for English nations, but it doesn't make sense in Danish
The whole list came about when a couple tried naming their kid "Anus" if I recall correctly
When did this list get introduced
As I recall, laws for naming your children got liberalised in the 00's. Has that been reverted
I’m disappointed that the Kobold isn’t a tiny dragon person :(
Moesgaard Museum in my home town of Aarhus is legit the best archaeological museum in the world
Outstanding exhibitions and also some pretty unique findings
In Denmark there are two that comes to my mind, The National Museum in Copenhagen or Moesgård outside of Århus
As for "traditional" museums (i.e. lots of glass cases and information panels), the National Museum is probably the best, and certainly the largest
As for "modern" museums, it's probably either Moesgaard (as has been mentioned several times by other posters) or the M/S Maritime Museum in Helsingør (which curiously hasn't been mentioned)
Both are big, new and fancy, but don't let being "new and fancy" compromise too much with being interesting and informative
Moesgaard is a fantastic museum
There are great historical museums in Copenhagen too, but the exhibitions at Moesgaard are very well designed
Overwhelming and informative at the same time
The museum just dragged me in
I've never experienced that before at a museum
Moesgaard is number one for me too, but If I should choose one in Copenhagen (where I'm from), it would be Glyptoteket because it is such a beautiful place
Moresgaard is amazing
In terms of fine art Aros is good, but Louisiana and SMK are the best IMO
In the fine art sphere, I love Hamburger Bahnhof - amazing museum
Denmark has some pretty dank local museums
We have one of the strongest local archaeological traditions in the world, and it really shows
I really believe Aarhus is punching above its weight in Museums
I dunno if you had time to visit Aros and Den Gamle By while you were here, but they are both quite world class as well, although I'm not tha tmuch into art
Its definitely the style of the exhibitions that really sell it in Moesgaard, the design is really well made
The new Freedom Museum in Copenhagen about the WW2 Occupation is also quite good, but its subject matter is a bit limited of course
Glyptoteket is an absolutely fantastic building and they have som nice pieces
As a museum, though, it's pretty boring
At least the permanent exhibition
It's just "Roman dude 1", "Roman Dude 2", "Rich Roman Dude", "Rich Egyptian" etc
I once spend an entire monday at the Teylers instead of going to uni
One of the things I enjoyed the most was figuring out how certain instruments worked
And being invited to eat strawberry cake a staff member brought to work
It came with a nice behind-the-scenes tour
I suspect it wasn't one of their busiest days ;-)
Does the Netherlands have any good museums related to the VOC / colonial history
I was there like eight years ago but only really saw the Rijksmuseum but I'm curious if there is more
This summer I went to Ribes new museum of Witches and Witchcraft - that one was dope as hell
Super modern and interactive
My parents would speak English to each other when they were trying to hide something from me and my siblings
I guess it worked out great, because both my sister and I became fluent at age 13-14
After we learned what they were talking about they switched over to German, which neither my sister nor myself understood
It was the perfect plan, untill my mom found out that my dad didn't understand a word she was saying
We're all native Danes, but have languages taught to us in school
My parents switched to English when they were arguing before I could understand it
Yes, we typically speak English
But then we went to Bali for a couple of months and we (the parents) only spoke English to other people, so the kids caught up and soon understood everything
In Denmark: Mom and dad are fluent in English and German
So in the beginning they would use both
Then we kids learned English, and they started talking in German more
Then we kids started learning in German, and now they sort of couldn't.. Well sort off
Becuse both my younger brothers are decent at German
And I. Am NOT
I got no idea what is going on
I can a few words
I could probably order a beer at a resturant
And some how with handgestures make people understand I need a toilet if I was in Germany
But that's it
So my family will now have conversations in German, and I will just be at a loose
I struggle with learning languages and generally learning due to a bad ADHD
So I am behind on stuff like that
The only reason I learned English was because we went to America for 2 years
But is weird seeing my younger brothers being smarter and better than me, in just about everything
my parents used to speak german to my
older siblings when they didn’t want me nor my sister to know what they said
When i was younger they spoke english, then i learned english, then they started speaking german but my dad is really bad at that and now i speak german too
My parents did the same thing, but when I started understanding them, they switched over to German, and that one still works if what they’re talking about is complicated enough
Never annoyed, anyone who tries speaking Danish needs all available encouragement
I'm not at all offended if people just speak English to me, though
I used to teach danish to foreigners, and it was the most common complaint that Danes "refused" to let them try speaking in danish and always just switched to English - no matter how simple the conversation (even "a coffee, please" would get rejected)
That's why I always make a point of letting people try in danish - it's a hard enough language as it is
No need to make it more difficult to learn by minimizing the platform
I do also have the privilege that years of listening to people learn danish, has made me quite good at picking up on what people want to say, rather than what they are actually saying
Hope you weren't forced to say "rødgrød med fløde" for laughs more than 5 times a day
I've recently became very aware of this as i have to homeschool my 6 year old son
It's most of the time yes 'a' sounds like that but it can also sound like a 'e' or like a very flat version of 'a' this is just something you have to remember
and then I'm just wtf is wrong with my native language it's just horrible
I always feel sorry for people trying to learn danish
Yeah, same in Copenhagen
In Denmark we call them "the English ghetto".
Near the coasts: that fresh and salty sea-smell
Copenhagen area: baked goods and sewer
Inland: fertilizer mixed with fresh air
I'm sorry, what
Scratch and *sniff*? What kind of ballsacks are you guys buying
You nailed it
Now hang on where does the sewer come in XD
Does Copenhagen really smell like sewer
I’ve lived both in and out of cph, and though I do agree that there is a certain staleness to the air in the inner city, I wouldn’t go as far as call it sewer like
Edit: BTW I 100% agree with you on everything else, the first thing I thought of was the fresh wind
I think it’s more of an “inner city”-smell tbh, and it’s not there all the time (like the fertilizer-smell inland), but when walking down the street in Copenhagen (or Aarhus/Aalborg for that matter) I find that you sometimes get that unpleasant “sewer-smell” punching its way into your nose
I’m just here to see where I can go and do urbex
That’s sad, small towns are not doing well here either
Does Sweden have a lot of abandonned building
Haven’t been there since I was a kid
That’s cool was gonna go sometime anyways
The thing is, marijuana is really harmless compared to other drugs
It's also way less addictive than smoking and drinking, so if you make sure to only do it on your days off, then it shouldn't be a problem
BUT there is serious side effects if your brain hasn't developed fully yet, like reduced inteligence, so minors should NOT smoke and/or ingest marijuana
Furthermore, it would make the drug more safe for everyone if it was legalized, so all in all, I think it should be legalized, but with an age cap at ATLEAST 21, preferably more
>3) It's less harmful than tobacco and alcohol, which are perfectly legal instead
That depends on how you define less harmful
Cannabis is more likely to permanently damage you cognitive abilities than either of those two others
It lowers people's IQs and damage their memory
I thought England, UK, Great Britain was the same thing and I thought Scotland, Ireland and Wales were places in England
Yes we are
The term is not geographical as much as historical
I completely agree
Merrild kaffe best everyday coffee in Denmark
10 times better then the fox-piss Karat kaffe
They can recycle all they want, but I still won't buy a nestle product ever
British people don't take their shoes off
Non-native speakers often have a hard time distinguishing between the vowels "ø" and "o". The result is that *rovdyr* (predator) is often mispronounced *røvdyr* (ass-animal)
It is pretty funny
I knew a exchange student who would pronounce *kælling* like *killing*. Hard to take it seriously when he tried calling you a bitch, but called you a kitten instead
That makes me think of the queens (French) husband - he was once telling the media how he went fox hunting  and caught a fox
Because ræv (fox) and røv (ass) sounds very similar he accidentally said he caught an ass
nope
never heard about 'millenials' and 'boomers' before encountering americans on the internet
There aren't even danish translations of the words for Gen X, Babyboomer, millenials etc
Nope
Most people I know, don't even know the different generations
Well
Mostly only on 2 subjects
immigration and climate change
Though to be completely honest, when you look at the demographic of how people vote during elections, it seems more like, the people living in the larger cities, want more immigration and a focus on climate change
and the people living out in the rural areas and small towns, want less immigration and don't care about the climate change
but that said, i've not really asked around
that's just the sense i get, when i hear comments from the citizens, in the news, or they talk about a poll etc
Well to be fair, while Americans might be more focused on generations, we do have one generation that comes up from time to time - that being "68'er generationen" (Generation of 68')
It is sometimes  stereotyped as being sort of an entitled generation, which participated in ungdomsoprøret (60's counterculture movement), going on to sit on the top posts in society, and then got more conservative and greedy as the years passed on
Never heard of that
My hometown has a house with a [window] that musn't be closed or the ghost inside with burn down the city
The tale goes as follows: in the 1330s to 1350s or so Denmark had been invaded by the Germans (btw, recommend everybody interested in history to read the history surrounding this, its some GoT shit - literally a battle of kings)
In my hometown (Randers) the German had situated their foothold with around 4000 of their total 11000 men, all led by a German count called Gert
Count Gert faced a rebellion from local former knights and squires, one of them a squire called [Niels Ebbesen] One night Ebbesen's men (47 in total) burned some barns around the city, drawing the counts men out the city gates to check the situation
While the men were out, Ebbesens himself dressed as a farmer and snuck into the city and into the home of the count
Here he beheaded the count in his bed, who now haunts the building (there are some factual difficulties here, as the building with the window was built around 300 years later and the old building burned down, but still)
Apparently the window has been closed three times in total since the building was made, and every time the building has caught on fire and caused a lot of damage in the area by the fire spreading
There's also an additional legend that says that the German men who followed Ebbesen and his men as they fled the city, haunt a local bridge
The Danish knights had loosened the bridge and as the Germans rode over it, they pulled the bridge so the German men fell into the river Gudenåen, and drowned
They now haunt this bridge and will pull people into it to get revenge on Danes
Of course, much like with the building, [the original bridge] doesn't exist anymore, though it has been replaced with a [blue metal one] instead
Plus there's really no evidence that the German men actually died on the bridge at all
There is this statue in Helsingør. It’s a statue of Holger Danske
It’s a “haunted” statue which according to the legend, comes to life if Denmark is in war
The ‘Stuff You Missed In History Class’ podcast have made an episode about this called “The Allegedly Haunted Island  of Poveglia”. It’s a good listen
Firstly, the statue is not in Copenhagen but in Castle Kronborg which is in Elsinore (Helsingør)
Secondly, if the myth is true then we now know that it will take more than 6 hours to wake him up, considering that that was the approximate amount of time it took the germans to subjugate us on the 9th of april 1940
Yea, I did no research, thanks for correcting me
You’re welcome
Ingen årsag makker
> Does Danish not have any words that would be offensive in some situations
"Sweden" is considered a very uncultured and vulgar word
We use fuck *very* liberally
As a general population, not really, people doesn’t really find certain words offensive
None of that "before 9 pm" business here
I've heard several "fuck"s and its variants at all times on publicly broadcast radio and tv, even during programmes aimed at kids/teenagers
Can confirm
Wouldn't even use that word about my worst enemy
I think that's because it doesn't mean as much as it's a foreign word and therefore not as 'potent' - it's been very well adapted and adopted, but it's still not as ingrained, so, therefore, doesn't carry the same weight
And in a lot of cases, if you do find them offensive, you'll be told you can't take a joke, or that it wasn't that serious/they didn't mean it that way and why are you spoiling all the 'fun'?
Ø (island), å (a small-ass river), i (in) and I (plural you)
I (2nd person plural)
I (in)
Ø (island)
Å (stream, small lake)
Ø, which is an ø
Å = stream/flood
Ø = Island
Ø - Island
Å - A smaller river
We don't have any big enough to qualify for an actual river
Those are called "floder" in Danish
I - You(plural)
i - In/inside
I may have missed some
We have "ø" which is the danish word for island
"I" is "you" in pluralis (must be a capital i)
"I" and "i" is "in"
"Å" is "stream" as in a creek
"Ø" is "island"
Move to southern Jutland and every single word is just single vowels
Ø meaning island
Ø = Island
Å = Creek
Quite a few more if you find the right vestjyde or sønderjyde as well
"A æ u å æ ø i æ å" = I'm on an island in a creek
My godparents speak like that and it's great
Greenlandic: hold my igloo
Danish is one of the languages with the highest amount of vowels (and sounds in general, but especially vowels) in the world
I find consonants much harder to learn to pronounce in other languages and harsher on my throat
If you're actually curious, I can find a video real quick :)
Edit:  she says it around 3 seconds
is roughly correct timestamp she also says the sentence in rigsdansk afterwards
And it's just a feature of the language
IIRC we have the most vowel sounds of any language in the world, though not the highest amount of sounds
It is harder but no not that much harder
We’re by far the ones that gets the most language hate among Nordics
Yes, I don't understand 90% of what my swedish friend says in swedish, but on text it's pretty similar tbh
It's edited into my previous comment now
Not rude, but many people won't tell you if they ask
Personally I don't care
My salary is public information anyways since I am employed as a researcher at a University
What's Belarus like
I hear some frightening stories from there
And there are also those who just walk on their own, in Copenhagen
Absolutly not Denmark
We drink like holes in the ground
It's weird and convoluted, the grammar and spelling is completely different but if you read it aloud you can understand pretty ok
“Can I borrow the toilet
Also, eventuelt means alternatively, but is sometimes spoken as eventually
Privatøkonomi, personal finance, becomes private economy
“Let’s get concrete”, and “Concretely I mean
” because konkret means specific
Danes tend to overuse "that" in sentences
Often instead of "which" or at other times as a completely redundant word
Actual does mean current tho
I once knew a guy almost always insisted on pronouncing the silent letters in English
Couldn't convince him that knight wasn't pronounced knait (now I wonder why he didn't also claim it'd be knai**g**t), that knee wasn't pronounced knii or that sword wasn't svord (like with a v not as with a w)
Interesting if you search 'actual definition' on google, one of the definitions is that actual can mean current, with a source of the oxford dictionary, but the oxford dictionary explicitly says that this is not correct
He says kaniggit though
I was flying home from Hanoi, and because of a sudden change in tickets, I was now going over Moscow
As I then found out, the woman in the next seat was not only also Danish, but her grandfather had been my English teacher in school
No unfortunately not
If you've got no passport or driver's license you can apply to get something that's halfway it
In Denmark, either your drivers license or your healthcare(?) card is mainly considered your ID
We don’t. We have a health insurance card which is sometimes acceptable, but it has no photo
This contains your sUpEr SeCrEt personal number
But if you know the persons gender and birthday there are only 500 combinations
The famous musician Kim Larsen named an album his personal number as a joke
Other than driver's license or passport, the closest in Denmark would be the  ["sundhedskort"] (health card) (formerly "sygesikringskort" (health insurance card)) which states the person's full name, address, CPR number (literally Central Person Register), the person's doctor's name and address as well as municipality and region of residence
In denmark we use this Things called NemID
It’s just  [some paper thing] you get
It’s a kind of ID “code” you get
To identify yourself in public, we have our [drivers license] and [health insurance]
We have a "Health card" with name, address, cpr-number (central person registration-number
Everybody has a unique number from birth) and name of doctor
It does not have a picture on it
We use it when going to the doctor's or hospital or other health-related places
It can also be used as ID for example if you are picking up a package from the postoffice
Denmark doesn’t issue an official ID card that you can use internationally, however the counties/communes issue an ID card that can be used for purchase of alcohol or other stuff
Which you can get at the age of 15, as you can be hold criminally accountable (at adult levels) at the age of 15
Another thing you can use it for, previously stated, purchase of alcohol, which you can do at age 16
This is only usable in Denmark, as far as my knowledge go
You could argue that our social security cards count as IDs, as they contain our social security number
You can't use them as ID anywhere and they don't fit the EU/eea standards for id cards
You can use them in conjunction with a student card
Some places
But it's not a valid national ID, e.g. It can't be used as id for travel in the Shengen area
A true national ID can be used to board planes and other places instead of a passport in Shengen
Without research I think I can comfortably say Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Copenhagen
Interestingly, the second largest for much of the 1800s was Charlotte Amalie - on St
Thomas in the Caribbean
Actually I think, Malmø might've been more populated than Copenhagen at some point during the 16th century
English is so prevalent in society that you can't help being a little familiar with English before actual English classes
My generation was almost exclusively taught British English in school yet when we speak it's evident we got our spoken English from movies, cartoons, music, games, not from our teachers
I started learning English in the 3rd grade
(I think that would be 10 or 11 years old)
About a year and a half later I felt confident enough in my English skills to watch youtube videos in English
Things really picked up from there
A couple months later, I was speaking English so much that my friends made a rule saying I wasn't allowed to other than during English class
Started as a 9 y/o in school
I was slightly under average
At 14-15 y/o I started playing with and talking to people from other countries (namely The UK, The Netherlands & Norway)
That is when my English improved significantly
I also really began watching YouTube videos and streaming movies in English
What worked for me was not the many schemes of bending words in school
Actively using the language made me want to not make too obvious grammatical mistakes
Hearing people talk/reading what people write was also a great way to learn the language’s construction better
When I was 7 or 8 I started learning it in school, I believe you start learning it at 5 years old now though
I improved by playing video games, such as CSGO and Fifa
It's uncommon not to speak English in Denmark too, since we learn from such an early age
I learned in already 5th grade already
children in Denmark learn English from first grade now
Danish is such an uncommon language that foreign languages are taught from a very early age
Besides, unlike some of the big European countries,movies and books aren’t all translated to our native language, so we learn it through different media
I started learning english by watching videos
I used to watch english youtubers and watch the video with subtitles then when it's done I watched it again without subtitles and tried remembering the words
But my grammar is not as good as my english
I haven't actually heard of anyone doing it, but on my schools FAQ about exchange programs, there is a section about doing exchanges to other Danish universities
Even another university in the same city
I have stereotypes of how they all look in my head, and it’s pretty distinct (I.e more olive skin, green eyes and curls for South, that dark almost black hair colour and brown eyes for East) but in reality I probably wouldn’t.
I'd say through a combination of clothes, hair and some facial features, I can often make an educated guess
I grew up in a very international enviroment, and a common phrase we've heard growing up is people going "oh yeah I see that" when someone mentions which country they are from
I've certainly more than once recognised Brits, Germans and Scandinavians when travelling
Dutch, Russian and Polish I can usually also catch
Its usually things like a slight difference in underlying skin tones, eyes or height, combined with fashion/style
Brits, for example, have this haircut that I immediately associate with only them
They also tend to have thinner/smaller mouths and a faceshape that I generally don't see outside the UK
Germans seem to have a very particular fashion sense (not judging whether its good or not, but it certainly isn't like what we wear in Denmark, but I'm sure it's fashionable in Germany, as I see their celebs wearing it as well)
As well as their eye shape and placement sometimes being a little different than the rest of Europe
With the other nationalities I could also say small things like that, which would make me assume they were from those countries
That being said, all of these are stereotypes and loads of people from these countries don't look like that
Nationalities don't really equal ethnicities, and as other have mentioned, we've been banging across country borders for ages in Europe
Now that you mention it, they do really love digging holes on the beach
Whats up with that
I haven't been able to find a proper picture of it, since most of the ones I have is of my old British classmates and I don't feel comfortable sharing those, but it's sort of like [this] but less styled and professional looking
Also what I like to call the "ceasar hair" also seems more common in the UK than I've seen anywhere else
Mind you, I'm a danish women living in Denmark atm, and don't really follow UK mens hair fashion, so it mostly based on the hair I see on tourists or my UK friends when I lived there
I mean it seems quite practical to me, so it makes sense that it's popular is you can't bothered to do too much grooming
Buy secondhand whenever possible and buy quality instead of cheap, easy breakable things
In Denmark we have "there is no cow on the ice" (der er ingen ko på isen) which roughly means "there is no problem".
"Theres no cow on the ice" translates to "there's no problems" in Denmark
I don't know if they are unique to my country alone, as us Scandinavian languages are quite similar in some ways, but here are some
* "Det sætter mit pis i kog" ( It boils my piss) - something that just pisses you straight off, but just mentioned it
* "Gå agurk" ( Go cucumber) - Go amok
* "Der er ugler i mosen" ( there is owls in the bog) - means when something is suspicious or suspicious things are happening
* " Fra børn og fulde folk skal man høre sandheden" (from kids and drunk folks, will always tell you the truth) - It means adults never tell you the whole truth
* "At kaste perler for svin" ( To throw pearls at swine) - Means when your or others, smart/good advice(s) aren't appreciated
* " Ingen ko på isen" (no cow on the ice) - no danger
Now to my favourites
* "Pis mig i øret" (piss me in my ear) - either used when something is annoyed or a "polite" way to tell someone to fuck right off
* "Så er den ged barberet" ( now that goat is shaved) - Means that you finished/complete a task
* " Hvad du ikke ved af, har du ikke ondt af " (what you don't know you can't feel bad about) - "Just read the translation"
* " Saml appetit ude, spis hjemme" (look at others, but eat your wife/husband) - you are welcome to be horny for others, but only fuck your wife/husband
* " At falde er ingen skam, men at blive liggende er" (to fall is no shame, but stay laying is) - No shame is failures, but not trying/giving up, is great shame
* " Hellere styr på lortet end lort på styret" (rather have control on your/the shit, then shit on the controlled) - It means that you should rather know your/the shitshow, then let the shitshow get out of control
I have a lot more if people wants
"få røven på komedie" "get your ass on comedy" it means your in trouble
Dumb women in my country is called a broom
I also have another
Klap lige Hesten (pet the horse) which means come on
In Denmark its “Lad være med at gøre en myg til en elefant”.
We use mosquito to elephant as well
Im fairly certain that moss/mosse (norwegian/danish) translates to 'bog'
I'm pretty sure "grytor" is supposed to be translated to "pots" not "stews" - because pots have handles ("ears"), while stews only have ears if you add ears to your stew
Exactly the same in Denmark
We do
That's the role of Dansk Sprognævn
They constantly update and add words to an official dictionary which is required by law to be followed by schools and government institutions
They don't really ensure stability or really decide much of anything though
They just look at how the language is being used and alter the definitions and spellings to reflect that
They're descriptivist not prescriptivist mostly
I realise most people don't care or know anything about Africa, but it's still beyond me, how people don't acknowledge the fact that the African continent has the most French-speakers in the world
That's true, but it serves as an important lingua franca between the ethnic groups nonetheless, and the number of speakers is only prospected to increase over the years
My comment was mostly to the original question, that people think French was only spoken in France
Idk if Denmark is known for it’s beaches or not, but if you ever visit
Then make sure to visit Skagen in Denmark
Or the entire west coast of Denmark (Don’t let them fool you tho
They can kill)
Very beautiful beaches
Not sure if this is well-known but Copenhagen is recognized as the best city in the world for swimming
I'm probably dating myself here, but bands like [Kashmir] [Dizzy Mizz Lizz] and [Nephew] are the ones I like the best when it comes to Danish music
[Ukendt Kunstner] does a very good job at combining rap and beautiful instrumentals
I also like the singer’s newer, more chill and slow stuff as [Hans Philip]
D-A-D were great
And Carpark North are also great
From Finland I would recommend Korpiklaani, a Finish folk-metal band
I don't think there are two clear ones
I think some cities have rivalries with other nearby cities (like my hometown is the closes big city to Aarhus and we have a rivalry), but I don't think its as serious and Manchester/Liverpool, nor do I think people outside the area are much aware of it
And in my expirence it's like that with all the town rivalries
For Denmark, definetly Copenhagen and Brøndby (The latter being a suburb of the former) and mostly because of football
When they play against each other, you know there will be riots in the streets
Copenhagen vs Aarhus or more accurately, the island of Sjælland (Zealand) vs the peninsula of Jylland (Jutland)
Both regions have equal population sizes, and have historically always been rivals
Denmark vs copenhagen
Snobbish cunts haha (am joking)
As a Jyde who lived in Copenhagen and the surrounding area for about 8 years, I don't disagree  with love of course, but damn I've met some snobbish cunts
Not even a week ago a Copenhagener on reddit insulted me for not thinking Copenhagen is the best place to go out in Denmark
Im from north jutland and some 10 years ago i spent a few years in cph (søborg) - fuck that, people were all “ah, så du er en bonderøv”. Dude, i would rather go out in aalborg than get paid to go out in cph
Just sayin’
Yup
I'm from Randers, so you can imagine the 'jokes' (see: genuine prejudices that people disguised as jokes)
The amount of times I've had both friends and strangers tell me they were surprised I wasn't violent, aggressive, a slut, poor, unintelligent, uncultured
It's verges on at least once a week for all 8 years, if corona hadn't ruined the average
And it certainly wasn't helped by the fact that I never seemed to ever get rid of my accent (thankfully, tbh)
I got so much shit for being from Jylland while living there, it's honestly what drove me to move away from Cph again
It's working
I don't think that's a thing in Danish
Only thing I recall is when a character has an odd accent compared to the rest of the characters
In Danish they would pick the dialect Sønderjysk or Bornholmsk and sometimes Vendelbomål
So many people don't understand the difference between dialects and accents
It's not a dialect because you pronounce something different
Almost Every Region/Island has it's own Dialect
In a country as small as Denmark, we have somewhat distinctive dialects from each part of the country, though definitely not from village to village as you describe it
Basically, Jutland is divided into 3 different dialects - west, north/east and then south
West, south and central Zealand has its own distinctive dialect as well (in the northeastern part, its really just standard danish)
Funen has its own distinctive dialect as well
Lolland and Falster has the same dialect
Bornholm has a very distinctive dialect as well, which sounds almost swedish in their pronounciations
Finally, Copenhagen has its own dialect too
However, most are dying out, as most people by now are just talking slight variations of standard danish
Just wait until you hear about Denmark, we have dialects that some of us can't even understand
We are about the size of the Netherlands, but have a population less than Saint-Petersburg
Had
They are all pretty much dead now and the variation consist of regional pronunciations of Rigsdansk (Standard Danish)
This variation is NOT the same as dialect (which includes regional grammar and vocabulary)
In my experience only old people in the countryside speak actual dialect
Maybe to a certain degree Sønderjylland (South Jutland) is an exception to this
I guess you have never heard of Thyborøn?
I agree that the dialects are dying, but not quite dead yet
I guess you're right on this
though bornholm also has a dialect that is slowly dying
They are actually closer to Old Danish than our current modern variant, so if anything, they would be able to claim to be Danish
Doesn't mean we don't make fun of it
No I am referring to the deep south of Jutland and some parts of northern Jutland too
They speak something that is not easily understandable by people speaking modern, common Danish
I have and you might be right
Not much of a survival rate :P,  but the westcoast fishertowns might be places were dialects a somewhat alive
There's a clear definition of what's a dialect
It gets a bit more fuzzy when it comes to languages, though
I've heard someone simplifying it more or less like this: A dialect with a region and an army is a language
Using written language as a determining factor for whether or not something is a dialect is bad linguistics, if anything, that might be the least important aspect
What makes something a different dialect would have more to do with the vocabulary, grammar, and accent (although yes, a different accent is not enough to make it a dialect from my understanding of it, either, maybe unless it's so different it starts making it hard to understand for others
Being strict with alcohol like the rest of the Nordics
We’re
*certainly* not
people constantly talk about sweden as this socialist haven
but sitting here in Denmark, sweden is terrible in almost every aspect
they also earn less money than us, on avg
Well, it was first defined by Aksel Sandemose, a Danish writer, but he didn't come up with it, he described an existing small-town mentality
I mean the state owned liquor stores, drinking ages being 20 etc
Also they have age limits for when you can drink, laws about public intoxication and laws about public drinking
There exist no drinking age in neither Denmark or Norway .
This is what op referred to
No, the exact opposite
You guys are 18 for light stuff like beer and 20 for hard liquor (buying), we’re 16 for light stuff and 18 for hard liquor
And making people show ID is not taken seriously at all, saying this as a supermarket cashier
Well yeah, I know
Still crazy to me as here it’s sixteen (to buy)
No, normal supermarkets will sell the cheapest beers at around 3 kr
, which is 0
40 €. It's a bit cheaper than a bottle of water
Compare to Norway where they are more like 2 €. You can get a cheap bottle of booze for around 8 €. Relative to the normal cost of goods, alcohol is really cheap in Denmark
Slight correction: that's the ages at which you can legally *buy* alcohol
There's no legal age for consuming
I love the fact that “alcohol dealers” exist
I remember they used one in Skam
And if you’re 14 and therefore can’t, stores don’t really care anyway
Especially not small kiosks
I’m 16 and get asked for my ID maybe one out of 10 times I buy something
That it be it stuff for 16 year olds or 18 year olds
There are a few, mainly people at harbours selling cheap beer from Germany
But it's basically not a thing
I'm not at all sure if you have it in other countries, but "hjemkunstskab" or cooking in English
There's not really an English name for it, but if you were to put that into translate it would probably come out something like "home arts". But it's basically where you learn how to cook, clean, and take care of a kitchen
We had it through 4-6th grade I think
Not sure

Denmark has it as well
We have the mandatory cooking classes too, also in grade 7
The pic you sent looks exactly like the setup when I had it

We have it in DK as well
Also, Christianity was a subject
Again, don't know if other countries have that as well
Also, Christianity was a subject
Religion would probably have been a better name, as we didn't just learn about Christianity but also other religions
Again, don't know if other countries have that as well

Latin is mandatory for standard Gymnasiums here and you can choose Greek
Did you go to a public school
I dont remember any of these
We have hjemkundsskab too
I always thought it was about just cooking, but in hindsight I remember there being washing machines too

Must be an autonomy thing as i finished school around 14 years ago and honestly dont remember any of these
As well as Helsingør-Helsingborg I guess
Especially if the bridge will be built
Helsingør & Helsingborg really do feel like one city to me
Taking the ferry across honestly doesn't feel much different than taking a bus from one end to the other of a city
A really expensive bus
Surprisingly cheap actually
Always thought it was expensive cause I'd only ever crossed with a car
But last summer I took it on foot on the way back, and it was only something like 35 kroner
So honestly not much different from a bus
Well the war following the Stockholm bloodbath is in Sweden called something like "The Swedish Indepence War" or "The Swedish Freedom War", while in Denmark it is just called "The Danish-Swedish War" or something similar
Feel free to correct me if I am wrong
When i visited Vietnam, they obviously had a completely different view towards Americans & The Vietnam War than what I’ve gotten from western media
Denmark kind of kept Norway as a fiefdom for 600 years or so, and we had the poor taste of calling it a "Union", which it wasn't exactly
I guess the Irish will know what I am talking about
>the Stockholm bloodbath
Also they seem to think of it as a very bad thing and even go so far as to call Christian II for "Kristian Tyrann", when in fact it was the church that ordered the execution of the heretics
Gustav Vasa cleverly used this in a propaganda effort against Denmark to rally support for his cause and to this day they still believe it in Sweden, which is somewhat annoying
That was maybe the least deserved WC win of all time
Not really
Other than the Stockholm bloodbath, I have no idea what other stuff he has done and I probably know more history than the average Dane
Maybe some historians have an opinion about him, but most Danes would not
> Also we still call the king Kristian Tyrann, while I believe you consider him to be a good king
Most consider him to be a disaster of a King
In fact he was so bad, that he was deposed and kept in prison for the rest of his life
Yeah, its believed the propaganda is one of the reasons why many Swedes now thing we call him "Christian den gode" (the Good)
We don't nor have we ever, but it's apparantly a thing they are even now taught in school in Sweden
When taking my masters in Skandinavistik, I had a Swedish professor who off-hand mentioned how we call him Christian den Gode
And he honestly believed it until we (most of us in the room had also studied History at uni, thankfully) were able to tell him its pure propaganda
That's my point
It was the church in form of the Archbishop that orchestrated the thing
Although Christian II had pardoned the nobles and left them unharmed when he captured Stockholm months earlier, he had no choice but to follow the orders of the church in dealing with heretics
Of course, Christian II didn't mind having an excuse to take revenge on the rebellious nobles in Stockholm, and he went about it very "enthusiastic" so to speak
Yes, even though everybody will say it's just a meme, it really feels like Swedes take the old propaganda literally and continues to hold it against us to this day
That is exactly what I mean
You left out this part:
>All these people had previously been marked down on Archbishop Trolle's proscription list
The following day, 9 November, a council, headed by Archbishop Trolle, sentenced the proscribed to death for being [heretics]
Of course, Christian II most likely didn't mind having an excuse to take revenge on the rebellious nobles in Stockholm, even after they anointed him king, but it is after all the church you should blame
Really
Never heard of it as a meme - only ever ran into it, due to first reading about it in a museum in Stockholm, and then later when I was taking my masters in History we were taught about how they are told this in Sweden (and then of course the before mentioned incident)
It's certainly enough of a thing, even if it as a meme, that [Danmarkshistorien
dk] covers [it
] No matter what, it's ridiculous propaganda to even try and spread
Why would we call him the good
He was removed as king in 1523, shortly after the bloodbath
If he was disliked enough to be removed as king, then why call him the good
Makes no sense
Sure, like anyone with power in the church did at that time
We sincerely apologise on his behalf, so now you can return Scania, Halland and Blekinge to us, which are currently in Sweden
They have been punished enough already, wouldn't you say
As a Dane, I don't have any problem with the Swedish or Norwegian
The German and Dutch is pretty difficult
I can understand a little bit but not much
English isn't difficult at all because I speak English
If I didn't speak English I could probably understand some of it, but I think it would be like German or Dutch to me
Written Danish and Norwegian (Bokmål) are so identical you won’t always notice that it’s not, in my case, Danish
Swedish is quite understandable but u gotta give it a thought sometimes
German doesn’t have nearly the same amount of words in common
But since I had German in school a few years, I do understand the basics
Dutch
myeh
I can kinda tell what some words mean and guess my way through some sentences
But no
This is where I cannot keep up
English
No way man
Never got that language pinned down
Swedish: most of it
Norwegian: most of it
Danish: All of it
German: A little, can figure out some words that look similar to words from languages I know
Dutch: Very little only a few recognizable words
English: All of it
Low German: Nothing
Bavarian: Nothing
Luxembourgish: Very little, can guess the sentences from some keywords in the sentences
Afrikaans: Very little, same as Luxembourgish
Icelandic: Very very little
Swedish: Just enough to understand the point
Norwegian: 100%, no problem at all
Just like reading Danish
German: Understand every other sentence or so, not as easy as Swedish though
Flemish: Surprisingly enough to understand a little bit, AFAIK first time I'm reading it, but not impossible
I'm parctially fluent in English, and im natively Danish
So all of that, and the nordic languages are all very close
And the other are kinda far away
For me it is only Danish and English, with a little bit of the Norwegian one
Since I am only half danish, and have not been exposed to Scandinavian languages as much as most, I have trouble with understanding Norwegian and Swedish, so that is probably why
&#x200B;
What more confuses me is why are the different languages different articles
The Scandinavian are super short (Danish is the shortest) while ones like German and English are really long articles
Why is it not just a direct translation
Dane here:
Swedish - 100%
Norwegian - 100%
Danish - 100%
[G] - 100 % (But I am almost fluent in German)
[F] - Maybe 80% with a bit of guessing
The text makes sense
English - 100%
Low German - Less than Flemish, maybe 70 %. I can still get the overall meaning of the text
Bavarian - A bit better than Low German (all these ski trips to Austria haven't been without benefit)
Trying to pronounce the text makes it somehow understandable
But reading is takes time
75%
Luxembourgish - The most difficult one so far
50%
Afrikaans - Surprisingly easy, maybe even easier than [F] 85 %
Icelandic - I am embarrassed to say this is hard
40%
all for all of the top, except the Dutch
With the Dutch I understand maybe 85%, though it's slow reading
I understand less Low German and Bavarian than Dutch
Luxembourgish is also a slow read, but I understand most
Afrikaans is less than Luxembourgish, and Icelandic is maybe the same level as Luxembourgish
&#x200B;
I'm Danish though, and work with languages as my job while I study Scandinavistics at university, plus I had 8 years of German in School
So most I know through studying the languages
* Danish: 100 %
* Norwegian: 99 % (written Norwegian is essentially just Danish where the words are spelled closer to their pronunciation, though there may be a word here and there that differs from Danish)
* English: 98 % (there might be a few technical terms where I know the Danish word but not the English one)
* Swedish: 85 % (still very similar to Danish, but not nearly as similar as Norwegian - there were several words I had to decipher from context or plain didn't know)
* German: 40 % (I understand the gist of it, but not much more than that - I took German classes in primary school, but admittedly I forgot most of it, so almost all of my German skills derive from vacations in Germany where I've read restaurant menus, museum signage etc
* Dutch: 10 % (I can recognize several words that are similar to other Germanic languages, but I don't really get any meaning out of reading the article)
I feel like Faroese/Icelandic-speakers get the best deal in terms of Germanic-language comprehension
- Learn Danish/another Scandinavian in school
- Learn English because everybody does
- Faroese/Icelandic are similar, so have a head-start there
- Have a head-start on German grammar what with their own grammatical complexity, while indirectly absorbing much of the vocabulary through English and the Scandinavian languages
I wear "Home clothes" every day
I go outside and wear "outside clothes" but when I am arriving home I change
I shower in the evening so the routine is "come home - no need to go somewhere - shower - home clothes - pyjamas". I also have specific clothes I wear for DIY projects or garden and I always take my shoes off in the hallway near the front door
Needless to say I also have "go outside to the trashcan" or "work in the garden" or "walk around in my house" shoes and that i have a lot of floor mats
Guess i am a bit weird
Still need a denmark tag
I remember I had some old outdoor shoes at my parents house
It was litteraly just my shoes from confirmation that later after years tear became some outdoor working shoes
Sounds like everyone does it here
I do not buy clothes specifically for indoor use
Mange hilsener
Women's trousers (regular ones, not even sweatpants) are notorious for shitty pockets
A popular conspiracy theory as to why, is so that more women buy expensive handbags
I buy men's pyjama bottoms from H&M since they have even shitty pockets
Women's PJ bottoms don't have them at all, and they're basically the same garment
My phone doesn't have a case on it, since I can barely squeeze it into my pocket without one
So there's a bigger chance that it could get smashed
At this point, I'd almost give up my right to vote if only I could get decent pockets
(Not really, braver women and men than me died for that, that would be rude and disrespectful
“Jeg har set en rigtig negermand” literally means “I have seen a real negroman” but it’s an old meme here (Denmark)
In The Netherlands, there is this city called Sevenum
It’s a city with my favorite theme park, toverland
It’s beautiful in there
And I camped at “de schatberg”. It’s such a good place with a lot of nice Dutch people ready to speak English just for you
Budapest
Supposed to go there in Easter but had to postpone it to October
Madrid
Family in law lives there and we haven't seen them since Christmas
And poffertjes
Haha, I love how not even the rich can escape [the curse of ugly Belgian houses
What is it with Belgium and their sense, or lack of sense, of architecture
As others have pointed out we don’t flaunt our wealth the same way in Scandinavia, but parts of Stockholm and Copenhagen is very expensive
“Hambros Allé” is probably the most expensive street (in the Hellerup departement)
The cheapest houses goes for around 3
5mill€ and past the 10mill€ mark
Saw a random Mercedes with Saudi plates in Berlin
Apart from that it’s probably some US plate
I once saw a Russian car, but I've never seen anything from outside of Europe
Only if they are working for the North Korean state of course (looking at you Poland)
It should be spelled "ad" and not "at", since it is a fast way of writing the latin word "ad" (via) just like & is a fast way of writing the latin word "et" (and)
Snabel A, which means trunky A - like the trunk of an elephant
kanelbulle
I like this lol
In danish its also snabel-a
It is here in Denmark, I wouldn’t know what else to call it personally
But in English you just call it “at”, right
We generally suck in winter sports, as winters are usually wet, windy and miserable here
So we usually cheer for Swedes and Norwegians whenever we don't participate or qualify in snow sports
Yes:
Norway in handball
Netherlands second and Sweden third
Netherlands for football, and Sweden second
Important note: I live in NL and have a Dutch family
I would not tell my wife that I secretly cheer for Norway over Netherlands in handball
I just love those damn Norwegians so much
I generally cheer for the smaller nations, and if one of them happens to be one of our brothers Norway, Finland or Iceland that's just even better
But never Sweden
Sweden deserve only the loudest of booing
Yea usually cheer for Iceland, Norway and Finland
After that I cheer for the underdog
Never Sweden tho
Our nations are mortal enemies
List goes Norway-Iceland-Sweden-Germany
Yes, mainly Germany since my family is from Southern Jutland
We cheer when Sweden gets kicked out
Absolutely
If Denmark is out, I cheer for Sweden, Norway and Iceland
Pretty much all of the Nordics
Especially Sweden
If all of the Nordics gets thrown out it’s most likely Germany
Who were you rooting for during the World Cup QF, DEN-CRO
I am painfully aware of that, when I am routinely overtaken by 7-year old girls in pink snowsuits on the Norwegian and Swedish slopes
And what is the deal with [snowmobiles] We don't get that down here, are you all stark raving mad or what
Living in Spain I discovered that domestic violence is far more normal than in my own country, Denmark
And many people consider spanking and even a slap a natural part of a child's upbringing
>How amazingly rowdy the London nightlife is
Even in posh little Bath - passed three different brawls walking home from a shift once and was just
wtf
Another time two menacing dudes came into our restaurant just as we closed and started talking shit about everyone trying to start something
England is at once the most polite and the most aggressive country I've been in
That's super late, here we eat dinner around 6pm
Try having dinner at 5-6pm then
Side note: whenever I’ve travelled to Southern Europe I’ve always found it so irritating that I had to wait till 8-9pm to get some dinner
Here, I doubt more than 1/10 would know a decagram is
What about people who go to work early
I work as a truck driver and get up at 4
30 so for me eating at 21 is way to late
That's when I go to bed
I get up at 6, take a shower, and then have breakfast around 6:15ish
I'm flippin' *hungry* when 12:00 rolls around
It's the last "meal"but it's not uncommon to grab a snack later on, but usually not a full meal
It's the last "meal"but it's not uncommon to grab a snack later on, but usually not a full meal
Not really
We're taught the most commonly used ones and I think I've used deca like twice throughout my life
It's not very many units where it makes sense to use deca and even when it makes sense (with grams) we use single grams
No one really uses megametres, even though it technically makes sense, either
An hour to get ready, 45 minutes transport, and I like to be there 10-15 minutes early and shoot the shit with my coworkers before the actual work starts rolling in (and to avoid being late because traffic was a bitch)
> but how often do you discuss distances in thousands of kilometers so megameters will have some logical sense in such a case
Rarely, though my point was that it was a valid as everything else
I could say that the distance between copenhagen and paris is 1Mm
> For earth it is way too big scale
It would also make sense in long distance air travel
You wouldn't say you traveled 5560km london to new york here you might say you traveled 5,5Mm
> On the other side shopping is something people do daily and do you really ask your butcher for 783 grams of meat
Putting aside how extremely rarely people actually go to butchers here, no
We would ask for 250g, 500g, 750g or 1kg
It isn't about what's precise it's about what's usual
I bet you wouldn't order meat by the hectogram either
But you're welcome to come up here and convince the country that people might save a syllable or character by not using "single" grams, I frankly don't give a care
> wait what
where do you get your meat from
OK never mind, imagine buying salami or cheese, you do this thing up there
Same thing, often you can't cut slice up to gram
You buy all of those thing at the supermarket
You don't buy salami or cheese by the the gram either
You buy a piece or a whole of either (or a bag if it's grated cheese)
I bought a 200 gram piece of parmesan the other day
If I needed more than that I would've bought more pieces
So it's not sliced for me specifically
It's rare to go to a butcher here because why would you want to pay some 20% more for the same product you can get at the supermarket
People only really go to butchers if they're rich, old or if they need something special you can't get elsewhere
I mean it is, but in [packets] Do you guys have a dude the supermarket to cut cheese and salami for you
We do in some of the larger and more expensive ones
I'm not entirely sure how it works though and I'm not sure if they have cheese
Until you called it a deli counter I had kind of forgotten they existed as the shops I usually frequent don't have them
I know very little about any of them, but I get the impression that most of them work as tax havens for the 1% of Europe
If that is correct, I don't like them
Otherwise, I mostly find it amazing that they managed to navigate the mess that was europe up untill 1945
What do Italians generally "LARP"? Stuff from back before Italy was a thing
So wars between Venice and Milan or stuff like that
Or are we talking about fantasy type stuff with orcs and shit
I'm curios, as I haven't seen the media mention it yet, how many innocents died from the airstrike
I mean, it was at an airport
The US just 9/11'ed Iraq to kill an Iranian
If Iranian Militias start doing terror in Europe as a response to the US they better stick to American Embassies and Bases or else I’d be pissed off at the European deaths that Trump would be responsible for
> organized an attack on our embassy
The US embassy in Iraq is a goddamn fortress
It's among the most protected locations in the Middle East
The protestors did some property damage to one reception area
They threw some stones
Embassy personnel responded with teargas, before Iraqi military and police forces eventually dispersed the crowd
The protestors were protesting the US killing at least 25 militia fighters, which were killed in retaliation for a rocket attack that killed one US civilian contractor
The US always responds monstrously out of proportion to any suspected attack
It's like stabbing someone in the face with a knife because you suspect they may have looked at you funny
Ok, I'll have to admit - that takes away alot of my outrage
You mean the military leader who was killed as an illegal act of war by the US
Likely in an effort to distract the US populace from the impeachment proceedings of the very guy who ordered the attack
What about him
He was part of the military of a nation which the US is at peace with
The US military killed him
If Danish military forces planted a bomb that killed General [Richard D. Clarke] or another US military leader, or for that matter any US citizen, would you not also consider that an illegal act of war
You may consider him a legitimate target
The emotional part of me doesn't really disagree, as he was clearly not an upstanding citizen
But in terms of international law, this is as much a war crime as Japan attacking Pearl Harbor in peace time was
Not that the US has ever cared much for obeying international law unless it directly benefits them
The Hague conventions of 1899 and 1907, which were used to convict Nazi leaders at the Nuremberg trials, and to the same effect in the Tokyo War Crimes tribunal, which recognized the attack on Pearl Harbor as a war crime, amongst many others
Furthermore, the international community at large agreed back then that a country does not need to have ratified the treaty in order to be bound by it, or punished for violating it
Article III of the convention of 1907 states that hostilities must not commence without explicit warning
What we today call a declaration of war
The contents of the treaties have largely been covered by other treaties which came after them, such as the Geneva conventions, but they are still valid and legally binding documents which most existing nations, including the US, have signed and ratified
The US military struck Iranian military personnel
That is an attack on Iran, as much as killing a US general and his aides would be
And he may have been funding, helping, organizing terrorist groups
He probably did
He's probably the scum of the Earth
The world is probably a better place without him
But no, funding, helping, organizing terrorist groups is not an act of war
Not according to any internationally recognized treaty, anway, which is kind of the only thing we have that reasonably codifies what is and isn't an act of war
Anyway, I should probably stop posting about this now before I waste my entire weekend away on this depressing topic
Hope you have a good one :)
Russia
Fucking Germans
Fucking Swedes, always ruining everything
If not them, Russia or the US
Germany, again
Sweden gets offended by a joke, then crosses Øresund and tries to kill everyone
Honestly
Russia
i mean, the odds are near 0
they are completely out-gunned vs NATO
but they are constantly "poking around" near sweden - and sweden is not part of NATO for some reason
and i would assume that Denmark would consider an invasion of sweden, an invasion of Denmark, more or less
i certainly would
don’t worry, the Danes aren’t wild anymore, we won’t even speak to each other when getting out of our window seat on the bus
I can’t remember the last time I had eye contact with a Dane, they always avoid conflict:)
I wonder what it will take for them to go back to the Viking days
“Some tourist is walking on the bike lane - be prepared to get E.X.E.C.U.T.E.D.”
We're woke now, though, so just the pillaging this time around
.......how
I guess were screwed over here then
This is too true, I usually take the bus to school & just lift my bag on to my lap to get out
BAM
Right in the head and anschluss
It was, though
I dont think it is likely, but it is the most likely possibility
Who else
USA
China
Sweden
Ok, I was thinking it would involve an obscene amount of tunneling
Hotel
“Cheap food” and “Denmark” doesn’t go together
Will still cost like four dollars for one single hot dog
At least
Don't know if there's a song in particular, but the artist Kim Larsen was top of his game for 50 years, he tried to break through outside Denmark but it didn't work out
A lot of danish rap is pretty dope
My personal nomination would be this: [Jeg vil la' lyset brænde] or maybe [Vågner i natten]
Farlig Fredag with Onani (masturbation)
Toscana dromedar - Jacob Taarnhøj
If I can answer on behalf of another country, [this] parody of [Drank en Drugs] is an absolute banger
Vai Amor by Gilli, its a dope rap track that absolutely blew up in Denmark, but probably won’t get international recognition
That's gotta be Kim Larsen, a legendary muscician who sadly passed away in 2018
If I had to choose the most catchy one it would be [Køb Bananer (Buy Bananas)]
Bannlyst by Gåte
Not from Denmark, its in Norwegian
Rasmus Seebach
He's a danish songwriter, and one of, if not the best at writing love songs
> Der Komissar
> is a fucking jam
Pretty sure there's even an English cover that charted overseas
> I also love Major Tom
> , great piece of 80s New Wave
Mate, both these songs topped the charts in several non-German speaking countries in the 80s.
Yeah, literally everyone in Denmark loves him, and I’m sure the rest of the world would too if they knew the language
I didn't even know Norway had afterski songs (though it makes sense)
I've always only ever known the German afterski songs
Very different type of music, but fun fact: once in a blue moon a dutch artist will have a hit or two in Denmark with songs in Dutch
Lil Kleine had a few, for example
Sure i do
Ill just throw some of the ones i listen to at you
Culo by Gilli
Verden Vender by Gilli
PUB G by Branco
Protokol by Jamaica
Parkour by Jimillian
Gaden by Fouli
Safari by Molo
Skejsen by Molo
Bølgen by Molo
Dedikeret by Molo
I Got some more ill post Them if you like these
If you’re more to a different kind of rap ill find Them just tell me :)
What type of rap would you prefer
I'd say more popular artist right now could be things like Ukendt Kunstner, Siivas, KESI, Gili, Artigeardit and Benny Jamz
Things I grw up with would be artist like Natasja, Bikstok Røgsystem, Jøden, Kasper Spez and Per Vers
Honorable mentions to Den Gale Pose, LOC, Jokeren and Suspekt (because I know people older than be will be annoyed if I didn't mention them)
Yea depends what kinda rap you want
All the really popular artists are pretty much nothing like American rap
However there are some who remind of eminem and the like
Judging from the Wikipedia article, the German version of Der Kommisar was #7 in Australia and it looks as if it did better than the English version did in the US
I don't know enough about non-European skiing culture to say so, but it's certainly an integral part of skiing in Denmark/Austria/Germany
We have been going to ski at least once every year almost my entire life, and we always go afterskiing
In Denmark, we even have [afterskiing themed bars] even though we don't have mountains
[Nope, afterski in Denmark]
Krantenwijk and Dicterbij Je, I believe
Sorry for the shot formatting
Phone you know :)
Not really a specific accent, but he would cut the end off words
I've never heard about it used in Denmark
You're usually either allowed to bring all your notes and references to tests and examns, or you're not allowed to bring anything other than writing tools
So I guess we'd just call it "notes
Svar ark, answer paper or answer sheet
Svar ark is also something the teacher can give out so you can see if your answers were correct
Swedish has a word for it so not really
In Denmark I think it’s because 1) we just don’t do written exams and tests as much as other countries, oral exams are just as common and only start in your teen years anyway, and 2) they would literally throw you out if they caught you cheating
Just not worth it
I don't think that thing has has a name
Of course I have heard of the concept of smuggling something into an exam, but I don't think we have an well established name for a piece of paper smuggled in
Also because we just don’t have as many tests
We have as many oral exams as written tests, and we only start having them when we’re 14 ish, like once a year
Hm, I feel like cheating is just very normalized in a lot of places
Here, there would be guards circling around to see if you’re cheating
If you are, too bad, have to take an entire year over to go to university/youth education
Well cheating could easily cost you your education, so it’s just not worth it
Huh
I’ve literally never heard that
I wouldn’t correlate having a word for it with being more normalized
Yeah
At highschool/gymnasium level, I'm pretty sure  cheating will get you expelled without warning
Not worth it if you're acually interested in the education you're taking
Expelled from the school and, at least at university level, propably also be banned from reapplying at that university in the future
We don't have lockers in Denmark
We have a box in the back corner of the classroom (because we have 1 classroom, we spend all our time in, with exceptions)
So I have a green plastic box with all ny books, that I don't have to bring home for homework
Oh yeah, there is this thin in Denmark where the teachers opens a safe (yes, a real money safe) and tells us to put in our phones
Then they lock it up intil school ends
All because we have to be more "social".... The thing is, we still have our computers
So we don't need lockers, but we can "buy" one
It's just nobody does that, we use our "boxes".
Danish is the same as german
(Millioner, Milliarder, Billioner, Billiarder)
000
000 = 1 million
000
000
000 = 1 milliard
000
000
000
000 = 1 trillion/billion
funny, Danish is the same, Million and Milliard
Sorry, aren't you missing 3 k's?
My school had a tunnel system that lead to a small bunker
There were two entrances in each end of the school
I got to crawl through to the other end, but the part that went out to the bunker was too unsafe
Pretty cool I’d say
The thing that can make any man cry
Legos
We used to be huge, own and rule the north, even England for a while
Then we lost it all and remain a tiny country
We love conflicting pain upon feet
(LEGO)
Why is that tho
I always wondered why Hungary and not Denmark since we made porn legal first
V O D K A  consumption per capita
Vikings apply to Scandinavia too
When I noticed it the first time in another country I was very surprised
I have accidentally made it a habit
In my city, all the city busses have 3 sets of doors
in the rear, the middle and the front, next to the bus driver
people can enter and exit from any door they want (having a ticket is their own responsibility, the driver doesn't sell them - they gotta use an app or the machine next to the middle door)
and USUALLY people who enter or exit next to the driver say thank you, or hello(if entering)
I think a major reason why we don't do it here is because in most busses you enter through one door, near the driver, but exit through another door, far away from the driver
So if you were to thank the driver on disembarking, you'd have to yell up to them, which would be super awkward
A lot of busses have recently introduced entering and exiting from all doors (just let the people getting out through first, god damn
), so you could exit through the driver's door and say thank you on your way out, but it's still not a thing
AT MOST you say hello or smile to the driver when you enter the bus, but again, since you can now enter the bus through the middle or back doors, you never communicate with them, and it would be so, so, weird for a passenger who entered through the door furthest to the back to go all the way up to the front just to say "thank you".
Disclaimer: these are standard Copenhagen practises
Things might be done differently in other parts of the country
Yeah, the driver has a view of all doors for security/technical reasons, but I dunno, it's just odd to shout "Thanks
" as you're leaving the bus with 6 other people at your door, 8 other people are leaving at the other door, and 15 more are entering the bus, taking up most of the driver's concentration
You actually say that
How unfinnish
You need to start puzzling around with your phone, keys, whatever, without saying a thing
That’ll make them move
If I happen to be the last person on the bus at the last stop on the line, I'll say thanks/good night, but when I'm just doing my regular commute, trying to make it to my train, the last thing I'm thinking about is saying thanks to the bus driver: I just want to move along
It rimes i Danish too
Just use the norwegian words
My god our languages are just that similar
I've noticed a lot of american companies (not excluding european, though) doing unacceptable things to make the chinese market happy
my thought to all of it is that it's screwed up
I did read that letter written by the norwegian parlament member, and it describes my less emotionally-charged thoughts quite well
To me, Cyprus and Croatia are pretty cool
Outside of Europe i like New Zealand the most
I think both Australia and New Zealand have pretty nice shapes
We all know that Sweden is a huge dick
Denmark is the load and Norway is the one cell that made it
Yes, you know what they say "you can't choose your neighbors". We just got really unlucky with ours, we are taking one for the team
It’s a disgrace
As is our abandonment of them
When they speak, almost all the time, it takes are VERY long time to get rid of an accent, and they are rarely similar to the native English accents
Writing on the other hand is another ballgame, but it is still possible to notice it sometimes
Yes, most of the time its so very obvious for whom its a second vs native language
Besides danes, germans, swedes and dutch who are so very easy to spot i also noticed a lot of expat kids who study in international school take on an American english accent and its obvious that they are non-native english speakers because you wouldnt find their accent anywhere in USA
If uou really listen you can tell that even the best non-native English speaker struggle a bit to compared to a native english speaker
It is too forced compared with native speakers who just flow
No one speaks German here, so you're in luck :)
When we die in Denmark, we "stiller træskoene" which means: we place our clogs
The only thing we bite, is the sour apple, when we have no options left
can confirm that we do indeed slip out of our clogs / put them away when we die
Our numbering system
Closest relative is France, but we added further layers of encryption
It's a bit as if we looked at what Europe was doing and decided to take the worst ideas available and add some of our own bullshit on top
German puts the 1s before the 10s (three and thirty = 33), that's silly, let's do that
The French use the base-20 system (4x20 2 = 82), that's archaic and awkward, let's do that too
So now we have 82 = 2 and 4x20 - but we don't stop there, time to fuck up the pronunciation and spelling as well so that what we actually say and write is something like "2 and 4s". And when the French say 4x20 12 for 92, we looked at that, and, having admired the sheer disregard for intuitive simplicity, decided to one-up the French again by saying 2 and ½5s (two and half(way from four to) five times twenty)
Tada
Meanwhile in Norway and Sweden 82 is 8 10 2
It gets worse
Imagine you want to say “75”.
That would be “femoghalvfjerds” or “five and half of four (twenties)” with “half of four” meaning 3x20+10 (halfway to the next twenty
The part in the “()” was left out over time, but I remember my grand father still using it
We do actually use the more straight forward numbering like in English, when writing checks
Why this has never caught on I don’t know
At least I always switch to this numbering when speaking to Norwegians or Swedes
Of course though, no Dane really knows any of this until years after they are taught the numbers
While there is a (convoluted) system, it's much easier to just think of as specific words for each group of tens
as a sports shooter and gun enthusiast I have mostly envied the rules in Czechia, Switzerland and to a degree also Austria and Poland
Didn't know guns were popular in Greece
You need to stop talking so much with strangers if you want to be in the "Nordic" club
Isn't Sámi also an official language in Norway, at least up north
When we're tired of talking with you we just drop a syvoghalvfjerds and let the conversation disintegrate from there
Yup, I mean you don’t think of it as a system
You just remember them like you remember any other words
Sure, it's probably only an issue for us when we learn the numbers (little Annika probably gets that 50 is femtio a bit quicker than little Freja gets that 50 is halvtreds) and when we communicate with Scandinavians in Danish
Honestly, I think they just memorise it
Personally I never thought of it as algebra until I went to uni
Which is also why it sort of annoys me when the Swedes and Norwegians make fun of us for it
Like, do you genuinely think of 90 as "Nine tens"? Of course not
According the the official list, it's [Solhverv by Lord Siva] \- which surprised me as that song is a couple of months old by now
There are some others that are quite popular now that's newer, but since Denmark is currently fighting with youtube over copyright issues, none of them are available on YT
Lord Siva is only there because it's live
Never heard og him
The only danish Music i listen to is Rasmus Seebach
In Denmark it's definently Lolland-Falster
Sønderjylland
Its known as the most racist part
Or maybe Bornholm, because it feels completely separates from the rest of us
Jylland/jutland
I'd probably say Bornholm
I love Bornholm a lot, but it's surprisingly different from the rest of Denmark
The capital
Norway and Skåne are the two odd regions
You can come back tho
Just dig a moat or something between you and the rest of Sweden
Just surrender
I'd say Bornholm
The West coast of the Black Sea has always been a crazy ethnic patchwork
Transylvania is big though, and some regions barely have Hungarians, like Alba, Sibiu, Hunedoara and Bistrița-Năsăud counties
Hell, in Maramureș, Ukrainian is almost a more common minority language than Hungarian
It's only really Harghita and Covasna, where Hungarians are the majority
>danish occupied
Skåne was literally the Danish heartland
Danes as a people originate from there
Truth brother, but Sjælland is really weird as well
Ahh, the legendary Vaslui life
Or Sønderjylland
I agree with Bornholm
Geographically far away from the rest of the country, has the most incomprehensible dialect (considered to be a separate language by some people), has a markedly different landscape (cliffs are extremely rare in Denmark, but Bornholm has a high amount of them), and has its own long list of traditions/customs not seen anywhere else in the country
Lolland/Falster is not *that* different from rural parts of, say, Jutland
Først tager i Skåne og nu dette
Admittetly
what if we asked real nice tho
Anywhere outside of Copenhagen, mostly
Legenda nu a traversat granițele, socri mei sunt români, și stiu multe oameni in Danemarca din România, prin urmare stiu despre legenda Vasluiului :)
Wouldn’t that make Copenhagen the odd one out
Nej

Eu văd pe subul din când în când, și eu placut meme-uri de acolo mult, dar cred este un pic prea complicat, când vorbiți despre politică și altceva că nu este chestiuni simple

Pattersutter is quite popular in Denmark, and i think part of the appeal, is being bad on purpose
I would also like to submit [Vafler]
His songs are great at parties and during festivals, but that's about it
I think it's enjoyable because it's kind of funny
The one that came to mind for me was [Ben by Tessa]
[Kidd - ik lavet penge] I would also say is annoying, even though it became so popular in Denmark, it still annoys me to hear it
The amount of times I've heard the first one at after-ski this February
It was basically played at least once every hour
That man just eating next to him not giving a fuck
Im not sure Tessa is supposed to be bad
there is definitely not the same level of irony
Oh, no, I meant how Pattesutter is supposed to be bad
Tessa is just bad and not fun to listen to
I was actually
That explains so much :)
extremely popular though - even my mum knows her
We have very different ideas on what grown men look like
He's still in braces
We move out quite early compared to many other European countries, but here it’s completely fine for people of all ages to have sleepovers with the opposite sex
Both children and teenagers
The few parents who didn’t allowed it were viewed as irrational helicopter parents
I moved out when I was 18, but could have stayed longer if I wanted to
My big sister moved out when she was 18 too, because she got at job
My little sister moved out when she was 22, my little brother moved out when he was 23
Regarding having your boy/girlfriend sleeping over, my parents didn't have any problems at all
Sometimes my mom even bought condoms for us
We didn't care if other people were in the house, if we wanted to have sex we had it, we'd just be quit
I'm 19, my mom doesn't care one bit if i bring a girl over as long as i don't wake her up
Not quite twenty, but still living with my parents and have my girlfriend over all the time
It's just an unspoken rule that if the door is closed, knock
If music is playing, stay away
In both our families it's pretty much an unspoken agreement, that obviously we have sex, we just don't want to be actually seen during the act
Her mom has walked in on us once, but we all just kind of laughed at it, except for my girlfriend lol
Our son started bringing his girlfriend home for weekends when they were sixteen
I can't imagine they spent *all* the time sleeping at night, but we made sure he was well stocked up on condoms, and had faith in him being a reasonable young man
Other times he'd spend the weekend at her house, and they'd join our and her families when we vacated somewhere interesting (because who wouldn't like a free vacation with your boy/girlfriend
It was completely unnecessary to educate him on sex since schools have a "theme week" every year from (I think) sixth grade about it, but we inquired any way, and got a polite "yeah, I know
Wear a rubber yadda yadda
I have no intention of becoming a teenage dad
As for noise in the night, we made sure to swap rooms when he started showing an interest in girls, and put him in the most remote room in the house
There are two doors between that room and the living room, so if you're even slightly discrete you should be able to have a lot of mutual joy without waking the whole house
Now our daughter has moved into that room, and is enjoying it in equal measure
Edit: The house is 177 M^2 (1905 sq ft)
I also bought my teenagers bigger beds
One shares hers with a boyfriend, and the other shares his with the dog
Well, here parents are more disgusted with people who hit their kids, than with teenagers having sex
Same with my daughter
She just moved out (age 20) but have been bringing boys home for sleepovers all her life
She has always had male friends
When she became older and they were boyfriends, she would have sex with them in the house
They were fairly discrete, but sometimes we could hear a bed make noises
No big deal
Our son (age 17) is away at school but is of course equally welcome to bring home girls (or boys)
I find our danish national anthem, "Der er et yndigt land" (there is a lovely country), to be very beautiful
Don't forget having a bit of Mozart in it adds prestige
In Denmark there are always danish people in the danish households
Only the Norwegian one or is the Danish one also to be seen
I rarely see people in Denmark with a waffle iron
Yes and no
We rarely use the subpar Norwegian model I'm denmark
Here it's a mix of the different kinds, but we don't really think of them as Danish or Norwegian
They are just cheese slicers
I was thinking of the traditional [one with a wire]
It’s very common in Denmark too, but we have our own (superior totally) slicer that uses a metal string instead
Some animals and a few other things have a childish sounding equivalent that you will hear people say
Miavkat = Meow-cat
Vovhund = Woof-dog
Pipfugl = Tweet-bird
Ildebrand = Firey-fire
Futtog = Toot-train
Flyvemaskine = Literally just ''flying machine'' AKA plane
Same in Danish
You asked every single german
the words like paspas, and also you don’t say “and so on” or “etc” you say “Yemek memek” “araba maraba” it’s so funny
> because landlines are often non existant anymore
They're still around
people just don't have landline phones
lots of companies still do
and of course the government etc
You know you want it back baby
Of course
in the Kalmar union everybody is Danish
sorry I haven’t learned Turkish grammar, I just couldn’t think of what that was called
I still think it’s funny to say “araba maraba” even though you probably wouldn’t say that in school/at work, it’s still pretty normal in informal settings
We do what the Germans do, as is tradition
We can technically use "love" as a verb (We love, we have loved etc
), but no one talks that cleanly
The traditional term (not counting euphemisms similar to "make love" and "sleep with") is actually "dyrke sex" which means "(to) practice sex". Though it could technically also mean "grow sex" as "dyrke" can mean either "grow" or "practice" depending on the context
The term is dying out, however, as everybody these days says "have sex", probably due to the influence of American media/pop culture
We either
have it = Har sex
get it = Får sex
> We can technically use "love" as a verb (We love, we have loved etc
), but no one talks that cleanly
Yes, that's more a literary way of putting it
You can also say 'dyrke sex' (Practise/perform/exercise)
Can't *kyn* mean genitals too
It has that meaning in Danish
It's on a lot of food, especially popular on [Franskbrød] [Rugbrød] and also pastries such as [Frøsnapper
I doubt most people even know poppys are used for opiates
You're saying it's possible to high off poppy seeds
I think it's this one:
Fun doc
The majority of Denmark's pastry traditions are heavily influenced from Immigrated Austrian bakers in 1850, so
poppy seeds *everywhere*!
Please tell me how so I don't accidentally do it
So do we
"Agurketid"
Neither Denmark to my knowledge
"Agurk" is Danish for cucumber, but when you put it together with "tid" (time), a random 'e' just jumps in and wants to join
I have no idea what we call pickles in Danish, apparently
This is the third time I'm editing this comment because I had to fact check what I said and it turns out I was wrong both times
All I know is that I call them "syltede agurker" (meaning pickled cucumbers), but maybe we have an actual word for them, maybe we don't, we'll never know
We have something from a children's song called "bakke snagvendt". You don't really talk it, but you can say words in it
You have to word, and then you swap consonant cluster/ vowel cluster from the same place in the word (usually the first consonant cluster)
For an example, to talk backwards in danish is "snakke bagvendt", but it becomes "bakke snagvendt" when you swap the first consonant clusters
You can also do it to compound words, so missetand can become tissemand
It would be nice if Frederik III could've gotten his head out of his ass and realise that we couldn't take the Swedish Empire at its prime, and that going to war without the support of the lords is exactly what his father did during the thirty years war and that went horribly as well
That way we could've kept Skåne
Either prevent the loss in against the Prussians in 1864 or the loss against the Swedes in 1658
I would just change it so that fatass Swedish king and his whole sutpid army went straight through the ice
Would have solved a lot of issues
An alternate history in which England was in the Nordic cultural sphere instead of gravitating towards France would be very interesting
I genuinely have a hard time thinking of all the consequences - probably the Nordics would have continued to be more internationally relevant, but England's importance would have been diminished
Like it or no, the period when the monarchs of England also ruled large chunks of France did increase England's political significance
It gave England leverage on both sides of the strait, and made it a contender in the continental powerplay
A pseudo-Nordic England would probably have been a more marginal figure, more genuinely insular, with the Dover Strait constituting a substantial cultural and linguistic barrier
I think the biggest change would obviously be cultural
English folklore and myth is essentially forgotten today, because the new Norman elites had no interest in preserving it
So much was lost - I think it is telling that Shakespeare, though he wrote plays set in ancient Britain, Denmark, Italy and Scotland, wrote no plays whatsoever set in Anglo-Saxon England, which in the 16th century still constituted roughly half of all English history
I do not think Hardrada could ever have been king of England
Even if he had won at Stamford-bridge, he then would merely have found himself in Harold's stead, meeting the Normans at Hastings, save with an even more impoverished army and far fewer friendly natives
Even had he won, the pattern of England's Danish rulers indicates that the country would probably have been back to Saxon rule within a few decades
We have plenty of viking legends
Like Sigurd Orm-i-Øje, Regnar Lodbrog, Harald Hildetand etc
In denmark and basically all of scandinavia is vikings and we hear it from every one
But we are proud of out old norse forefathers
Aye, I actually never thought about this, but the Knight is our hero archetype
Makes sense thinking about King Arthur etc
Sound like the basis for Pratchett's Nac mac Feegle
Snafflin' coobeasties, an' all
Several of them are believed to be based on actual historical figures
And in their legends are a grain of truth
But the vast majority of it is fiction
There's a lot of magic
Regnar Lodbrog for instance has a lot of accomplishments to his name
But the only thing we're certain of is that there was a powerful viking chieftain named Regnar who laid siege to Paris in 845, and got a huge payment from King Charles the Bald to fuck off
And this same viking is obviously believed to be the father of "Regnar sønnerne" (the sons of Ragnar), who lead the conquest of the Danelaw
In the same sense Harald Hildetand is believed to be based on a king called Harald who ruled Denmark in 754
We don't know how long before that he became King or how long after that he remained
But Harald Hildetand is known for the battle of Bråvalla and that supposedly happened around that time
Did it come to Swedish from that time Charles XII was in exile
Just like how sarma(kåldolmere) came to Scandinavia
Tordenskjold lived like 700 years after the Viking Age had ended though
I can't speak for Swedish history, but Sigurd Snake in the eye is not considered the first King of Denmark
We know of several kings before his real life counterpart King Sigurd/Sigfred
They do indeed
His name actually sounds pretty badass in English: "Thundershield".
I, too, would be interested in a source of information about this story
But still a legend to this day
Det er sgu dyrt
In Denmark I think it was Rema1000 who said they would sell masks for 3,5 dkr which is under 0,5 eur - and then all of the other supermarkets matched that price but its not state regulated
Wish we had this in Denmark
Over here only the cheapest beers are individually priced
But the reusable masks are not as protective
Is this unique to Scotland or in the entire UK
They've brought it down to 3 kr now
Roughly two fifths of a euro
Edit: just remembered Cents exist, the price is 40 cents
a centimer spared, is a cent earned
I don't think most people would even know what it is
No, but France, along with the rest of the Allied powers, sat and twiddled their thumbs as Eastern Europe was carved up between the Nazis and the Soviets
That beer is taxed as an essential food, like in Bavaria
Nature from Switzerland, Canada, USA, Finland
Food from India and Greece
Friendliness from Bali
Mountains of the Netherlands
I’m a huge car enthusiasts and Danish car laws are royally fucked
Give me Sweden’s car laws please
Granted, you get Syria’s 50% unemployment rate
Then you will have a blast at “LEGO House” all the old models, from your childhood is on display there
You already have new Orleans
Dont be greedy
Thank you
It would, it really, really would
And thats exactly why you can’t have nice things, like french Canada
You will destroy that too lmaof
Thank you
We had a motivationel show telling us to plant trees
on the radio yesterday morning, they had a professor in biodiversity on
he said, that planting trees is a decent idea
but they're not gonna be helpful before 80-100 years
small trees do almost nothing
What show is that
What tv channel is it
> small trees do almost nothing
True
but it accomplishes something else
Gives people hope and makes them feel like they are helping change something
Also spreads awareness of the issue and gets people to think about how they reduce their carbon
I thinks it's organised by municipality
Basically:
- A municipality has an area they would like to reforest
- They sign up to the program saying "we would like to reforest this area".
- TV2 hosts a charity show where viewers can donate X amount
- After the show the charity pot is split up someway and is sent to the participating municipalities to help fund their reforestation
-ish
Never heard of it
> makes them feel like they are helping change something
But if it actually doesn't achieve that much, wouldn't it be better to find a crowdfunding project, that actually would, so people not only would feel like they help changing something, but actually *would* change something
right
lets spend our money on hope, rather than something that works "now" :)
he didn't mention anything specific unfortunately
i was annoyed by that as well
if youre serious, you can contact him here
he works for the university of copenhagen
i dont think an individual can do much
we need very large political action
like closing down coal power and such
Agreed, but I don't have all the details for the event so they might have organised an event for people to do just that in relation to the show or at the very least inspired some local communities to do it
Akvavit, snaps and beer
Us Danes love our alcohol, it's rare to see a Dane who don't drink alcohol
Akvavit and snaps is classic, us young people see it as an old people kind of alcohol
Beer is widely consumed
Beer - The modern way of producing beer was created in Denmark
Aquavit - Scandinavian culture right here
Snaps
It tastes like you were in the middle of rimming a monkey and then it farts in your face
Snaps and it tastes awful
We drink it on holidays mostly
I don’t think you can categorize ‘snaps’ and ‘aquavit’ as two different things
Snaps isn’t a special kind of alcohol but the term for taking a shot of aquavit (in Denmark) during the course of a meal
There has obviously come a new term where we use it for spirits that basically aren’t aquavit, but they are
Horincă and palinca - the same as the above, just distilled to a higher alcohol level
Aquavit was first mentioned when the Danish lord of Bergenshus castle wrote a letter to Olav Engelbrektson, the last Roman Catholic Arcbishop of Norway in 1531
Almost exclusively consumed in Scandinavia, as well as a bit in Germany
Aquavit does not taste good, but I do enjoy it for the tradition and tool of bringing people together
> there are whiskies produced on the Scottish islands which still use peat within the malting process,
I think you mean "deliberately" use peat
When you say they "still" use peat, it sounds like it's out of necessity, whereas it's the whole point of Islay whisky, that it has those peaty flavours
I remember sharing a bottle of unicum with a friend on a train to the city
That stuff looks rank when you throw it up
Ah, the modern way of culturing pure yeast was developed in Denmark, but that's about it
Swap the spoon for a coin, and you have the recipe for kaffepunch
Chartreuse has a cult following in my town
The rumours say the French café that popularised it here is the place that sells the most chartreuse in the world
Looks like a health potion
Not sure whether you are making a joke or referring to the spelling hmmm
Which is the foundation of creating beer, wouldn’t you agree
The term varies, which is why I specified Denmark
IIRC He (Eske Bille) was controlling the amt for 10ish years, he was part of the “Bille” family which has an immense amount of power in both Norway and Denmark at the time
I think we have different views on what constitutes "necessity". Peat is used and is necessary for making an islay whisky, the same way chocolate is needed for a chocolate cake
But my point is that it's part of the design, and not because they can't dry their malts through other methods
I wouldn't say that some bakers still use chocolate to make their cakes
It of course came out of necessity, as timber was scarce on the windy Hebrides, but now it's a sought-out feature, and not a bug
The research done at the Carlsberg labs in the late 19th century was important for modern beer brewing, no doubt, but I feel like you brush over how basically everything else about the brewing at Carlsberg was German, from lagering as well as cold fermenting, which are two definite Bavarian brewing traits
I see, I welcome all jokes alcohol related
No, because English is pretty close to Danish
Things that many non-native English speakers complain about, such as it not being phonetic, or the pronunciation being awkward and all over the place, are the same in Danish
If not actually worse
I think that’s definitely a reason as to why we’re often ranked such good English speakers
So far English is the easiest language I have learned (the others being Danish and German)
I haven't had a big problem with it, no
Only thing I have an issue understanding and learning is German
I had a shitty teacher for a year (didn't learn shit), then i got stuck since
When summer rolls around, it'll be 3 years of me not learning a single thing in german
I've found it quite easy, in comparison to the tiny bit of German i speak
Even though German and English isn't that far off from each other
English is quite easy tbh, I've been decent at it for a while
Although when I look back at my youtube comments or just anything in general, I can see that I have improved drastically
I even cringe when I look back at it because I thought I was so damn good at English back then, but holy fuck
Playing video games and DnD made it a piece of cake to learn English, also a lot of words are similar so
Sort of the same, I learnt some of the MOST basic english when I started playing games, so when english rolled around to start in school, I was just going ahead of the class
Yeah, and you guys have a lot of French loanwords
Your word for ice cream for example
Yes
We find Swedish and Norwegian translations for words like “computer”, “teenager”, “tablet” and stuff really funny
Just feels so out of place
I mean, yeah
We have lended a few words from them
> Don’t you also have loan words that you haven’t changed
I’m pretty sure you just say “computer” and “elevator”, whereas here in Sweden we have our own Swedish words for those
That must at least help a bit with English vocabulary, right
It's a myth that Danish has more English loanwords than Norwegian and Swedish
It's just that in Danish loan words tend not to change their spelling
'Lunsj' in Norwegian is just as much a loan word as 'weekend' in Danish
You tend to notice the English loanwords when you listen to the other Scandinavian language if their loanwords are different
For instance, I notice 'lunsj' and 'kløtsj' in Norwegian and 'attackera' and 'cupen' in Swedish
You might notice 'computer' and 'software' in Danish
that's harsh
but yes our numbers are dumb asf
Damn I’d definitely have thought that sjåfør (we spell it chauffør) was a joke if you hadn’t mentioned it
That’s the type of spelling we’d use to indicate that someone is stupid and can’t spell lol
It's just something I heard in a radio programme a couple of years ago about differences in the Scandinavian languages, you can hear it here:
I guess it's just because you recognise english loan words immediately as loanwords when you hear them in Danish
But yeah, words from French and Low German are far more common
Angribe/attackera is a good example (should have checked that one
Passé simple isn't very common though
You mainly see it in written French
And even though every verb can be conjugated in many forms, most are regular, so you just need to learn 3 systems
Gunnuts arguing that their amount of easily accessible guns has nothing to do with homicide rates or school shootings
No more people that are shit at geography
Imo that is still a poor argument
You also have sparsely populated places in Europe where the police can take a long time to get there
I'm sure that you'd be able to find such places in Sweden - maybe even Austria with your mountains
Maybe you can find places that fits that in almost all countries in Europe - some countries has more or such areas than others
The fact that the American society is *overflowing* in guns does nothing good
There has been far too many school shootings, gun related crimes and gun related accidents
I also suppose that this has a say in why the American police can be quite trigger happy; everybody could have a gun so they're taking no chances
Anyway, I don't think that easily accessible guns are good for anybody
Your grandfather must have been a real globetrotter
Copenhagen = København
Cape Town = Kapstaden
Cologne = Køln
Venice = Venedig
Outside of a few, in Danish we generally keep the same word for the city as in their respective countries' native language
Examples:
Moscow = Moskva
Warsaw = Warszawa
Florence = Firenze
Belgrade = Beograd
We haven't ever translated an English city into Danish as far as I know
I am trying really hard to think of any but i just can't find one that is completely different
On the other han i can tell you we have a city called Nyborg which translated to English is Newcastle
As in Newcastle upon Tyne
I think that apart from Copenhagen and Elsinore (Helsingør) all cities in Denmark are called by their native name in English
I think in Elsinore’s case it’s due to Hamlet, but don’t know
Weirdly, the Swedish city just across the water (Helsingborg) has never been called Elsinburg
Copenhagen in Danish is København, which litterally means "Buy-a-habour"
To share a few more:
Nyborg would be "Newcastle"
Middelfart would "Average speed"
Did you forget Copenhagen/København ? :D
Helsingør / Elsinore
The only other city I can think of except Copenhagen is Helsingør/Elsinore
Otherwise we'll have to compare cities in Jutland with their German names, Haderslev/Hadersleben etc
Probably, but due to lenition it would've been called "Jorvig" today
That means if we were to be translating New York into Danish it would be "Ny Jorvig"
Edit: FYI, no one in Denmark calls York "Jorvik".
Yeah but thats boring :)
Twenty Øne Piløts as well
Jeg tror det er fordi de er misundelige på vores seje bogstaver
Copenhagen functioned as a toll point
Every ship who wanted to get in or out of the Baltic Sea through Øresund had to pay a fee to the danish crown
I’d imagine Copenhagen was named after the Baltic Sea because it functioned as a gate to get in and out
It was more so Helsingør and Helsingborg from what I recall
Could be wrong though
krak
dk is probably the most commonly known
It has more acurate toponyms and better quality ortophotos
Otherwise there is openstreetmap
I sometimes use topographic maps in Denmark
More detailed for hikes and nature trips
For 1 DKK you can get 2 packs of yeast and basically nothing else lol
For 10 you get a liter of milk, and for 100 you could get one of the cheap meals at McDonald's
Well I don't think there's really anything that I know of and would be interested in buying that costs 1 kr
However most lollipops costs 3,5 kr
if that counts
For 10 kr
I can buy a bag of potatoes from the neighboring farm and for 100 kr
I can buy a main dish from most chain Cafes/Restaurants like Zeros, Vivaldi or Cafe X.
For 1kr you can't really buy anything
Half a bolt in a hardware store or half a chewing gum (singular) in a gas station
For 10kr you can buy a Snickers
For 100kr you can buy a decent wine or a Vietnamese takeaway curry
Is the bag price because there's no government mandated price for plastic bags
But how much snus
...I should go to Romania for dinner
You consider that cheap
The price of milk has risen by like 50% in the last 5 years
I used to drink milk because I liked it, but now I only use it when I have to because I think it's gotten too expensive
I was still annoyed at the previous price increase when they raised it the most recently
Anything more than 1€ is too much
I think he meant, it's a cheap meal at a restaurant in Denmark
But you are correct, 100 DKK could get you one of the biggest menus at mcd
Our plastic bags are 4,5 dkk
No, that's a good price in a normal store
That price is similar to here as well
I live way out in the country side so the neighboring farm just happens to sell potatoes and eggs, so we buy those things from there and they're so cheap because they only sell them because they're excess from what the family can realistically eat
I don’t know if my definition of cursive is different, or we simply stopped teaching it early here in Scandinavia, but I am 40 years old and it was never taught in school
I am pretty sure it was taught when my parents went to school, but these days it’s really only old people who still use it, and I personally have a hard time reading cursive as it often just looks like a bunch of squiggels
I really haven’t had any experiences with scammers, or beggars doing weird stuff, except for the homeless immigrants in Copenhagen
One of them once yanked a bottle out of my hands
I know that’s nothing, but I don’t recall experiencing anything worse
It is not something that is commonly eaten here, but it is not seen as wierd
Terrible
I don't like seafood at all
Maybe fish and chips once in awhile
Lolland, the danish version of Alabama
Randers
Randers, a city of about 60K people in Jutland
It goes that people from Randers all drive on scooters, wear Nike Shoxs shoes and drink mokai
Probably Sweden since we’ve had so much history together
Lolland, the entire island of Funen for literally being a bridge between Denmark and Jutland, Western Juland and Southern Juland for being like Alabama
And there are soooo many Danish memes about taking Scania back
I feel like most people would happily make scania danish again
We’ll take back our trash thanks :)
Southern Jutland is also the danish version of Alabama
I wonder if that gonna change in the future once the island goes from being a dead-end remote corner of the country to the transport middle point between Copenhagen and Hamburg
At least the name will remain, that's the important part
mOkAi
Good luck here :)
“Lolland (Danish pronunciation: [ˈlɒˌlænˀ]; formerly spelled Laaland, literally "low land") is the fourth largest island of Denmark, with an area of 1,243 km2
Yup
Don’t forget its Latin name: Lalandia
Really
Vent er det der Lalandia kommer fik sit navn fra
Netop
Lalandia startede på Lolland, så derfor skulle verdens bedste feriested navngives så.
There is not really anything they do beter then where i live now
I could
But only after i have finished all of my education here and gotten a good chunk of work experience under my belt
Computer Engineers get a pretty good salary over there i believe, so i’d be fine, unlike a lot of other people who were born into the crappy system there
Permanently, probably not
But i would be open to living there for a couple of years
I don't think I could ever live in USA
I love to visit though, been there a few times at conferences
I’m studying to become an engineer, so getting a job with a good insurance and benefits probably wouldn’t be too difficult, but it would feel so wrong for me to live a (relatively) lush lifestyle knowing people are living without homes or food just down the street - with little to no chance of getting help
Needing a car in order to get anywhere is also a big fat no in my book
I’d like to visit some time though
No not really
In general I dont know if I want to permanently leave Denmark, but I would like to live abroad for a few years through a job
While I would not say no to the US, I would prefer somewhere in East/Southeast Asia
If i could live in the US i would choose to live in California in a city like Santa Barbara
I like the spanish colonial architecture of California
The climate is perfect for me and i like to live near the sea
But i would only wanna live there if i had a good well paying job + health care insurance
I love to visit and go to a lot of places there, but I wouldn't want to live there, at least not permanently
The (lack of) healthcare system alone would keep me from moving there - especially with children
Gun laws and the educational system would concern me aswell
&#x200B;
If I had an attractive job offer in a safe area I might consider moving as a single adult
Yeah but it would be even better IF we reconquered Scania
And mämmi
I'm not sure, but liberal in Danish means conservative party (Republican)
Why are you opposed to comprosises
I'm curious
Isn't that the whole point with our multi-party system, that any government has to compromise with parties on both sides, to best represent the entire population
Genuinly curious
I can work 7 or 0 days in a week, my choice
I really think you are mis-representing and generalizing liberals in Denmark
What does pro-labour even mean
No party in Denmark is against good conditions for working people, and certainly no party is against the welfare state
In fact, many of them want to relieve taxes from working people, meaning they have more money and running a business overall becomes cheaper, you could argue that is pro-labour
The liberal parties (namely LA, V and K) mainly run on a platform of personal freedom, and then an acknowledgement of what makes the welfare state possible in the first place: private businesses and innovation (they are the vast majority of the GDP), thus wanting better conditions for them
None of them want a worse welfare state
> And I dont believe the point of a multi-party system is compromise
Compromise often is a result of multi-party systems, but it isn't, and shouldn't be, the rule
> This means that when I am talking about being pro-labour, I am talking about the ideologies that are not the dominant ideology, not the superstructure, but rather are pro-labour in that they aim for a change in ideology from a liberal ideology to an ideology for the continuation of the emancipation of the labouring class
Let me ask you like this then: How, in your view, is the labouring class not emancipated yet
In my view, emancipation of the labouring class, and the personal freedom that modern liberalism promotes go hand in hand
> I am saying that in the broadest meaning of the word 'liberalism' I am opposed to that certain ideological direction
Of course, that is understandable
This is, I presume, the same way I am opposed to the ideological direction of Socialism
This is a natural effect of people being different, and why I was initially curious when I read your original comment as you opposing compromises
I suppose there is not need in arguing semantics, or even ideologies
Originally I was mostly curious, since I (probably mis-read) your comments as being opposed to compromises
As you can probably guess, I am mostly centre-right, but I believe the key to a successful democracy is one, where everybody's opinion matters, and thus comprosises is at the core of the process and an extremely important part of how the country is run
I think it is very normal here to be open about pregnancies and giving birth, my mom have been pretty open about it and I work with mostly women who aren't afraid to talk about both in a positive and negative way
Yeah and quite openly
It is not a big deal in Denmark
New moms  are put together with other new moms and meet up to exchange sstories/support
It's not too intimate to ask if you know the person and have a good reason to be curious
Can't just randomly ask an aunt at the buffet how giving birth felt
My SO talked a lot with her friends about it before her first child
Having witnessed a child birth I get that it can be too much of personal experience involving too much of your private parts to share with anyone, but it's clearly also a major event in life and an unusual ordeal to endure
After birth every first time mother is invited to join a "mom group" and from what I understand talking about the pregnancy and its culmination is the major topic
Agree
You get all the details all the time
And it's ok
Kebab pizza is probably the most popular one in Denmark too
Some call it Saladpizza but the ingredients are usually the same

Danija is a beautiful name for Denmark
Cool
I'm sure it's equivalent (and probably inherited from) Latin -ia, as in Russia, Dania, Italia, etc
In Danish we have our own equivalent, -en, which is used in place of it (Prussia is Prøjsen, Italia is Italien, etc)
The only one I can think of right now, is a bar in Århus called "Bar her og der" which both means "Bar here and there" as well as "Just here and there", which is a common answer to say when people ask you where you are/have been
I've been there
It's really great
Everybody should go there
You should go there
For Iceland its the Edda, written in the 13th century
Asgard, Rangnarök, Thor, Odin and all that jazz
Not to my knowledge
Some authors and works stand out from the rest though
Most kids in Denmark know some of the fairy tales by Hans Christian Andersen, like "The Emperor's New Clothes", "The Little Mermaid", "The Nightingale", "The Steadfast Tin Soldier", "The Princess and the Pea", "The Snow Queen", "The Ugly Duckling" and so on
As you get a bit older, you would most likely read some plays by Ludvig Holberg (1684-1754), who is known as the founder of modern Danish literature
His comedies are still often played at lots of theaters around the country
The most famous ones are probably "Jeppe paa Bjerget" and "Erasmus Montanus".
Later on, you might study the philosophical works of Søren Kierkegaard, but most Danes probably haven't read them
If you are a Christian and visit the Danish church, maybe you will notice that many of the psalms that are sung, are written by an author called N. F. S. Grundtvig
He wrote more than 1500 psalms, 253 if which is in the standard book of psalms in the Danish church today, and religious or not - I don't think it is possible to grow up in Denmark without ever having heard some of them
Most famous is probably: "Et barn er født i Betlehem", "Dejlig er den himmel blå", "Det er så yndigt at følges ad", "Hil dig, Frelser og Forsoner" and "Nu falmer skoven trindt om land". He was pretty influential in the 19th century and while he is today mostly known for his psalms and the schools he founded, he actually also made the first full translation of Beowulf into a modern language in 1820 and from that point on was very inspired by old Anglo-Saxon literature
As an honorable mention, the stories from the Nordic Mythology about Odin, Thor and the rest of the old Gods are also popular here, as in the rest of the Nordic countries
It’s put together from bits and pieces (depending on the version) and written in a very old prose hundreds of years ago
But read the secondary literature to understand it and it’s context
Wild deer wander in to our yard at the summer house, which is close to a forest
Also hares and foxes
In Copenhagen there are a lot of foxes, which you sometimes see
Domesticated cats are everywhere
yeah you often find deer (and hares) near houses (think summerhouses) far from cities
My concerns have more to do with the treatment  of migrants workers and that FIFA seemingly doesn’t care at all despite being fully aware of it
The price for the construction of the stadium are  human lives
probably several thousands by now
Agreed
Every liberal democrstic country should boycot it
I honestly don't know, and I don't understand it either
I much prefer northern dishes to southern dishes
I will agree that southern dishes *look* fancier though with a lot more colors etc
due to the variety of vegetables, fruits etc
they have down there
Maybe that is the reason
The natural variety in produce
Back in the day you'd have a real problem growing a lot of the things we regularly use in dishes today in large parts of northern Europe
Things needed to be able to survive the winters, periods with a lot of rain, little sunlight etc
in the more northern parts
Growing up, my father (Who i lived with for most of the time) cooked
he mostly cooked classic danish food
in his kitchen kabinet he had:
Salt
Pepper
that's it
i mean, the food was fine
but
my mother uses like spices from all over the world
these days, i only use salt
Name a culture where food doesn’t play an important role, though
> Also, idk if a fact, but imo the soil down south is richer in minerals and makes for tastier fruits and vegies
Also, it stays warmer for more of the year
Longer growing seasons matter more
> Not to mention the most complex, long-fermented beers in the world (Belgian, German, British
even the Baltics do amazing underrated things with dark lagers and stouts)
Outside of Germany, most of these cultures primarily use ale yeasts, which are quick fermenters, except for the spontaneously fermented lambics and Flemish red ales in Belgium
Also traditionally, you would find complex brewing cultures in all of Northern Europe, but since they were based on the individual farms, they have almost died out after industrialisation and urbanisation in the mid-19th century
Hell, even Germany used to have a lot more diversity in their beer landscape, with Western German beers being closer to Belgian and Dutch beers, while Northern German beers were closer to Scandinavian beer, but this took a blow, when Germany was united and their style of brewing was heavily restricted because of the adoption of Bavarian legislation(Reinheitsgebot), which favoured traditional Bavarian brewing
Nowadays you can still find some old dudes in Norway's rural side making beer like they always did, with yeast cultures that in some examples have been kept alive since medieval times, and thanks to primarily one man, who toured the area a few years ago, West Norwegian yeasts(kveik) are some of the most hyped yeasts in homebrewing circles and among smaller breweries
In case you are interested, you can read more about it on [this blog
He also later goes to Lithuania and Estonia, and documents their traditional brewing cultures
I guess I understand it but I really dislike how smug they act about it
And how snobbish they often are about food in general, with each other especially
Eh, for some foods, butter is way better than olive oil
The milk proteins and lactose in butter just contribute in a way, which no oil does
> A lot of our food is not mass produced, in a lot of mediterranian countries what you guys consider "organic food" - its just considered "food".
[Yeah buddy, that's just like straight up not true
It's all to do with the fact, that it's warmer, which allows for more kinds of vegetables and fruits to be grown
I wouldn't say that dining time is the absolute highlight of the day in the north - at least not in a regard higher than "yay, time to fill the belly"
I think the problem is that it tastes like fish
I absolutely hate fish
It doesn't smell like something you should eat
I would eat so much more fish if the prices for it were better, or if I had better fish shops nearby
> They tend to get rather creative with their recipes and choice of produce from what I've experienced
But most adhere very strictly to the foraging movement, and only makes it with things you realistically can find in Scandinavia
It's basically why ramson all of a sudden got super popular to use
Yeah paella is bland af
Yeah or Mexican, Thai, Vietnamese or *real* Chinese food
Salt is a mineral tho, spices come from plants
Still doesn’t mean it’s unimportant
I find that cooking and good food is pretty important in Denmark, and our national dishes really adds to our sense of Danish-ness
Fresh fish in general should only smell like salt water, if fish smells, it's has started to go bad, [and produce this very foul smelling amine]
>Other cultures similarly poor in resources or variety of foodstuffs available could do much with very little, even often in the way of ritual
No where in the world has people lived so north in such high numbers as Northern Europe and Russia, so I don't really know what you are comparing to
Inuits in Canada, Alaska and Greenland
Their cuisines are also primarily hunted meat and fish, that has been fermented or dried
I'm really interested in knowing what your examples are
If you read the source, they mention several cook books from the late 15th century
Eh, you could also grow way more food and vegetables than many places in Northern Europe
Try to grow tomatoes in Denmark without a greenhouse
Your output is going to suck
Yeah, but in the south good food is life or death
It's incredible how much time and energy they spend on it; I've learned that there is no such thing as 'just food' down there
Guess I've never had a fresh fish then
Don't feel like I'm missing anything, bad smelling fish has ruin it for me
But I don't see why they should be critiqued for being creative with the native resources
You are going to a restaurant, aren't you expecting to get something better or more interesting than you can cook yourself
Food is not set in stone, it's always evolving
There was a time, when lasagna, or screw that, anything with tomato was not really representative of Italian food, but try to open a restaurant, that only serves broccoli, and see how well it goes
Do you also go to a concert and criticise the orchestra for playing more complex music, than what most people know how to play or compose
Okay, there are a lot of things to address here, I don't even know where to begin
First of all, most mountains ranges have low valleys, and most are not so vast, that there are no lowlands nearby
Take for example Nepal, the country of Mt
Everest and the Sherpas
Sure, they have areas with mountains that dwarf any other mountain in the world, [but significant parts of the country are less than a 100 metres above sealine] and many parts of the country [are comparable to Spain in terms of height] and [guess where most people live
Yeah that's right, in the low, non-mountainous parts of the country or the valleys]
The Andes, and specifically Peru and Chile [were some of the areas were agriculture independently began] and Peru is home to more different kinds of potato and tomato than anywhere else in the world, how do you combine that with the theory, that they should be limited in what crops they can grow
It's literally where we got shitload of our most popular crops from
And plus a lot of their popular dishes are born out of the Spanish Empire, since there's no other way they could have pork and cows
Moving on to Russian cuisine
Russian culture was historically centred in what now is Ukraine and Southern Russia, around Moscow, [and it's also where most people live today] and if you look at this [map of Europe] if you see that brown-red colouring, that is all over Ukraine and Southern Russia, that represents the soil type called "chernozem" which means black soil, and is known as one of the most fertile soil types there is, and it's one of the regions that grow the most grain in the World
And the final thing, [here's a map of Japan, that you used as an example as a comparable place to Scandinavia earlier] I placed a marker smack dab in Tokyo, and if you see on the right map, you can see that it lies on the latitude as Tangier in Morocco
Sure it gets colder in Japan than in Morocco, but the daylight is way more evenly distributed there, than in Scandinavia, where there are places, where you basically don't see the sun for between 3 and 6 months
[The same is true for Nepal] and [a big part of the Andes Mountains are in the Tropics]
Poland has great food
Żurek is also underrated
It honestly makes sense that Americans mix us up all the time, even if they do it for the wrong reasons
Again, where exactly did you expect the culture to come from
It's a thing that takes generations to develope
But even then, we are doing pretty well nowadays, if you've never had modern Danish haute cuisine, try it
In Danish its “Det tysk-romerske rige” -roughly translates to “The german-roman Empire”
Det Hellige Tysk-romerske rige (Holy German-romam empire)
>The German-Roman ~~Empire~~ Realm
Only ever encountered it without hellige/holy
Yes
Rige is somewhere in between empire and realm, but not really either
We have *kejserrige* in Danish or *imperie*, but *rige* is a general and broad definition same as realm in English and reich in German
So a littoral translation of *rige* would be realm, but yes in a more correct context it should be understood as *kejserrige* (empire)
I actually choose the word empire based on the fact there was a proclaimed emperor, even though the title did not align In power with the title of emperor in the previous Roman empire
No, not really
Among the younger generation it's also quite common to see English words conjugated using Danish grammar
So for instance, "I accidentally liked his picture" would be "jeg kom til at like hans billede" instead of "jeg kom til at syntes godt om hans billede"
I feel Denmark and Norway are always at battle when it comes to this
In Denmark we took the approach of basically accepting every loan word, whereas in Norway they made new words
Example:
English: Tablet (like an iPad)
Danish: Tablet
Norwegian: Nettbrett
I've even heard a joke in Denmark about the word for sleeping bag in Norwegian is kropskondom (body condom)
Ofc that's not true, but if I told that to a fellow Dane, there would be good chance of them believing it
Not as far as I know
With these things you need to be ahead of the foreign adoptions instead of a corrective force afterwards, at least in my country people aren't gonna stop saying "computer" even if there's an official push for a replacement
Back in the 90s when a lot of IT related words were new or only recently widely used, there should have been an official effort to provide well thought out Danish alternatives, instead it was a jungle where competing Danish versions were more often than not rather awkward and lengthy, which only assured we would generally just go with the English words
At any rate, if you take a bird's eye view of language it's impossible to maintain the idea that loan words are inherently bad and should be avoided
My own language has been particularly enriched by German (about 17% of the words in a random Danish text came from German), and it feels a bit a-historical or ignorant to see the current adoption of English words as anything but natural language evolution - after all no one is today complaining about "arbejde", "altså", "virkelig", "bevidsthed" etc as German loan words ruining Danish
No but we do have a meme page where English is forbidden  @dankmark
>Skriðdreki = tank (military)
Haha, sounds almost like the Danish word "Skidrik" (Skithrik) which is a slightly outdated word for an arsewhole or bastard
Kind of makes sense ;)
In a lot of software programs I will generally use the English language option because I spend more time thinking about the intention of a setting/button when it’s translated into Danish
Yes
The grammar of verbs is usually translated to Danish
In nouns we often keep the english grammar for plural, like in tank, tanks
But we make up our own form for determite plural which english doesn’t have (the tanks) we use danish grammar, tanksene/tankene
Yes :D
In Denmark people are split between pronouncing weekend as "Vikend" or "Wikend". I only ever hear people from Sjælland, mainly people from Copenhagen, pronouncing it the latter option, the same pronunciation as in English
I was told by an English speaker that I (and most Danes, according to him) have a habit of using "learned" when we should be using "was taught", due to Danish using "lært" for "was taught". Since he pointed it out I've caught myself doing it once or twice, so it's certainly a thing I do
I also have a hard time spelling the word "definitely" so in general, I try to avoid using it - often rephrasing sentences to do so
Prepositions are tough
I just edited a comment 3 or 4 times because I wasn't sure I used the correct one
I'm still not sure, I used the right one
Also used to and use to
They almost always feel like the wrong one and that it should be the other
It's funny, because in Danish it seems to be English influencing Danish
We also write compound words as one word ('bildør' for car door), but a lot of Danes have started splitting up the compound words in Danish, so they would say 'bil dør', which is wrong
I saw a rule for spelling necessary
A shirt has one Collar(c) and two Sleeves(s) and both are necessary
It somehow stuck onto my brain and now I can spell necessary
Unfortunately not, I'd maybe remember that it's a combination of 'selv' (self) and 'følge' (follow) and 'lig' (equal (to) or corpse) and then spell those three separately
It means "of course" but some things can also be a 'selvfølge' which means that of course you have this thing, of course you deserve it
I don't know if there's an English word for that though
I don't think we have one of those tbh, I certainly can't think of anyone who's idolized to that degree
We obviously have our football "heroes", actors etc
but I wouldn't say it's anywhere near the level of idolization that JP II seems to have in Poland
Queen Margrethe is liked by most
Maybe not idolized though
Yes, Ludovici Orban is a different guy
Probably not as much as in the anglosphere, but I'm sure it exists
In Denmark there's been a big antivaxx movement
Not so much because people think it cause autism, but that it makes people sick
Especially a few years back when girls +13 could get cervix cancer vaccinations, and there were a few cases of girls (of course not related to the vaccine shot) got very ill, seemingly after having gotten the vaccine
Climate change deniers is also big, also in the parlament
I think flat-earthers is the rarest, they dont get any kind of puplic recognition if they exist
Not nearly to the same extent as you see from the USA but it does exist
I haven't encountered any Danish flat earthers but there are other nutters out there
What's interesting is that climate change seems to be more of a "I don't *want* it to be true so I just deny it
" kinda thing from staunch capitalist types etc
and I'm not even convinced that *they* believe it themselves, it seems to be about adherence to the ideology and not actual conviction
On the other hand the """""health"""""" stuff seems to be from (relatively) far left types
The gluten avoiding, cell phone causing cancer, "Natural = Healthy", antivaxx, "ohhh scary GMO
" type stuff mostly seems to be left wing nonsense from my experience
Obviously there are exception to both types of nonsense but that seems to be the general trend
Another interesting thing is that most of the right wing climate change stuff seems to be done by men, while most of the hippie-health-delusion crap seems to be done by women
Again, this is obviously only from my own experience and exceptions exist here as well
Nah, our idiots belive in clima change stuff, but
they're just sometimes kind of stupid
Average stupid people in denmark
Oh they are here, sadly
He has a point
If you can think for yourself
"Experts" say and "sources" say are often just something papers use to back some claim up that can easily be false
I guess Russia will be Russia, but not much else
We forgive you
But can we please have Holstein back
We look weird without it
I'd say a good 50% of the subs I subscribe to I can't relate to 90% of the posts
The only subs where I can relate to are subs that are inherently international, and in many of those there are many posts I still can't relate to because they focus on an American perspective
All of the internet in America-centric
The amount of times I've gotten into discussions with Americans who just couldn't see that their reality isn't mine
Well
It more than I can be bothered to count
Especially when it comes to, as a woman, discussions on feminism and inequality, Americans seems to equate their everyday life with being similar in all of the western world
And it just isn't. And if you point out that many of their issues simply doesn't exist in places like Denmark, they freak and tell you, you're in denial or anti-feminism
I'm not, I just don't think their agenda is universal
However, the only subreddit it actually annoys me is here on AskEurope
So many Americans answering the subs and try and make it about America
Listen, you have the rest of the internet
Let us have our own space please and stop trying to make everything about you
On any sub that's dominated by Americans you'll feel "alienated" quite often from my experience
They just seem to see a lot of things completely differently than others, seem to do certain things in their own ways etc
which means a lot of the answers on /r/AskReddit etc
just don't apply to anyone but Americans and yet they're upvoted like made making it seem like it's some universal truth
You also regularly see people using example from the USA, American history etc
to "explain" things in other parts of the world when in fact it's USA that has an extremely unusual and special history
It's in no way representative
Most countries were not colonized by all sorts of different people like that at all
It's the USA that stands out in that regard, not the rest of the world "not getting it".
Its way harder to be funny
It’s tricky to convey irony
You can’t play with the words
You can’t throw out a fast remark
It’s just difficult
Well, I think I act a bit more constrained as I cannot as easily identify personality from the way of speech of foreigners as I can when talking to other Danes
Also my choice of words becomes different, less "dialect", as I use "standard" English, so my personality also is not as present when I speak English as when I speak Danish
As far as I am concerned, speaking another language fluently, is all about acting
You might pretend you are that guy from TV, and sound like him
So you have to let go of yourself and also start acting a bit differently
I feel a lot more expressive, less anxious and less Self-conscious when I'm speaking English
I've got major social anxiety whenever I'm speaking Danish
Facts
They are compensated for very unusual hours e.g. starting at 4 in the morning, so it makes sense really
København: Capital, crazy night life, shopping, worlds second oldest amusement park in the world, (the worlds oldest is Bakken, 10 min
Away from København)
Aarhus: people Call Aarhus Capital of Jylland, culture Capital 2017, one of the oldest cities in Denmark
Odense: Hans Christian Andersen
Aalborg: student city, Jomfru Ane Gade(party street), carnival, the Paris of the north
It’s probably for the best that you didn’t mention Randers
(But for real it’s not that bad
As a dane I wouldn't mind if it was disbanded, and a Scandinavian Union was formed in it's stead
Isn't Finland part of Scandinavia, or was I scammed by my elementary teacher
Damn
Nice to know
Worth noting that not all Franks switched to Vulgar Latin/Proto-French
Those living in the regions originally inhabited by the Frankish tribes kept speaking their language, which eventually developed into modern Dutch
> One theory offered is they also brought disease not native to the local population which led to a reduction in both population density and societal cohesion
That seems unlikely
There is no clear evidence of a population reduction prior to the Germanic settlement, and we can see from genetic evidence that Celtic (or more properly, 'pre-Germanic') DNA constitutes a large part of English genetic heritage
In fact, it forms a gradient, with the easternmost parts of the country around Kent and East Anglia having the most Anglo-Saxon DNA, and the west having the least
This is exactly what we would expect with a gradual settlement, where more and more people were assimilated into Saxon culture as they spread west
It does not, however, fit well with any idea of a sudden depopulation prior to, or during, the invasion
A lot of people are clearly ashamed by it, which seems rather ridiculous to me
Like a sort of cultural self-castration
Obviously it is unacceptable by today's standards, but back-projecting those standards onto the past and then condemning people for failing to live up to them is just madness
Beyond that, it is simplistic
Nearly every nation once had some sort of imperial power, or at least a local power-projection over other nations, and the ones that didn't certainly weren't being push-overs out of the goodness of their hearts
When Britain first arrived in India, much of the continent was ruled by the Mughals, and before that, by various other empires, Indian or not
Even the concept of "India" as a unified place is a colonial construct, which has only ever been close to being achieved throughout history due to imperialist conquests
None of that is to say that the British Empire was *ok*, per say, or that it was an objective good
What it was, however, was one power in a world of competing powers
The Brits just happened to be particularly good at it, and now happen to be particularly self-loathing about that fact
Put differently, a world in which the British Empire was *evil* (and I'm not saying you claim it is, but many do) is a world in which nearly every nation and people before the 20th century is evil
England too now that we're at it
Living in a quite homogeneous country with not so much diversity, it’s practically impossible to tell where somebody is from based on their names
However, if you allow me to include Sweden and Norway then there are quite a few giveaways
Sweden - using the German letters ä and ö is a clear sign that somebody is Swedish
Also when their last names ends with “son” as opposed to “sen” is also a bit of a giveaway
Norway - I love some Norwegian names because they sound like they came straight out of a fairy tale
They don’t sound foreign, but at the same time they do
Thinking of names such as Øyvind, Torgeir, Vebjørn, Gjermund
As far as i know there are no first or surnames that can tell where someone is from in Denmark
Jensen is a sure tell
Same goes for most other last names ending in Sen, as Swedish, Norwegian and English use Son
Yeah at most within the country, the last name with -gaard can tell you something about either what type of farm a person's ancestors had (Roesgaard, Melgaard, aso) what was around it (Skovgaard, Aagaard, Brønsgaard, aso), or where it was within the area they are from (Søndergaard, Nørregaard, Østergaard, aso)
But then that doesn't really tell you where the forest was, or which city they had the eastern farm in
So it's basically impossible
> Living in a quite homogeneous country with not so much diversity, it’s practically impossible to tell where somebody is from based on their names
Kofoed and Anker (last names) are super common on Bornholm
But other than that, there are hardly any regional differences in Denmark
I 1773 kom der en navnelov for Hertugdømmerne (Struenses navnelov) . I følge denne lov kunne bønderne tage faste familienavne, som skulle følge familien i al fremtid og de kunne således gå bort fra det "ægte patronykom", hvilket vil sige faderens fornavn plus -sen el
-datter
If we include Greenland, then it's easy too
Its because it's a contraction of "Anders son", "Jans son". I guess you kept the original spelling, and the Americans just contracted it to fit pronunciation, as did we
Gud ja, det er da også rigtigt
But I believe it’s a Swedish thing
In Denmark it’s still “Andersen, Jensen and Larsen” with just one s.
Haha, jamen det kan godt ske
Vi har bare ikke særligt mange af disse “eksotiske” navne her i Danmark, lol
Ah, just from what I've seen, it's usually son
Thanks for letting me know
We do
Norway writes it -sen because of Danish, and Danish does it because of how our language developed
Word-final vowels All became /e/, which is also why we have "hest**e**" instead of "häst**a**r" and "danske" instead of "svensk**a**". "Søn" is a standalone word, and so wasn't affected, but -sen is at the end of words
Yeah it's because of us
The sound-change that turned -son into -sen only happened in Danish, so it's probably a result of surnames having been introduced during the period of Danish rule
German: [Ich verstehe nur Bahnhof]
English: I only understand train station

Guys, I have a question, how do I get that flag near my name, I'm so confused
Te quiero un huevo
Que Mala pata
Pan pan y el vino vino
I knew a guy who's one sentance in Danish was
"Jeg vil gerne en dansk statsborgerskab, Jeg er liderlig" it was pretty funny
for me personally, it has to go to "Kackvogel" I don't remember where I leanred that
And also a little poem I was taught by a chinese classmate
"对不起，没关系，打个屁，臭死你“ or "Sorry, it's okay, big fart, so smelly it kills you" the guy was known for being immature, so I don't think there is any deep meaning for this
I can confirm jeg er en pølse works in danish too
I mean it is technically true
I remember "Paraste ennen" ... :)
Nice one to know
Some Belgian exchange students :)
Thank you so much
Slightly different spelling in Danish: må ikke tildækkes
Beautifully put
Reads like a poem
I feel the same about spring here in Denmark
Early spring/summer mornings is my favorite
Ahh, got you .
Most of the songs from 2002 and up
They are just boring and forgettable
A personal worst is our 2016 entry Soldiers of Love by Lighthouse X, i can't stand that song
I still think My Lovely Horse by Ted and Dougal should have been your 8th Eurovision victory
Always been a mystery to be how the UK can produce some of the best and most popular music in the world, yet still end up next to last almost every year
Most Finnish songs from before 1999, got underrated because the juries could not understand what was being sung
It's pretty sad since Finland often sends very fun and good songs
It's actually a good song, ruined by mistakes made by the Ukrainian production
(They started the Moldovian track in the middle of the song)
Okay but cliche love song was worse imo
25% of the Latvian population is Russians and speak Russian
So not completely irrational
+ The decision of how to sing the song is only up to the Television Company (Latvijas Televīzija) and the artist
Fx, in 2007, Latvia did send "Questa Notte" by Bonaparti
They were amazing
Anneke Grönloh sang "Jij bent mijn leven" at Eurovision
Not Brandend Zand
That year in 1982, the contest was held in Harrogate in the United Kingdom
Spain's song that year was an Argentinian Tango
Don't be too worried about those rules:)
Disco pogo came to Denmark in full force as well
You were good in 98'. The other years from 1997-2002, you were mediocre or trash
But they still pay taxes, to fund Latvijas Televīzija
And again, it's his and Latvijas Televīzija own choice
He could have chosen to sing it in Swahili if Latvijas Televīzija agreed to it
I think your problems with Russians as a people (russophobia), is making you hate the song, just because one version of it is in Russian
He did sing it in Latvian at Eirodziesma 2009
His vocal performance was terrible
It is only a Latvian artist singing in Russian
It is not a discussion of politics
We don't do that here in Denmark
Most of Denmark was neutral during the first world war
I say most of Denmark because southern Jutland had become part of Germany when we lost the war of 1864, so a lot of Danish men were forced to fight for the Germans
But I don't think that the people in southern Jutland wears poppies to commemorate that
The only part of Denmark that was in WW1 is Sønderjylland
I think they did have some sort of remembrance, but no longer
And they certainly don't wear a red poppy
Same
If only that had worked for WW2
Historically it absolutely is though
North Germany and Platt has had a huge influence on Denmark since the 10th century and 1864
>That makes me wonder how the whole 1864 affaire could happen in the first place, with Germans and Danish being so close lol
You never heard about the fact, that the King at the time, Christian IX secretly proposed to Bismarck, that all of Denmark would enter the German Confederation following the defeat
> By that logic, Russia, Czechia, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia, Croatia, Romania, Poland and a few other countries are also practically german
Flensburg was the second largest city in all of the Danish Realm untill 1864, and Kiel was the third largest, and Kiel had one of the only two universities
We have just as little here in Denmark
But the Danish navy “splitflag” is nice i think
Its a slightly different red than our normal flag
We've only had the one we use so
yeah
I suppose one could theoretically argue that the [Raven Banner] was a flag, and I quite like that
We don't really have a choice afaik
That should be your symbol is instead of the cross
I guess that’s why we usually score a bit higher than you in happiness
You’re just a little too blue
Danish has jalousi(noun)/jaloux(adverb) which is about personal and usual romantic feelings
Skinsyg (lit
skin sick) is an older and not widely used synonym
Then there is misundelse(noun)/misundelig(adverb) which is envy about belongings/status etc
Misundelse is probably sometimes used about romantic feelings too, idk
Jalousi and misundelse
People do use them interchangeably, but that's honestly pretty infuriating
It's a great melody for sure
Unfortunately can't use youtube at the moment for Danish content due to a dispute between the Danish music industry and google, so I can't hear this version
You Finns are funny with your tango passion by the way
Ohh fuck
lauhgs in like 10-20 different dialects/languges despite having a population of only 5
8 mil
its crazy how many dialects there are just in my city(copenhagen) there alot of dialects that makes it possible to know which part of the city they are from
I would honestly say we don’t have that many distinct dialects
Accents, sure a little bit
But the only really distinct dialects I can think of are lollandsk, Sønderjysk and bornholmsk
Perhaps some of the other smaller islands like Langeland as well
And even then they’re rarely spoken
I went to boarding school in Sønderjylland with people from all over the country including Bornholm and never had a single problem, I noticed very few pronunciation differences
And just in Copenhagen
I live in Copenhagen, what
Never noticed this at all
Oh fuck I ended up mixing dialects and accents
What about northern Jylland with Vendelbomål, strong western jutland dialects
I’ve lived in both western and eastern Jutland, and there are massive differences
Even in the eastern part where I live now, there’s quite the difference between Randers, Mols and Aarhus
That’s probably true, but it’s not even close to a country like Norway where there are like ten different words for I.
Berlin is considered the cultural capital of Europe, London the economic and Paris the fashion one
Modern Oradea is first mentioned in 1113
Cluj-Napoca is first mentioned in 1213
Danish, swedish and Norwegian = Tak (spelling may differ)
German = Danke
French = Merci
Portuguese = Obrigado
Spanish = Gracias
Italian = Grazie
Russian = Spasiba
English = Thanks
tak, takk, danke gracias, gracie pracibo, thanks
Spanish, French, Russian, English, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, German
Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Icelandic, German, English, Russian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian
Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, English, German, French, Italian, Spanish
Used to know a few more
Different spelling (takk and tak) but almost same pronunciation
You can also include Islandic and Faroese as it's the same as the other Nordic countries - except Finland, that is
I've not heard of any similar adverts in Denmark, referincing dead people
but i've seen a fair share of boobs
like this  (Pretty NSFW)
and this
But nothing's really been pulled because it was directly bad taste
(as far as i remember)
The Coldplay song "Yellow" has the line "your skin and bones" which sound like "jeg sked en bums" (I shat a pimple) in Danish
A couple of years ago I was at a Coldplay concert in Copenhagen and the entire standium basically shouted the "danish lyrics" instead of the OG
The government did make that commercial about how Danes should have more sex (eg more kids), which got a bit of criticism - though mainly abroad
Dont think many cared much either or tbh
porre in danish means means a leak (as in the plant) and my family had a game with wierd word plays when I was a kid
&#x200B;
So I think about singing a song about leaks

Come on dude flair up so we don't have to guess
quick correction, it's connecting with Lolland, not Sjælland :)
>and I’m pretty excited about it, because it’ll make going to Sweden a lot easier
We just cancelled the whole thing
Sorry, you're gonna have to figure out something else
Danish pastries are called wienerbrød (viennese bread) in Danish because of the Austrian bakers that introduced and popularized the baking techniques
Reminds me of Wienerbrød (Viennabread), only we call it that apparently, everywhere else it's a Danish
This is a fact
He's not wrong though
Lolland is part of region Sjælland and calling the regions provinces is a pretty minor mistake, so claiming that the bridge connects with region(or province) is completely true
That is correct
You can click [this link] to see how it's done
Edit: You can even Take a train all the way from Copenhagen to Hamburg
From there you can switch to a train driving to Munich which can take around 6,5 hours
It has it's own restaurant and cabins with beds
The goal of the project has always been to get Swedes travelling south quicker out of Denmark
Don't worry, you are German - nobody expected you to get a joke
Lightsaber dueling
I don't think Denmark would necessarily win it big, but it's an official sport in France and I want it to get more recognition
If I had to pick a sport that Denmark could dominate then it would probably be the ancient art of making fun of Sweden (though Norway could probably also compete there)
Beer Bowling
Awesome to play, and fun to watch for spectators as well
I thought it was revolutions
Counter strike
That is what Denmark can win
Fencing is already a sport
We need to have axe-figthing on the Olympic programme
Dane Axes specifically, for a proper Viking-fight
Save a long vertical space for leechs, in that way you can clear multiple rows at once
Welcome to grocery-tetris
In Denmark we got the [Nihilistic Peoples Party] - Which goal is to ban chucch bells on sundays, because most people got hangovers, and that everything doesn't matter, exacept cute animals
They also said that if a teenager is playing 8 hours or more of World of Warcraft, he should be allowed to miss school and get paid
The Vegan party who have compared meat-eaters to Nazis
Something like Spain or Poland
If smaller than those, I would define them as 'small'ish
I think that countries like Germany or France are big
As for Europe, the smallest country that I'd consider big (population wise) would probably be Spain, Ukraine or Poland
We’re probably the biggest Kingdom considering Greenland and Faroe Islands
Unless that title still goes to England
I don’t know what countries they still rule
We have no islands next to Antarctica, Norway has
We do have the Faroe Islands in addition to Greenland
England is not a kingdom
The UK is a kingdom
Belgium probably has more horizontal land than Norway tho
I think we have them on all trains except the metro in Copenhagen and the light rail in Aarhus
yep
although in some trains smaller trains they don't make sense, as there's no door or whatever in btween
i've also seen a quiet zones on ships
All the trains I've been on during school trips have had quiet zones, assume it's on most
Also on the longer bus routes, very common
However, in my experience of riding those with other commuters in the early morning, they are silent as the grave throughout the entire bus anyway
> they are silent as the grave
gotta focus on the smartphone
Kerteminde
Not really a good reason just nostalgia
Also it got great ice cream
Aalborg
Been there a lot
Great atmosphere, big town vibe
Aalborg
Just a very chill atmosphere, and good nightlife (before corona)
I would say Aarhus
It's about 6 hours by train away from me, but that's why I enjoy it
Me and my girl went there on our first vacation together there, and it's beautiful and cosy
Krakow was great when I was there in the summer
Less people this year, which was actually nice
Sounds interesting
Care to share
I would imagine
Imagine the culture of r/dankmemes (being overly stupid) coupled with broken, directly translated words
Now out all of that on things that only a Dane would know, and you have r/dankmark
/r/dankmark got you covered
r/okkammeratmongol
Good thing there always will be ironic good morning chat pictures to provide a meme baseline
Do you have any filters in place to make your Reddit experience a little less overwhelmingly American (or just more catered towards your personal interests)
I have about 5 variations of "9/11" added as filters since around this time of year, my feed seems to get clogged up with posts about it and it's kind of exhausting
The same goes for Halloween, a holiday I don't celebrate and find kind of obnoxious and annoying
There are a couple of terms relating to my hobbies that I filter out as they tend to go hand in hand with drama in the subreddits
People having the same fights about the same thing 3 times a month gets old, especially since the thing in question is more relevant to users in the US
Please tell me how you filter things
Filtereddit is a feature of the Reddit Enhancement Suite
Happy googling
The only annoying thing I've noticed about it is that it will mistake the word "in" for an abbreviation of inches, so if a text reads "1978 in Germany", the extension will convert that to "1978 in (5,024 cm)˜ Germany".
Oh, I forgot about 4th of July, that's going on the list
I avoid /r/all like the plague, but those themes get into so many unrelated subreddits as well: hobby subs full of "Look what I made for St
Patty's Day, guys
" or "We thought we'd do something different for Halloween this year", etc
Even benign nature subreddits are subject to things like an abundance of images of bald eagles around the 4th of July
Hence the need for keyword filters
What usually happens at that point is insane mod drama
I admit to just bringing out the popcorn and watching it all go up in flames until everything implodes
Oh, yeah, I still much prefer to have it on than not, it just throws me off a sentence sometimes
A lot less than having to read everything in imperial, though
Sex education in week 6 (sex and the number six is pronounced the same in Denmark) all up until 8th/9th grade
It was decent
Week 6 is national sex ed week, so children have sex Ed during that week all through school (0-9 grade) until high school
In high school a organization called the sexualisterne visit and give lectures
I lended a book in the library
Also the school did quite I bit
We don’t get any
only had it once in grade 6 or 7 i think, but yeah week 6
The Indian yogis who developed modern yoga or the kind of yoga most people think of with all the focus on stretching and bending took inspiration from Danish/Swedish gymnastics
Many of these moves are to be found in the book “Grundgymnastik eller primitiv gymnastik" by gymnast Niels Ebbesen Mortensen Bukh
In original yoga a posture(or asana) simply means to sit, a seated posture which is a meditative position with legs folded
Not downward dog or warrior pose or any of the hundreds of other poses
In the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, asanas (postures) are mentioned only around 3 times
The point of yoga is spiritual transformation not exercise
The 5000 year old breathing and meditation techniques are inceedibly powerful
No need for gymnastics - hence why they dont appear until 100 years ago
Yeah that really struck me when visited many years ago why there were so many Vietnamese given exactly what you mentioned
But totally makes sense given communism
No no, it is very serious
Maybe we could tell them that Sweden has lots of oil but lacks freedom and democracy
My father is American, my mother is Danish
I identify completely as Danish - I've never lived in the US, I don't feel at home in their culture, and though I speak English completely fluently, my accent isn't even particularly American-sounding
Ofc
having a parent from the US has affected my worldview, but in terms of identity, it really doesn't matter
I imagine it's actually more complicated when your parent is from a neighbouring country
Then you could realistically feel split
The US, however, is just too distant to be a tangible presence in my life
I am half Danish and half Faroese and I identify as both because I am proud that the am Danish and it is not every day people meet someone Faroese
Our fellow Nordic brethren are always welcome here in Denmark
I hope you like it here
In 1933 the Danish State minister Thorvald Stauning invited his political competitors and colleges, to his home, to negotiate plans to solve the financial crisis, after many ours of failed negotiations, the politicians where about to leave but Stauning invited them to stay for a glass of whiskey, and they manage to find a solution and the liberal partys agreed not stand in the way of the socialistic methods
The negotiations of Kanslergade is a canon-point in Danish history
I would say the English Wars and the Bombardment of Copenhagen in 1807
During the Napoleonic Wars, Denmark attempted to remain Neutral but the Great Powers of Europe had other ideas and the British invaded Denmark in an attempt to seize the Danish fleet
They succeeded after bombing the capital, after which Denmark surrendered the fleet
This removed the dominance of the Danish fleet in the Baltic - the Danish claim to fame - and it forced Denmark to choose a side in the Napoleonic Wars
When Denmark decided to spare the Germans in WW2
They were conquered twice just prior to this by Danish kings anyway, and that didn't last overly long
Norway was in an even worse position to hold onto it, so the presumption that it would've had any lasting impact is one hell of an assumption
Made me think of when I was young and on vacation in France
My dad would order "café espresso" and I was embarrassed, because I thought he was telling the waiter to hurry up
In Demark foreigners are apparently taught to say "goddag, hvordan har du det
" because that's what they all say and it sounds so strange
Noone else would say that here
Knock, knock
"Who's there
"To
"To, who
"It's *to whom*."
My uncle used to do it too
You say foreigners but in Danish it's also Beograd
Tolkien's Elvish was partially inspired on a sound-level by Welsh, but Elvish in the Witcher is literally just slightly garbled Welsh
The Elves call Geralt "Gwynbleidd", and *gwyn* is Welsh for "white", while *bleidd* is Welsh for "wolf". The Elven forest of Brokilon is clearly named after Brocéliande, which is a forest in the Arthurian mythos, Arthur being originally Welsh
I don't even understand what he's saying
Finnish city names are
Finnish
And that's bad
That just sounds like the typical "my culture is bland because I'm used to it", which pretty much everyone has to some extent
To me, Finnish sounds super exotic and interesting - as does, say Mandarin, yet of course to a native Mandarin speaker, there is nothing particularly fantastical about Xinjiang or Guangyuan
We just mix it up and pronounce it with a soft d instead
In a small country as Denmark, the middle of nowhere still exists
It would probably be most of northern Jutland, as soon as you get north of Aalborg and until Frederikshavn, you are literally in the middle of fucking nowhere
The coasts are nice tho
> I'd say that despite not being "in the middle" of anything
I'd say Danes typically operate with two different meanings of "middle of nowhere". Most of the time it really means "far from anything of note", and you could be surrounded by farms and it'd still be called *midden af ingenting*. That said, there are some places which are truly desolate
The area between Vrads and Christianshede is very, very empty
One of the few places where air-photos will show trees out to the horizon
I'd say that central Jutland south-west of Silkeborg is actually the most desolate-feeling region
That said, the military areas of Oxbøl are the only places I've wandered where you can go for miles and miles with genuinely *nothing*, just rain and moor and occasionally fake prop-buildings
As for Lolland, it has a different sort of feel to me
I think it's because it's *so* tilled and farmed and so densely settled that even though it is certainly "far from anywhere of note" it still looks totally tame
To put it this way: I can picture wolves throughout Jutland (in fact, I've seen one), but I cannot picture them on Lolland
Jutland is a mosaic of farmland, heaths, forests and small towns
Lolland is really all one big crop-field, often to the horizon
Large parts of Lolland don't even have species common in other parts of Denmark (like foxes and squirrels) because there is so little room for nature, even of the generalist sort
Dane here
I have noticed that child families move out of the city (Copenhagen) or to the outskirts of the city
When then kids get older they move to the big city to study, party etc
Nature here is boring, no dangerous animals, natural phenomenon or geography
The only sign ive seen that me slightly nervous was when driving next to a military area where artillery and tanks train
"what if they miss and shoot too far" briefly entered my mind
> Have you noticed the blood red stream
Do not worry, it happens from time to time
It's a natural occurrence"
Hol up
It’s not very big in Denmark/Sweden, which is a shame because it’s so much fun to play, and not as dangerous as many people think
And it’s way more fun to watch and play than football
Would love to play but there’s just no clubs around my home, which sucks
It's not really popular, which is funny, because Denmark's sports scene is quite wide, with lots of different sports getting a good amount of attention
The most popular being football and handball
Some other sports are beginning to rise quick, such as basketball
But not rugby
Of course
Personal experience is that I find cold eggs easier to handle when it comes to Danish meatballs etc, I don't know why
And warm milk fucking sucks
that depends on how the eggs are manufactured/treated in the packaging factory, some eggs are left "natural" they are less likely ro go bad outside the fridge, while those that are treated should be kept in the fridge
Eggs in Denmark are refrigerated, and we're part of the EU
And it seems a lot of your fellow Swedes in this comments section put them in the fridge as well
Where is this invisible divide
It seems from this thread to be a general North-South divide, with a northwestern crescent of fresh-milk drinking countries (from the Baltics through Scandinavia to Ireland) while Germany can go both ways, with the south beyond tending towards UHT
It occurs to me that I have mostly avoided drinking milk altogether while in the south, which, in hindsight, was perhaps rather fortunate
Pretty sure it's the same here
Forgot
Yea, that's what i'm talking about as well, the eggs are refrigerated in the stores as well
I don't know about the moisture of the eggs, cus i've never checked upon coming home, but buns that i buy are always damp when i come home
It says on the eggs from my local grocery store that they shouldn't be kept at anything above 12C, so that's why they put them in the fridge
In Denmark I have never been offered a doggybag, except at one Thai restaurant
A shame really, since the food will just be wasted
Here in Denmark, it's just not really a thing you do
They do not offer it as something you can do as you get ready to leave
You can ask, and I don't think it'd be frowned upon
But it is not a common thing
I honnestly think most people don't even realize you could do it
I wouldn't say it's frowned upon - personally I doubt I would do it
I always eat up, unless I really dislike the food
I remember once my dad "ordered" froglegs from a semi expensive restaurant that didn't take orders because it was his birthday, that was hilarious
With that being said I mostly eat in restaurants when I'm on vacation
I used both ANSI and ISO-DK
I can switch back and forth pretty easy
ANSI is preferred because it's better for programming and in general symbols are easy to type (imo)
I also made my own layout called [DWERTY] which is ANSI layout with "shortcuts" to Danish keys
Based off of [SWERTY]
Edit: Should point out OP that QWERTY and QWERTZ aren't the preferred way to tell keyboard layouts apart
[ ISO and ANSI are] ISO layouts have the vertical enter (ISO enter) and one more key than ANSI
ANSI is more or less US English layout, the Dutch Keyboard layout is also based off of this no ISO
It has a horizontal enter
ISO has variations for each local, Like ISO-DE, ISO-ES, etc
QWERTY with Å added after P and Æ,Ø added after L

<ZXCVBNM,.-
The Nordics have a shared keyboard layout, which is basically the same as English, but with "Å" "Ö/Ø" and "Ä/Æ" to the right of the "P" and "L". Since the layout is the same in all of the Nordics, and Swedish is the most used language in the Nordics, the Swedish letters are the biggest and the ones that are the same size as the other "regular" letters, with the Danish/Norwegian versions being smaller underneath the Swedish ones
At least this is the case on all the keyboards I've owned
[Example here]
I have several
One uses qwerty with a Danish layout, and another uses qwerty with a UK layout
I have also on occasion used a qwerty with another layout that was neither of the previous ones, but which I can't remember
Also Danish but with Æ Ø instead
That's really odd, because even on Danish keyboards you can make È without any trouble
For us it's pressing the [accent key] and then Shift + E.
You can also switch layout with win+space
I don't have the euro-sign on my 5-key on my keyboards
The euro-sign is only on alt-gr+e.
Thanks for making the post, I like keyboards :)
It always confuses the hell out of me, since we have both the Danish and Norwegian layout printed, and I can never remember which is which
I've recently had it pointed out by a New Zealander living in Denmark that this is something to do as well - after some consideration I realized the only times I ever touch my curtains, is if the sun bothers me
Tbh, when thinking about it, I realized it's simply because I don't care - if somebody looks into my apartment and sees me naked, what going to happen
At best they're going to see my boobs and not care about it, at worst they are going to see my boobs and get offended/excited by it
Either way, it doesn't affect me - after all, they are the ones peeking into other peoples houses, why should I care
Agreed, I also don't think that people look through windows in Denmark, it's kinda against our unwritten rules
We like our privacy
That's true - don't think I've ever caught people looking, nor ever looked myself
God it must be tough being young in Sweden
I resonate with this so much - though alcohol is certainly cheaper and more easy to acquire in Denmark than in Sweden, sharing at parties is a grey zone because it easily brings on the situation of who-gives-what and who-takes-what, that you mentioned
Certainly, Danes will always share their alcohol with you if you ask - some might even offer - but it'd be considered a big faux pas to take without asking or without having something to share of your own as well
We will accept it for a while if you don't, but if it's a clear pattern that you don't bring your own alcohol, Danes will start turning cold towards you (though likely not confront you directly, as that would be considered equally rude, instead you'd just be banned from the alcohol or the parties)
(There also a hieraki of which alcohols we do share - beers are seen as personal items only to be shared in dire situations, whereas mixers and spirits are often shared if asked)
I’ve caught people in a few instances, but they’re instantly embarassed
as they should be ;) must have been awkward for everybody, though
By now I live on the tenth floor so for me its neither here nor there, but growing up in a house in Jylland with my bedroom-window facing the street, I can imagine several people over the years have glanced at the house and looked into my room
Never caught anybody at it though
Yes and no - I'm 27 years old and most of my social group is late 20s to early 30s, and we still do the BYOB unless it's like a dinner party (and then we'll do what non-Scandinavians apparently do at regular parties, where everybody/most will bring at least something like a bottle of wine as a host-gift, which will then be used to drink at the dinner)
My parents don't really hold the "drinking-parties" anymore, but the few instances they have (meaning a party where it wasn't a formal, aka
invite in the mail and plan weeks ahead, kinda thing),  people would often drink a couple of beers ect
for themselves
I'd imagine it's exactly because it's cheap that beer and cider is personal - everybody should be able to afford it, plus its stable in any Danes diet  spirits, however, are an indulgence which not everyone can afford and are therefore more likely to be shared
Plus people have strong preferences in which beers they like, so it can't just be changed between people
Amongst friends money should never be an issue - but parties rarely involve only your friends, which is why the situation is as it is
With my friends I have a clear "I get this round, you get the next and if not - then surely its fine anyways
", however at a private party there'll be people who aren't my friends, either strangers or simply acquaintances
If these people were to ask me to have some of my alcohol at a party, likely I'd say yes because I'm there to be merry and make friends, but I'm not about to offer it up myself, because it's not my jobs to supply the whole party with drinks - everyone supplies for themselves, and then, if you want variety, you can share amongst you as you might wish
My friends would know they can just grab some of mine, as well as I know I can grab some of theirs - everybody else
They have to ask, it's simple
>A regular bottle of Beefeater 700ml will set you back 25 EUR
I can get one on sale in my local Føtex for 15 euro right now
>Bring it, but just expect others to also enjoy that gin
That would be really annoying
> In fact, people will often ask people to try their nice drink, so that they too can enjoy it
This, I can relate to
I like sharing and tasting someone else's nice drinks
I don't like to be the only one bringing a quality bottle and everyone would enjoy it, and than next time still bring cheap beers and drinks expecting me to bring another quality bottle
I have actually tried that
If it's expected anyone just can help themselves to your booze, than you just end up with a party, where everyone only bring cheap drinks and where's the fun in that (unless you are a teenager)
The fact that 2,8% beer exists in the first place is a crime against humanity
Is it treated as water by employers, in that it can be consumed in the workplace
Aha I wouldn't bat an eye to a construction worker drinking a regular beer
It is pretty cool tho, but I doubt it even has an effect when it only contains 0,4-0,5 units
We actually have a Christmas tradition of giving similarly alcoholic beers, mixed with lemon soda, to children, where I'm from
The most recent thing I can think of would be when king Christian X caused the Easter Crises by dismissing the government in 1920 without approval of parliament, in an effort to get approval for his plan regarding the reunification with Schleswig
Ironically this event was also what cost the Danish Monarchy the last bit of real political power that they had
All for the greater good
Can’t make an omelette without cracking a few Irish
Hah no, not at all
Its not atractive to be so white you might as well be transparent
Theres a reason we have different skincolors
Our skin has adjusted to the amount of sun we are exposed to
No color is unhealthy
I thought 70% humidity was normal
It's always between 50-100% here in Denmark
We have 92% humidity in my city right now
Which Saxony are we talking
I presume the one in eastern Germany
I think it’s seen as slightly weird here in the Nordics because it’s so expensive to eat at restaurants
The people I know that eat at restaurants the most use them maybe, maaaybe twice or thrice a month
In many other countries it seems like three times a week is not uncommon
Someone booking a three month trip to South America all alone is similarly seen as slightly weird by many
a lot of people who live alone, eat alone at home all the fucking time
why would it be weird to do so, in a restaurant ?
I think another reason it might be seen as slightly weird here in the Nordics is that it’s so expensive to eat at restaurants
The people I know that eat at restaurants the most use them maybe, maaaybe twice or thrice a month
In many other countries it seems like three times a week is not uncommon
Yeah, not happening here, unless you’re a millionaire
Same in Denmark, except it would maybe be a couple of Euros cheaper, but only a couple
I also said the people I know that use restaurants the absolute most - there’s a wide range before that
Only going to restaurants a couple of times *a year*  is not uncommon
Personally, I eat out maybe once every other month (excluding McDonald’s and such) and I think that’s pretty standard
No bail and no bounty - the government shouldn't potentially make money of their citizens being arrested, for very logical reasons
Nope
we do have rewards for turning in information, to the police, that can lead to the arrest of a few certain people in some situations, but it's rare
Same here in Denmark
But it's not like the rest of the world have big issues with people not showing up for court - I imagine the percentages are about the same tbh, no matter if you have bail or not
The "surety" is unnecessary if you have a court system and law enforcement system that functions the way it should
Depends on what you did
People who are considered a danger to society will be detained, others will be let go
If they are let go the judge, if needed, can make the call that police will pick them up on the day they are to appear in court
If not, they are simply expected to appear on your own
If you don't then you can be fined, and you are more likely to lose your court case, as you aren't present to defend yourself
I've seen news stories from the US where people pay several tens of thousands in bail
Are you telling me that's all administration and none of that but a small amount is left
Yes indeed, Danish ærtesuppe (like your erwtesoup) is amazing
Funny how we use so many similar words
More accurately, you promote the growth of lactic acid bacteria, that make the brine sour
This in turn protects against other bacteria, since they can't live in acid and salt solutions
Basically every country, where it was needed to preserve vegetables through winter does it

My entire family is atheist, but every time we went on any kind of vacation, we always went to a bunch of churches and temples
There's just something about it - like a calm and beauty that's hard to find elsewhere
They have covered every angle with the location:
UNESCO World Heritage Site, Ilulissat, Jakobshavn, Greenland, Denmark
I know
I have visited 9/10, of them
Thats pretty impressive :)
Sadly I am at 4, maybe 5 (if a quick childhood visit at Christiansfeld counts - basically I only remember the honeycake)
What food-related discussion is your country having
Like the French chocolatine vs pain au chocolate
In Denmark, koldskål is a yoghurt-thingy that’s popular to eat in the summer
You eat it with small biscuits called kammerjunker in
There are many [memes] about the best brand of koldskål, as well as whether you crush your kammerjunker or leave them in whole
Pork roast vs duck on Christmas is also big, although many do both
As well as chocolate buns vs [raisin buns]
Is the raisin vs chocolate buns really a debate
I cant think of a single instance where that was the topic of a discussion
You crush the kammerjunker
What kind of monster would eat them hole
Hummus with bare hands
Do we make the hummus wrong, because our hummus is way too thin to be eaten with bare hands
I’ve heard it quite a bit, although the others are bigger and the kammerjunker one seems to be the biggest
Raisin lovers get shamed big time (as they should)
I eat them whole as a side
Always found it so weird how most people dump them in the koldskål
I fucking love snails
They’re great
In the Camaque area I had them where you were supposed to dip them in chili mayo
Damn that's really intersting actually
I can't imagine that's the origin of the terrorist group Taliban
I am sorry what

Danmark, the Danish name
It just fits better with the demonym "Dane".
Lego Land:OG edition
I want to change the name in Danish because if we say North Poland it means the North Pole which is confusing
I love the name Amelia, but I’m afraid it would be pronounced odd in my language
(Amalie is a very common name)
I really like the Spanish girls name “Dulcinea” which i first met in the book “Don Quixote”.
But i don’t actually think it’s a common name anywhere in general
Beautiful Chairs as well
With a name like that you can’t not be a Wizard
>Also, while we're at it, while googling for cool names we found Ganja on the list of popular scandinavian names
Wtf
Does anyone know someone called ganja
No, ganja means cannabis here
it's strange, because Sasha is by far mostly a girls name in Denmark
or Dick from Richard
He's lying lol
The polo logo is like synonymous with dads or posh young people

The only time i personally wear clothes with logos on is when i exercise
Otherwise never
Clothes with logos on is a big fashion no no in my book
Its ugly, its tacky and theres no need to advertise for a brand that tou paid so much money for
Same in Denmark, but just with Peak Performance jackets
I can't find any proof of Denmark relying heavily on German electricity, besides during the summer of 2018 where all the nordics had a shortage of electricity and had to import from elsewhere in europe
Far as I can tell we typically export wind energy to Germany as often as we import energy from them and generally rely more on importing energy from norway and Sweden when there's a lack of wind
Do you have any sources I could see
Because if that's the case, I would want to know
Until I learned differently I thought Athens was all the best parts of Rome (the old ones) just Greek instead
Controversial opinion, but it's a shame nuclear power has gotten such a bad rep
It's not what I want us to rely on forever, but using coal instead can't possibly be viewed as an improvement
The exchange of energy between the Nordic countries and with Germany is complicated stuff in general though, while looking up statistics I saw that during today alone Denmark has both imported from and exported energy to Germany
It switches back and forth all the time and is different for different parts of the country as energy generation and consumption fluctuates
In general our power grids are a lot more connected than I'd realized
I agree with everything, except the 'subtle' bit
It may come off as subtle to other Swedes, but dear Christ
It is *not* subtle
My guess is he was either a prick or from Sjælland
Jutland people are usually extremely humble, laid-back and self-deprecating people
*Usually
* But yeah, a lot of Scandinavian people are way too up their own asses about their countries
I frequently mention the Netherlands as a way more friendly place when people point out how friendly everyone in Scandinavian countries are, ironically, lol
It could be someone from Copenhagen
Southern and mid - Sjællændere are more reserved in my experience, though Jutes are very nice people
Scandinavia use "son/søn/sen" which just means "son of"
I'll find it quite saddening how many of the Scandinavian people will switch to english when speaking to people from other countries, we can understand 99% of what other Scandinavians say, it's just easier to speak English
I’m annoyed that a simple constructed language isn’t used instead, so nobody would have that native speaker advantage
I like being multilingual
I just hate that I switch between American and British English
Actually can’t wait for the Germans broadly to become kinda good at it
That will hopefully result in the German language being less of a necessity to learn in the eyes of the schools and ministry
(Can’t say most of us enjoy having to be taught 2 additional languages)
Yeah I think it’s a Scandinavia thing
Scandinavian languages are quite close to English actually
No, that's what makes danish such a powerful language, it is a language, impossible to learn for foreigners, making only those worthy of it able to speak the language
This
Almost everybody loved English, because everybody found it easy and sometimes you watched cool movies, while German/French was everyone’s hate subject
Didn't understand a single word but agreed
Germany
Whaaaaat, noooo
We'll do it again ;)
When the Øresund freezes we are gonna come
just after we are done getting ourselves stupidly drunk
So give it back
You’ve had it long enough
We'll welcome you back into the kingdom with open arms, although we might get a small problem doing the same Halland and Blekinge
Well if so
be ready to party like its 1520 ;)
I get why
Danish isn't easy to learn
Speaking depends on what area you are in or who you speak to
And then there's one dialect
I won't bother trying
Good thing though, most can speak english, so shouldn't be a nightmare to visit
Hope it does
You're both right
It's a matter of semantics
The German dialects are considered dialects of one language because of politics
It's the same reason but opposite case of why Croatian and Serbian or Hindi and Urdu are *not* considered the same language
In the latter case, they are basically identical, sometimes hardly even dialectally distinguished, but considered separate because their speakers won't deign to be conflated with each other
In German's case, all the dialects are considered one language despite often not even being mutually intelligible, for the sake of enforcing the narrative of German unity
Danish, Norwegian and Swedish are at least as similar to each other as many German dialects, yet are considered different languages
In another timeline, one with a single country called Scandinavia, they would all be considered dialects of Scandinavian
You are talking about the state of Saxony
Standard German is an mixture of Alemannic (or High German) dialects
Saxon is one such dialect, but that is because the present-day state of Saxony (after which the Saxon dialect is named) has taken its name from Old Saxony (now Niedersachsen)
German terminology is confusing on countless levels, but for simplicity, Low German = (Low) Saxon (of Anglo-**Saxon** fame) = Ingvaeonic
These are the people Charlemagne was mean to
Old Saxony ≠ Modern Saxony/Sachsen and the dialect of modern Saxony (Upper Saxon) ≠ true Saxon
Having written it out, that doesn't look simple at all
Low German is an entirely different language than all dialects of High German, which didn't influence Standard German and which is more closely related to English and Frisian
Somewhere along the line, you have misunderstood something
I'm trying to figure out where
OP said
> It actually is its own language
It developed from Saxon which is Ingvaeonic/North Sea Germanic unlike German which comes from Irmionic/Elbe Germanic
He was *explicitly* referring to the North-Sea Saxons, the Ingaevones, that is, the Low Saxons
The Electorate of Saxony has nothing to do with them, expect the name, and the modern-day state (and dialect, Upper Saxon) are located in, and descend from, *that* Saxony, not the one OP was referring to
Kursachsen is the direct predecessor of the state of Saxony, and you need only [skim the Wikipedia article] to confirm as much
Looking at a map would achieve much the same
You were responding to OP, who was talking about Low German, which is what this entire conversation was about
u/Bl0odwork_ said he spoke Low German, u/ninjaiffyuh elaborated that Low German was actually its own language, descended from Saxon, and thus unrelated to Standard German, which is High German
Then *you* stepped in, claiming that Saxon was actually related to Standard German, by saying, and I quote:
> Maybe down a very long road, but High German today is an artificial mix that evolved in **Saxony** and the merchant cities of south Germany
Now that is true, except *that* Saxony is the Electorate of Saxony, which is not what OP was talking about
Nobody spoke Low German in Kursachsen, so either you conflated Low Saxony and Kursachsen, or you randomly brought up a different part of the country with no relevance to the conversation whatsover
Which was it
As for that guff about "true" Saxony, I was quite transparently referring to the place the [Saxons] actually came from - that is, Low Saxony
All the other Saxonies are named *after* that Saxony, so if "the original Saxony" would have pleased you more, then let's go with that
But the conversation wasn't about High German
Everybody else has expressed confusion at your posts
But no, it's the children who are wrong
What’s your country’s hard-to-swallow pill
Scandinavians and Dutchmen like to feel clever and on a high horse because of our high English proficiency, however we conveniently forget that we’re literally the languages that are closest related to English *in the world*.
I recently looked a bit on Korean grammar and there’s nothing intuitive about it
At all
It’s an entirely different way of thinking while speaking
Meanwhile I could guesstimate a lot in English
I imagine a lot of Europeans can’t, because English is so different from their native language
Secondly, “the Nordic welfare model” is kinda overblown
Lots of countries have free healthcare and 30 days vacation and paid university, they’re not all Nordic
I feel this one
Towards who
Spanish and Italian are very big languages
Dutch is also somewhat big but the Scandinavian languages has 6 million, 4 million and 10 million speakers respectively
I like how the rest of Scandinavia refers to this as “the Nordic/Scandinavian model”, while Sweden refers to this as “the Swedish model”
I was genuinely shocked when I learnt that the US has a higher GDP per capita than us
Yet we have free university, healthcare, and just generally higher standards of living for the general populace
Not at all hating on the US in general, but your system needs a serious overhaul
Some of us find that accent endearing and even quite sexy
Norway exporting hydro-power means that other countries can decarbonize their electricity generation
So overall it's better for the climate
You should do it even more, as Norwegian hydro is the only inexpensive way to deliver flexible, cheap, and low-carbon electricity
who cares about poles anyway tbh
Ah, you sort of just pretend to be
Obviously, it depends on the person's voice, manner of speaking, etc
, as it would with any accent, but yes, German accents can definitely be endearing or sexy
Sure, it's not going to decarbonize Europe as such
But with the expansion of wind-energy in the North Sea, Norway is going to export more hydro and import more wind
no one really
Not to be rude but what's the relevance
It might geographically be further away, but we speak the language and are familiar with the culture(s), so I'd not say that California is far and exotic, no
But it isn't two words in Swedish
It is, its "Medeltiden" meaning the middle time or the middle age
the Scandinavian languages all compound words are always written without space in between
That's why you can basically make infinitively long words in our languages
For example, the longest word recorded in public records in danish is "speciallægepraksisplanlægningsstabiliseringsperiode" meaning (roughly) specialist doctor practice planning stabilisation periode
But said in, and considered, a single word
Finland doesn't count as a Scandinavian country
At least in Scandinavia it doesn't.
I don't know anything about the Finnish language though
Its quite far removed from any of the Scandinavian languages
You'll have to ask a Finn about that :)
Nordic, yes
Scandinavian, no
Well they're currently making Assassins Creed: Valhalla
That was the one a lot of my friends wanted since the beginning
I've never been a big fan though, they seem awfully buggy
Don’t mix Danish viking history with Norwegian
Such a bummer that we can’t go to Denmark, yet the vikings in england were danish
Well, they're doing Valhalla now
So that's my country
Maybe it would be interesting to see a game set during The Great Northern War which was basically Sweden vs
Russia, Denmark and Poland-Lithuania
They kinda are, and I would've chosen exactly the period, so I'm happy
Yes
And fun fact, in Denmark we currently have a late night show who does a televisef christmas show with a new episode each day (traditionally called a televised christmas calendar)
Each day they drink a new christmas beer, but since the entirety of the show is recorded within 6 hours they just become more and more drunk with each episode
It’s the 2nd time they’re doing it, but I see it becoming a tradition to watch for adults
Huh, same thing here, in regards to Die Hard
Randers Boys, if you see a scooter speeding down the highway and they're drinking Mokai, they're probably from Randers
Bumser
People from Tønder
We have something called Jyder
Jyder
I heard chungos as well
Don't know if that's catalan though
Yeah or Brians
Brăila*
And Amagermanden
I can smell an københavner or fynbo
Oj, skal vi slås?
Sjælland is at least as Brian as our worst areas
or those from Vestegnen
We had a kind of folk rock but that scene is still very popular today
Danish popular music was also very much inspired by British and American music at the time
No doubt the most popular band in the period was [Gasolin]
In the 70's you had a lot of music inspired by Bob Dylan, jimi Hendrix and the hippie movement as well as more mainstream rock
[Sebastian] [Skousen & Ingemann] were heavily inspired by American rock and folk for instance
Parallel to this, there was a strong schlager tradition from the 70s up until today which in Danish is called Dansktop music
Artists like Birthe Kjær, Johnny Reimer and Peter Belli
In the 80s there were more pop music, and artists like [Lis Sørensen] [Anne Linnet] and the pop bands [Gnags] and [TV2] were very popular
The general trends in American and British music, like disco, reaggae, new wave etc also influenced Danish music
This is so completely random
I read this comment, and then all of a sudden the guy on the radio [presented this new band] who are inspired by Anatolian psych rock
What are the odds
In the 80's there were also bands like, TV2, Kliche and Gnags
Well there is Gasolin who every dane loves, there is shubidua and there's Kim Larsens solo project
those were the most popular from that time that people still love today:)
EDIT: the song det bedste til mig og mine venner is my favorite from Gasolin
death machine definetely has a darker Sound than the bands i've mentioned
But to me, they Do have a bit of a similar feel
I can understand Norwegian
But Swedish to me is Russian
I can have a pretty decent conversation with a Norwegian guy, and also a basic conversation with a Swedish guy
German
I suck at german️
I'm a french and have been living in damnmark for 5 years now
Once I correctly read a few sentences in Swedish without realising it, so that's enough to convince me that the languages are really similar
> "Hyggjeleg" also sounds like the Icelandic word "Huggulegt", which means "cozy".
[*Danish influence intensifies*]
It isn't thing anymore but we had something called "radbrækning" you get whipped for 9 weeks, after that you get every bone broken either starting from the neck and down or from your toes and up
When that's done you would be weaved into a wooden wheel, put on a stick and left for the birds to eat you
We make our victims step on LEGO
We have a whole island called "amager" which is where people where taken to be executed by decapitation - it's now a part of Copenhagen
some people still use the term "amager halshug" (Amager decapitation) which is a way of saying "i swear, i'm telling the truth"
I honestly have no idea what the Danish way of killing would be
If someone knows please comment below mine, I am interested to know
Don't forget there where the whole burning people alive because they might be witches
If you learn a second language, part of learning that language means learning their culture and history - f.ex
when learning German we have history in German class where we are taught German history in the German language
The same is (should be) done in all other foreign languages in the Danish school system
But that's the closes you get to it
We have English from the second year (this is a newer thing, I first had it as a subject in the fourth year) and German from the sixth, but we get German so late that most people (me included) never really catch on
Danish is of course the main language
Then we learn english and either french or german
And that is standard and mandatory
And thats from you're like 13
Det skulle du helst have haft hvert år gennem hele folkeskolen :)
Ja, jeg skrev en opgave under min kandidat om inddragelsen af svensk og norsk i danske folkeskoler og gymnasier og det er meget almindeligt enten aldrig at have haft det eller kun et par gange eller en enkelt gang i folkeskolen
Men rent officielt skal vi have det hver år vi har dansk gennem hele folkeskolen, plus i gymnasiet hvis man læser på STX eller HF
Desværre overholdes det slet ikke - det er det samme i Norge og Sverige
Gennem vores Skandinavisk samarbejdpolitik skal vi alle undervises i hinandens sprog, men ingen af os bliver det rigtigt - det er en af grundene til vi har meget sværere ved at forstå hinanden nu end f.eks
vores forældre og bedsteforældre havde
Aint that the truth
Det var også det vi kom frem til i vores opgave da vi talte med undervisere
I folkeskolen er det mere fordi underviserne ikke mener det er nødvendigt/interessant og selv føler det er noget de ikke kan finde ud af
Haha nej, det behøver du i hvert fald ikke ;)
Altså nu er min far skolelærer (dog i specialklasse, men alment uddannet som dansk og historie lærer - de samme to fag jeg selv læste på uni sjovt nok) og han var i hvert fald 100% dygtigere til dansk end jeg var i 3
g og hele vejen gennem både min bachelor og kandidat kunne jeg bruge ham som støtte i begge fag
De har jo også haft STX eller tilsvarende, plus flere år med fagene intensivt på seminarium
Men, alligevel tror jeg nu det kommer meget an på underviseren når det kommer til stykket
Greenland and the Faroe Islands like to say they work towards independence
But that is to avoid the EU
I don't think there are, unless you count Greenland as being part of Denmark
Sort of
There are active independence movements in both Greenland and the Faroes, especially Greenland
On the one hand, they have a lot of political momentum behind them
On the other hand, it is completely economically unfeasible, and I'm not sure the Danish government would even accept a sudden unilateral declaration
So are they close
Well, I can quite easily imagine a scenario in which the Greenlandic government succeeds in running a populist campaign for independence, then promptly collapses the economy
It'd be stupid as hell, but it could well happen
We have Greenland and the Faroe Islands
I don’t know how severe it is tho
Greenland is mostly self governing, except for Denmark providing a direct yearly subsidy equal to roughly 25% of their gdp
How is Cornwall different
They are not in the EU
The reason they are not independent is more for economic reasons
Couldn't hunting and wild life laws not just be managed by the individual län?
This Frenchman speaks the truth
>They are not in the EU
That was basically the first thing they decided and one of the main things behind the wish to have self-government
A Danish viking, [Rorik] did rule over parts of Friesland in the 9th century
"Boyfriend" and "girlfriend" are both *kæreste* (dearest)
"Tax" and "treasure" are both *skat*. It's also used as a term of endearment
"Poison" and "married" are both *gift*.
Gender: køn
Cute: køn
Nice: køn
Edit: Convent and monestery are Kloster in Danish
"Pigeon" and "dove" are both called "due". To this day, I don't actually know what the difference between a pigeon and a dove is (i.e. why is it a turtle dove and not a turtle pigeon, and why is it a crowned pigeon and not a crowned dove)
A newt and a salamander are also both just called "salamander" in Danish
Several animals:
Abe: ape and monkey
Pindsvin: porcupine and hedgehog
Blæksprutte: octopus and squid
&#x200B;
I was watching an animal show the other day with my girlfriend and it was the first time it ever occurred to her that a squid and an octopus were too different things in English
Can't think of any rn, but there are lots the other way around
Both Submarine and U-Boat are just Ubåd.
Boyfriend and girlfriend is both kæreste
So in reality, you could have a kurkku in your kurkku
Same in Danish, I love it
I love how kæreste is just so simple
In most languages I’ve come across it has some awkward double meaning that can be misunderstood, like how in English a girlfriend can be a female friend, and in German a friend and a girlfriend is both Freundin etc
Yeah, it's a bit unfortunate
But because one's a noun and one's a verb, you can always tell which one is being used due to the sentence structure
*Skat* (tax) and *skat* (treasure) are both nouns, so they're much more interchangeable and good for puns
With *gift* you might have to do some grammatical finagling to get a pun to work
Yeah, it's definitely unambiguous as far as the status of the relationship is concerned
The gender neutral aspect is quite fun, too
Now I have an image in my head of some guy called Scott handing in his tax-free forms at the airport to get the VAT refunded on his Royal Copenhagen souvenir plate .
But that's super interesting
I always love learning about new etymological links, so thanks for sharing
Yeah
A cloister is a korsgang (cross hallway) in Danish  and korsgång in Swedish :)
The rats with wings that live in cities and shit on sculptures are pigeons indeed (feral domestic pigeons which are descended from rock pigeons if we have to get technical), but there are hundreds of other species like the ones I mentioned, and I can't make sense of why some are "doves" and some are "pigeons". Turtle doves aren't white for example
Not exactly
A U-boat is a boat that sails above water but has the ability to dive
A submarine is a boat that sails under water
Almost nothing i care about, is covered in Danish
Sure, there's a tiny bit
but it's SO much easier to find gaming related websites (for example) in English
only danish sites i visit are computer related or related to regular news
On places like youtube, i dont follow any danish channels
It has always been like that for me
My games, my TV shows and movies are for the most part, english, and i've been a gamer since the late 80s.
I've even chosen to install english language on my computers windows, just because it's easier to solve problems and follow a little step by step guide etc, without having to translate as i go
I believe it's like this for most other people around my age (i'm in my mid 30s)
also, i've been taught english in school since 4th grade and more and more english is being springled into our language
We don't dub
English lessons start around 7
We get almost all of our entertainment from English speaking countries
English is a Germanic language, such as our own
The vikings affected the Ebglish language greatly, many English words come directly from the vikings
Compared to Germany we hardly translate or dub anything really
I wholeheartedly support learning to hear English and read local subtitles early
Otherwise, you end up being *that* person who chooses to take a child to the cinema to watch a Narnia film with English audio and local subtitles and whisper-reads the subtitles OUT LOUD to said child
Don't be that person or you *will* get very loudly and passive-aggressively shushed
At what grade and age do you start having English lessons
In Denmark we begin at first grade, age 7
> traveling, language exchanges
Not even slightly necessary
My hometown, then nationality (Danish)
I don't really identity myself with the danish regions (Jutland, Zealand etc) but that is mainly because my father is from Zealand and my mother is from Jutland
I have lived roughly 1/3 of my life in the town I was born, 1/3 in Copenhagen and 1/3 where I live now
So I don't really identify with the city or the area where I live
The order is probably: Danish > Scandinavian / Nordic > Northern European > European
I don't identify myself with any of that
Only thing I identify with is my social circle
r/Europe moment
Is Parmesan an Italien region or do you just really like cheese
All i had to play with growing up was a dirty rock and the tears in my eyes
&#x200B;
Just kidding, it was usually video games or football with friends
Squirrel
Seriously it can't be said correctly
It's a cute but unspeakable animal
Most people I know pronouce "three" as twee or tree
I generally cannot pronounce words with z correctly and say it with an s instead
Zone is sone and the like
If I make a buzzing sound for a few seconds (bzzz) I can say the z but it comes out really exaggerated
Megalomaniacal is a fun, seven-syllable rollercoaster
Don't some British pronounce *hate* like the standard pronunciation of *height*?
I was first thinking Finland
I was on a student exchange there a few years ago, and I felt completely like home
Obviously that isn't too far away though, so I was going to say maybe Japan next, although Denmark and Japan are probably just similar in a few ways
I don’t know if it counts as far away, but The Netherlands feels like a brother from another mother
Flat terrain, bad weather, lots of bikes and pretty free spirited people
Sometimes their language even looks like broken Danish
Australia or at least Melbourne felt very familiar for some reason
The people and the vibe felt like summer in Copenhagen
I think Australians and Danes are similar in many areas
New Zealand
It is on the complete opposite side of the world, but I feel their relaxed mentality and informal workplace attitude is just very similar to here in Denmark
Population is around the same size as well, but they of course have waaay cooler nature
Dutch is what they speak in Denmark right, the capital of Sweden
Melbourne is a bit of an outlier though
I lived in Australia for about a year, and they are generally much more conservative, old-fashioned and religious than we are when you get outside of Melbourne and Sydney
I would say New Zealand is much closer to how we are
You don't like
Can't all sound beautiful like italian
Ever since I saw this video, I have been compelled to visit
Seems like such a nice place
I think you're overestimating the effect English is having on smaller European countries
As long as the state enforces the national language in schools, bureaucracy and national media, our languages are in no danger
It's the smaller dialects and minority languages that are going to die out as more and more people assimilate to the main dialect or language
But I'm talking about a language surviving as the main tongue of the majority of the population, not the supremacy of said language in every field
Speaking as a Dane, our film industry have always struggled and primarily survived on state funding
It's true that English material is being consumed to a greater degree than before, but I think that is just an effect of more people being able to understand it
I would actually say that some of the best and most succesful Danish movies have been made in the last 15 years
Are there no domestic movie making about Ireland at all
I thought the Irish government were big on supporting Irish culture
That's interesting, but yeah it probably boils down to language
Danish Movies are a big part of pop culture here
What is the most unique landscape you have near where you live
I actually live close to two - the Wadden Sea, the worlds biggest tidal flats, with imense  biodivercity
Just above the Wadden sea, we along the west coast - we get sand dunes
And I believe it was about 200 years ago, to stop the sand dunes from blowing everywhere - they planted the area with a special strong grass types and pine trees
This creates this unique looking landscape
On top of the landscape being very unique, the wildlife is super interesting too
Being a big area, actually owned by the military - few people other than people in their summerhouses live here
Which makes it ideal for animals
We have one of the biggest populations of deer, where it is not uncommon to see herds of 70, even 100 deers just grassing next to the road
As Denmark has no natrual predators bigger than the fox (We got perhaps like 6 wolves now, but that is far from enough to do anything) the deer simply live in peace
And the ones in this area, are so used to tourists, they don't give a damm
So you can often get so you are only a few meters  from them before they run off
&#x200B;
Edit some pictures: [Wadden sea] B[irds at the Wadden Sea]
[The overgrown sanddunes] [An other image of the overgrown sanddunes with pine trees] [Deer walking in the nature]
Nice post - I'm sorry if I'm being pedantic, but we do have a larger predator than the fox, even if we don't count the wolves that have been coming back in the recent years
The badger is normally regarded as the biggest Danish land-predator (even though it mostly just eats worms, grubs and insects)
The grey seal is of course even bigger, we don't usually count that as a land predator
Neither badgers, gray seals or foxes are of course as you mentioned, no threat for the deers
Not the most unique thing here, but I live in Sønderborg right down by the water of “Flensburg Fjord” so I can see Germany from my window
I've never heard of this but it sounds really cool
Thanks for telling about it
That looks so cool
I've visited the petrified forest in Arizona, but that is very different from this
That Blue lake looks intense
Thank you for sharing
That looks stunning
That looks really special
Thank you for sharing this
Looks like a wine lovers dream to go here
I goggled  Burren  and that looks so special
That's amazing
This looks really cool
And I got a fondness of the Romans
So, would love to come see one day
I've driven past this area once
It is incredible
Did not stop and get out though
I should next time
I am so jealous of mountains, I love mountains
This place looks to beautiful
Yees we have this too
It can be very beautiful
The sanddunes goes straight into heartland as well
When the lavender blooms, it is so pretty
Denmark is in a very similar position actually
200 years ago about 80%-90% of Jutland was heathland
Now nearly all of it is fields
Which country is this
That looks amazing
Thank you for sharing
That's so cool
Thanks for sharing
Denmark is also very flat
Most of it is just fields, and flat areas
So, having this nature by the sea is a huge relief, and the fact I live by the sea, or else I'd go insane if I couldn't be in beautiful nature
That is how it always is haha
Gotta lure in the tourists
Wao that's soo cool
I want to go here now
Do you have any roman ruins near by
For if you do, perfect holiday location to go to for me (I got a Roman obession haha)
That is a pitty
But do you know why they plant the tress though
Yep
I'm going
This is so cool
Thank you for telling about this location
Interesting
What a drama that is honnestly
But thank you for telling me about this
Here we make huge pine tree plantations, because of our Christmas trees
Which we basically supply the whole north with
But we never have forest fires here
So, it's not that bad
We've used Teams from the get-go but I'm back in physical school now
We have had physical school since april, and will/are having physical exams
However, only the students on their last year are currently in school, so school's much more empty than usual
Also, some exams are cancelled, so we only have 3
But tbh, compared with what most of the rest of the world is going through with quarantine and restrictions, social life being slightly restricted, my daily life is not all that different from before
Good ol' Middelfart
In Denmark, we have Tarm which translates to intestine, Sæd which translates to Semen, København/Copenhagen which translates to Buy A Harbor (Køb En Havn), Århus which is Year House, Aalborg which is Eel Castle, and finally the infamous Middelfart which is hilarious to foreigners
We also have an app called Fartkontrol which means Speed Control that tracks speed traps in traffic
EDIT: Sengeløse (bedless), Vanløse (waterless), Stenløse (stoneless)
We have middelfart
"Lem" - Limb = Penis
"Tarm" - Intestine
"Sæd" - Semen
And many others
All of the above, and all the other weird city names, are from The west part of Denmark called Jylland (Jutland)
* Lem (Penis)
* Sæd (Semen)
* Middelfart (Is funny in english)
* Røved (Røv means Ass)
* Tørskind (Litterally translates to "Dryskin")
* Hørmested (Hørm means to smell bad/foul, sted means place
* Helved (Means Hell)
* Pikhede (Penis heat)
* Sædballe (Semen butt)
* Bøsserup (Fag ville)
* Knepholt (Knep means to fuck, holt sounds like "Halt
* Snave (Tongue kissing)
* Karens Klit (Karens Clit)
We got two cities fairly close to one another called Tarm and Lem
Their names respectively can be translated to scrotum and penis
We have Middelfart
It’s not that weird in our language, but for the English speakers, it’s somewhat funny :)
We have a town called Sæd which means sperm
Denmark:
Hørmested: "Smelly Place"
Mygdal: Mosquito Valley
Tarm: Intestine
Balle: Buttock
Which is placed right after the city 'Hoed': Head
Mosbjerg: Moss Mountain
In Denmark you have the ocean called Kattegat
Kattegat can mean "Cat's butt"
[Copenhagen/Great Copenhagen train stations directly translated ]
Mørke (Darkness)

I haven't seen Vikings so I wont know but it is an ocean that lies between Norway, Sweden and Denmark, so it is very likely
The only thing that comes to mind is the huge Fireworks Explosion accident in Kolding in 2004 which only killed 1 person however so there maybe is worse accidents
Probably the [firework disaster in seest ] atleast that’s what I remember as being the worst
Luckily not many were injured or killed, but the disaster took out a whole lot of that town
[here’s a video]
Milan airport disaster
A few years ago a truck carrying beer hit an oncoming train and shredded 8 people almost beyond recognition
The accident happened bacause the cargo wasn't tied down properly, so it just fell right into the side of the front car
Also, many years ago a new, fast train had it's maiden voyage
A lot of passengers where on it when it crashed and tipped to the side
It was never talked about a lot back then, the passengers (including kids) who lost their loved ones were told to just get over it
The train crash on Storebælt 2 January 2019
8 killed
You made me nose exhale, thank you, good sir
I’ve had 6 deaths within 7 years, two of them quite tragic
God never entrede my mind once
I began meditation though With a purely spiritual not religious purpose

I am confused
It's immediately apparent as soon as people say that, that have never visited Sweden
God I've had that one as well
For some reason people seem to think that out of 5
6 million people I would know their one friend
No, not a single snowflake has been spotted this year
It was very hard for me to get into any form of Christmas spirit this year
It just didn't really feel like Christmas at all
"This year" its been like this for atleast 5 years

You just want to rub it in, how many wars and landmass we’ve lost
Not cool man
I'm thinking countries smaller than and maybe including Luxembourg
Once in the train I heard a woman speak a language I didn’t recognise in any way
It was the most beautiful thing I’d ever heard
I have absolutely no idea what it was though, and I don’t think I’ve heard it since
Ayee
Unfortunately, regular danish is potato danish
Even the Welsh are mocking us now lol

Lol
Erik af Pommern was born in Darlowo  and was king of Denmark from 1396-1439
We technically had a Pomeranian regent, although he was just for show and was loyal to queen Margheth the first
It would've been very common when most countries were still considered monarchies I think
I mean just look at personal unions within my own country: Denmark-England, The Kalmar Union, Denmark-Norway, Denmark-Schleswig, Denmark-Holstein, Denmark-Saxe Lauenburg, Denmark-Iceland etc
Etc
I thought the german noble was thrown out and replaced with a Danish prince, whose line continued (with a break) until you removed monarchy for good
Christian I (1448-1481) was also foreign-born
He was before Christian I, though
That Iceland was still under danish rule
Back in second grade or so, a substitute teacher insisted that when X > Y, it actually means Y is bigger
English teacher saying that a cheetah was called "gepard" in English
Since that is the Danish word for cheetahs
My teacher teacher tried to tell me once that Colombus discovered 'Murica, despite the fact that we're living in the country that actually did
It was in 1937
Here's the radio press release:
And it was in reaction to the Dutch fascist party who kept claiming red was orange
the issue of course is as well that gymnasium means something different depending on the country - even though we all use the term
In Denmark, for example, it's basically our version of sixth form for the smarter kids (we're there from around 16 to 19), whereas in Germany it's for much younger smarter students, and is more like secondary
It can really create some confusion when you use the term across borders, because the different systems have very different ideas of what a gymnasium is

Probably "De higer og søger
I gamle bøger" roughly "They long and seek
In old books" from the poem "The Golden Horns" 1802 by [Adam Oehlenschläger] who also wrote the lyrics to our national anthem
The poem is about the [Golden Horns of Gallehus] written shortly after the horns were stolen from the National Museum, and sadly melted down
I would say:
"I Danmark er jeg født, der har jeg hjemme, der har jeg rod, derfra min verden går."

By H. C. Andersen
One of my personal favorites is from Holberg's play "Jeppe på Bjerget" (["Jeppe on the Hill"] in English) a comedic play from 1722
In short, the play is about the drunkard peasant who gets drunk and fall asleep on a dung hill
The Baron and his men find him, and decide to pull a prank on him
They dress him in the Baton's clothes, place him in the Baron's bed, and play along as if Jeppe is the Baron when he wakes up
Upon waking the bewildered Jeppe asks himself (contemporarily rephrased):
>Drømmer jeg, eller er jeg kommet i himmerrige
In English:
>Am I dreaming, or have I entered into heaven/paradise
The play has it's more serious sides, showing how Jeppes wife beats and abuses him, which gives the second famous quote:
>De siger Jeppe drikker, men de siger ikke *hvorfor* Jeppe drikker
In English:
>They say Jeppe is a drunkard, but they don't say *why* Jeppe is a drunkard
walk onto the bike paths
seriously, noone walks there and there are big bike pictures - how hard can it be to understand
another thing is using taxis
one thing is that they are very expensive, another is that public transport will get you everywhere much easier and cheaper
Don't step out on the bicycle paths
And this is from a Dane, who has nearly crashed so many times exactly because of this
Viset the little mermaid in copenhagen, your gonna get disapointed

This is my rule of thumbs, regarding any swedish people

Can confirm
dutch beer is a joke :(
I always tell foreigners here that they should regard the bike paths as roads or highways
For them a designated bike path is like a leisurely trail, where you can stop up to gawk at a map or maybe have a sip of water
There are simply too many bikes here trying to get to their destination to be able to do that
Either bike or get of the road
12 min/ 10 km in a taxi is 200kr
Lets make a deal: You stay away from the sidewalk, we stay away from the bike paths
that's what the bell is supposed to mean
Like pant in Denmark, I guess
It's not empty forming, and the bikes will go through you rather than around
On the bright side, if you're American you get to experience a free ambulance ride and will probably get your broken leg fixed for free because no one in hospital will have the slightest idea of how you can even charge for that kind of thing
>I mostly remembered to stay out of the bike lane, but sometimes I forgot
And then: Suddenly you remembered
of course the bike paths are next to the pedestrian paths; they are, however, on an entirely different level and made with asphalt instead of tiles
haha and you cant see anything anyways cause it's filled with tourists taking pictures for some reason
Talking loud and taking shoes off in someone's home are the same here in Denmark tho
So Denmark
I can understand if it's hard to tell what is a bike path and what is a pedestrian street on the countryside, but in Copenhagen they are clearly marked and look [like this] with every single pedestrian *not* walking on the lower-leveled, bike-marked path full of bicycles
when in Rome do as the romans
yeah
I ''saw'' the Starry night in New york
There were so many people, you couldn't see anything, and the painting was so small and in far away
Huh, that's weird
Altho the rest of Denmark views those 2 cities (especially Copenhagen) as the more entitled cities
Where I'm from (mid-west Jutland) people who talk loudly are usually told to shut the fuck up
the blue ones are only in the very center of Copenhagen (guess they got too tired of tourists not getting the point), whereas my example is in the entirety of Copenhagen as well as other larger danish cities
the 60 km/h sign is for cars, not sure why they're always placed all the way on the other side
Here in Denmark, it's a guilty pleasure
We have long tradition for super nice design so naturally there's a lot of hate for IKEA -mass produced and not always super nice design
However, everybody have furniture from there and to some  love it for it's super down to earth functionality and cheap price
And of course the restaurant is a place for itself
Same in Denmark
Although their kitchens are surprisingly good quality, compared to the other "off the shelf" kitchens you can buy here
Maybe I’m a filthy Copenhagener but I would say it’s seen as the standard
A little flimsy, sure, but not *bad*. I think every household has some ikea items
I think it's a matter of where you are in life and your economic situation
Many young people are fine with ikea furniture, but once you've got a couple of higher quality pieces in your home, ikea's does feel a bit flimsy
Still decent quality for the price tag, but not compared to better (but more expensive) pieces
How dare you

Honestly, I'm not aware enough of the political implications and diplomatic relationships that are probably (hopefully
) nurtured through these bases
However, the only American base within the Kingdom, that I know anything about, is Tullebasen on Greenland
Which, yeah, isn't exactly a base with a good reputation
I mean, my best friend lost her dad when she was 24, primarily because of what happened at Tulle
I'm pretty sure the Muricans need the base in Greenland more than we do
&#x200B;
So I always consider letting them stay there as payment covering what we should be paying in NATO, and if they want to leave NATO, they can leave that base
nothing
denmark is closely allied with america and works well with them on various military assignments
i dont really care if there would be placed a base in Denmark
but
im not sure if denmark is a good location for a military base
except maybe bornholm, our little island just south of sweden

Almost all dairy products
In most of the world they don't have the climate for it, and where they do, they don't have quite the culture for it like in Europe
But but, the difference in the cheese also determines what you use it for

We have 1 'baltic' store
It has Lithuanian and Polish wares

Not really

They have some much cultural influence, so many alliances, wars, colonial time etc
It has been Ukraine for a while
And I like to read about surrounding countries as well
I can't really put it in short
But my fascination includes; The megatrend of the Eurasian steppe meeting European agricultural cultures in Ukraine
Some of the processes of building national identities and nationstates that we in the West went through 100-150 years ago are taking place right now
The crazy complex ethnic mosaic over time
For instance in some ways the settlement of Southern Ukraine is really similar to the settlement of the American Midwest - attracting settles from all over (Swedes for instance
The riftzone between Catholicism and Orthodoxy and the religious mosaic in general
The bloody history of the "short twentieth century and the "bloodlands". (*Imagine you are born in 1900 and you are lucky enough to survive to you are 75
Then you would experience (weak word), first world war, civil war (were Ukraine was especially intense and complex), de-kulakization, hunger, Stalins repressions, second world war (including among many things holocaust by bullets, interethnic conflict and a multitude of partisan movements), hunger (again), the thaw under Khruschev and relative economic progress under Khruschev and Brezhnev
And this is just putting it simply*)
I find most countries' history interesting, but I definitely find European & East Asian the most interesting
Not OP, but several reasons
For one, your country's history overlaps with ours
Russia was founded by Vikings (from Sweden albeit, but still) and even the name derives from them
That's an intriguing connection with a country that is otherwise viewed as rather alien
That alien part also plays into it
Russia is European, even Northern European like us, yet sits at the border of Asia and has historically kind of done its own thing
Religiously, Orthodoxy has been outside the whole Protestant-Catholic schism, and is itself very interesting
There is, I'm sure, some degree of orientalist fascination - the meeting of the familiar and the odd
1800-1850s Copenhagen
There are some areas of the city i really want to see what looks like
Super basic but as someone born in 2003, I'd like to experience the super early internet
I figured a lot of it is just nostalgia jerking but it still sounds kind of interesting
I don’t even know the full version of my own national anthem, do you expect me to know others as well
A bit sad, but Idk
I know a couple of lines of the anthem of Sweden, Norway, Germany and Great Britain
All our neighbours
Would say almost everyone recognize and remembers the Russian one
I know the german really well Cause i’m part german but i also know the melody of the UK and irish pretty well
That is long, rip the Greeks
Among a lot of young people it's cool, but for adults we just see them as being dumb

Danish TV-shows are usually short, but I think the show with most episodes is Bamses Billedbog (Bamses Picturebook) it was a childrens show that ran from 1983 to 2008
If I take reality shows into consideration it would probably be Paradise Hotel which have 17 seasons with 40 or more episodes in each season
The dialect that people from near the German border, in Southern Jutland, speak, is nearly incomprehensible
Unfortunately, I ended up in said region for work
Fortunately, the dialect is one that the native speakers don't really pull out except among themselves
But I will occassionally overhear it and they may as well be Japanese for all that I can undertand of it
Sønderjysk (the area right north of germany) is almost a separate language
The people from South Denmark, sønderjyder, are impossible to understand
I'd say in many ways the dialects of Thybomål, Sønderjydsk and Alsisk, basically work as their own language - Bornholmsk at times as well
My grandmothers husband was from Als and my grandfather came from the Thy area, both of them were able to 'switch between the languages', so they would speak Thybomål and Alsisk with people who spoke the dialect, and 'Danish' with an accent, when people didn't.
The example I always give people to show how far the 'languages' are from each other is the word for the wheelbarrow
**Danish:** Trillebøren
**Alsisk:** Kritbaren
**Thybomål:** Æ tri'bør
That's it in part, but I think a bigger factor is that the traditional, ethnically Russian part of Russia is actually quite small
The vast majority of the country only became Russophone in the last few centuries, if at all, do dialects haven't really had time to diverge
My dad lives in the north, and his elderly neighbours speak Vendelbomål (similar to Thybomål), and it makes no sense to me
How does “deærjøwt
” mean the same as “det er super
” (“That’s great
Not to mention how it all sounds like one word, which makes it even harder to decipher lol
I love the different dialects, but they’re not always the easiest to understand
It is relevant if you want to discuss dialects
It is the reason why Denmark, which is a very small country, has (or at least had until recently) a vast number of very different dialects
The US, meanwhile, has much less dialectal diversity - insanely little, compared to the land-area
The reason is that DK has been inhabited by the same people for many thousands of years, so that the dialects on two islands may have had millennia to diverge
In Russia, meanwhile, much of the country used to speak different languages until recently
When they all shifted to Russian, that led to a much more homogeneous linguistic situation
Where I am on Fyn, like 4 or 5 times a year
It melts as soon as it hits the ground
Rarely, it's only five times a year-ish
It stays on the side of the road for a week though
A lot less than it used to
We used to get at least some snow every winter, but in the past decade, snow has been getting rarer and rarer
Like semi-accurate ... It's an exaggeration of course but it's a big deal when it snows here
If you call a relative in an area where it snowed that day it's the first thing they will tell you
The news will report if they think there will be snow on Christmas and that's also kind of a big deal
Oh that's interesting, where in Northern Greece, like city or region
I want to compare numbers with Fyn
Engineers being the
I'm pretty sure only the  Americans do that and we all have a version of "milliard".
We do the same in Denmark

Not necessarily true - I'm used to the 1

It used to be the other way, until someone, somewhere, made a mistake, and then it stuck
I don't think anyone really cares
Religion, or lack thereof, is seen as a private matter for the most part
It's a private matter
But expressing that you are religious is definitely weirder than expressing that you're an atheist
People don’t really care if you are an atheist or Christian so long as you behave
Overall people are neutral to atheists like me
Simply not believing in a god is very common, and in most circles you would most definitely be considered more weird for going to church every Sunday than for not believing in anything
I think the word "atheist" (ateist) can be a bit loaded, though, because many people think it means "antitheist". Because of that, whenever the topic of religious affiliations come up (for example when I have to tell people why I'm not confirmed), I often find it easier to just call myself a "nonbeliever" (ikke troende)

Not sure about the question
Does someone say pesh instead of pest
I'll pronounce it Budapesht when Hungarians pronounce Copenhagen "København".
> Does someone say pesh instead of pest
Like the entire population of Hungary says Budapesht
I think it's a monolingual thing
I haven't been there so have never heard it
Amazing question
German for sure
I love Germany, and it annoys me that I can't speak, and only barely understand, the language when I visit
So German would be an easy first pick
Second pick would be Faroese
Only spoken by like 50,000 people, but I plan to move there in a few years so I'm obviously gonna need to learn the language at some point
And they're part of the Realm of Denmark, so it kinda makes sense for Danes to learn the language at least a little bit
I guess I would go for Swedish for the third pick
I can understand Norwegian just fine, but Swedish rarely makes sense to me
Would probably be nice to be able to understand our neighbors
I’d go with Spanish, Arabic and Russian
Mainly because they probably have the most amount of countries speaking them, and I plan on someday riding around the world on a motorcycle
I didn’t pick Mandarin because, while there are more people speaking it, it is limited to few countries other than China
English Spanish and Chinese
That allows me to do business with ~80% of the world’s population
Imo there’s nothing interesting going on in Sweden that you won’t be able to read about in english on thelocal
Not that interesting, unfortuneately
I plan to move there and teach, because it’s just the perfect place for me to live
Nice and quiet with lots of nature
Big contrast to Denmark
Ah, well that’s a relief
I’m visiting the Faroes in December (if corona allows) and was worried I would seem rude if I just speak Danish
I plan to move there to teach in like three or four years, but haven’t really priortized learning the language yet, and it sounds like I don’t really need to, so that’s nice
Does angstschreeuw mean anxiety scream
Because  "Angstskrig" is the Danish word with most consonants in a row
> the convention to represent certain sounds with digraphs
imho still better than inserting even more diacritics in the language; you guys already have, I think, four different diacritics to add to letters
Now, that I think about it you *could* write 'szczekuszkowate' as 'ṡċekuṡkowate'...
I propose a splling reform
I’ll be teaching English and history
But yeah, I’ll definitely need to learn the language sometime
It's a bust
If you're in a classic Danish bar, don't ring the bar bell (it's really a ship bell) at the bar itself unless you're willing to pay a lot
If a guest rings the bell it means they want to buy a round for everyone in the bar/pub
Sometimes the staff will use it to signal "Last round
" as well though
Although it's an easy way to become popular if you ever ring it so I won't tell you to absolutely *never* do it
I've done it a few times but usually not when the places were at their busiest
It's a nice way to meet and talk to people if it's a place you're not too familiar with
Apparently, there's an important rule that I never knew until recently
If there's a bell in a pub and you ring it then the next round is on you
I had to leave because several people came over to me and demanded I pay
> If there is money on the side of the pool/snooker table, it means that someone has reserved the next game so you shouldn't 'jump the queue'.
We do the same, except we usually play a type of five-pin billard
People do that automatically in Sweden
We always need to go and kindly ask people, if they would be so nice as to take a table in the central room
It's the same thing in Köln, where they just patrol the halls with a rack of kölsch
They are fairly anal about the beer being fresh, so the glasses are also only 20 cl or so
Does the waiter keep track of your beers by noting the mat at you guys
Or do they note it in another way
What did you think the bell was for
Just frivolous noise-making
It takes longer to pour as it needs to settle
If you order it first, the barman can pour the Guineeses first, pour other drinks meanwhile and finish the Guinness
You had it on casks, which is the traditional vessel for beers, and if I remember correctly it was served as a mix between a freshly opened cask and one that was a few days older
If you ever have had a beer from cask you will know they are very light in carbonation, similar to what Guinness aims to mimick with the nitrogen
But since casks can be troublesome, given that they have to be managed properly, as once the cask is tapped, the beer inside changes radically in the course of a few days, while a keg can last for a month easily, more breweries have shifted to kegging their beer
And that's why Guinness wanted to do the whole nitro thing
Edit: thinking of it, I also think the whole "two pour"-system comes from back in the day, where it was mixed, as you'd pour 2/3s fresh and top it off with 1/3 aged beer
Drunk me says definitely
Well, many beers outside of heavy gravity stuff like doppelbock, barleywine and imperial stout usually gets stale about 3/4ths through
>  it's usually foreign brands who come up with these weird non-beer glasses
Or else it's just the best suited glass for the beer
Any beer that is just mildly aromatic benefits greatly from [a glass like this] or [this] from the two very non-foreign breweries, De Dolle Brouwers and the legendary Rodenbach
Well, that's more to do with old limitations and traditions
The Czechs manage to do a perfect hladinka in 10 seconds
All you need is a specific draught system
Guinness is served with nitrogen, which makes it pour differently
Edit: to follow up, here's an article about the Czech style side-pull faucets, with a quote about how quick they can pour three of the mythical 7 minute pours in just 11 seconds
[“It was fascinating to me that they could pour half-liters that fast,” he says
“It’s very different than the urban myth back here, you know, the ‘seven-minute pour
’ I taped a guy, and he filled three beers in 11 seconds
And the guy at Na Parkánu was doing something similar
That's the wheat beer pour
What Mediterranean beers have you seen in that sort of glasses
Most of them are pale lagers, which I can't remember ever seeing having a branded wine-glass/teku/snifter
I mostly have seen it for British, American and Belgian hop-forward beers and sour beers like vlaamse rood and some lambics
Yeah, I wrote a bit on this elsewhere in the thread, regarding what they did before nitrogen pours, that they used to mix beer from an old cask with beer from a fresh one
Interestingly I read a few hours ago that during the switch over period, they used to mix steel kegged nitrogen Guinness with a about a 1/3 from the old wooden cask, just to prove to people that there was no taste difference between the two
It's a great webpage in general, they have some neat articles
Yeah, as long as the beer settles, it's all good
Like you gotta ask yourself, would they ever sell the beer in cans, where it is practically only possible to serve it in one pour, if it "ruined the beer".

It's kinda split between calling it Australia or Oceania,  but lately it has become more common to be taught Oceania, which I think is the more correct term

It's excellent
We have dedicated bike lanes almost everywhere
I ride my bike to school for about 7km and it's very rare that I'm not on a bike lane
In Copenhagen it has always been quite good, and the way the infrastructure is laid out hasn't changed much
[Here's an example from the 40s] and [the same place today]
The more recent and very welcome addition is a bunch of new bridges crossing the harbour
Cycling infrastructure in the countryside is more lacking, but generally fine in towns and cities
Excellent
It's my favorite mode of transportation
We miss a national plan though
The cycling infrastructure is good many places, but it's also lacking many places
Where we live, we have excellent separate bike lanes/paths some places, but (maybe) because of that, the municipality sort of thinks they don't need to do anything other places
I hope they build out the bike highways even more, so electric bikes can move more cars off the road
And Aarhus could use a widening of certain bike paths, like they have in Cph
While it is world class here for sure, our cities are still built around cars
I’ve cycled in the Netherlands and it is more pleasant and feels safer than in Cph
There, it really feels like streets were designed for cycling, and cars only allowed if there was enough space, and always on the cyclists’ premises
One thing I’ve noticed in Sweden was the lack of a curb/level difference between cycle path and pavement
Small detail but definitely think it makes people pay less respect to the bike path

Awesome :-)
Well, yeah, usually
It's not the middle ages anymore
Yes that Bohr

Cnut the Great died in 1035
He was:
1016-1035 King of England
1018-1035 King of Denmark
1028-1035 King of Norway
Also known as the North Sea Empire
Yeah, let's skip the KalmarReunion and do the North Sea Empire again instead
We're not on the lads on tour/hen party/chav holiday circuit, so the British tourists here are some of the most well-behaved
On behalf of Copenhagen, massive thanks to Amsterdam, Budapest, Magaluf, Prague etc for diverting that particular traffic away from us
Yes
We get the kind who have read *The little book of Hygge* and enjoyed watching *Borgen*. Thanks
That plus weather explains the chav holiday no show, but Copenhagen could be a lager lout destination akin to Amsterdam - I guess how expensive everything is works as a very efficient deterrent
Writing this in a cafe that charges £3

In Denmark they have already been back a month or so and there is pretty safe here too
I don't have kids, but I wouldn't be afraid to send them back to school if I had kids
very low rate here, lowest in the whole country
No i don't have any bad feelings about starting again
I started again 3 months before the summer holiday and I couldn't worry less
Most likely there is or was active covid cases in your municipality they just were asymptomatic and therefore never reported
yeah but look how your country ended up
Sverige er bare et shitshow
Well currently Denmark needs a third and a fourth wave as well to get even somewhat close to Swedens deaths per capita
True, selv deres statsminister indrymmede at det var en lorte beslutning
Hele deres ide med slet ikke at lukke ned, kan jeg slet ikke forstå. Men danmark bliver nok også ramt af en anden bølge også må vi se hvor vi ender henne på skalaen, men tvivler stærkt vi overhaler svenskerne
Our former PM Lars Løkke Rasmussen once dropped this golden nugget in a parliamentary debate:
"So we have chosen to create a system, where you have to hand over, a little less than what you did before
This is what we have chosen, and this of course leads to, that the people who earns more, and pays more, now pays a little less, well, they'll pay more less than the people, who earns a little less and pays less, but who is paying less less
Here's the YouTube link, obviously it's in Danish, but its still a good watch
Unfortunately mostly negative associations
Mobile thieves, beggars and gypsies
Although my personal view are that you are very patriotic, proud of your country, excellent educated youth especially in IT and a mixture of latin and slavic language
Very happy you're a part of the EU
Currently it could be seen better, but I believe it is changing, as more and more Romanians work and study in Denmark, and Romanians together with Poles are well set to become the biggest immigrant groups in Denmark
Also, it seems like people are slowly opening up the eyes to the country as a travel destination
I was recently(like 2 weeks ago) at a wedding in Western Romania, and ran into a huge group of Danish travellers outside the metropolitan cathedral in Timișoara
Romanians are not seen particularly positively as far as I can tell
>  If we can't talk in English, they either talk or understand Hungarian
Where did you go in Romania
I have yet to meet a non-Hungarian Romanian, who understands Hungarian
As a percentage of the population, Bulgaria actually has more Roma people ([10% in Bulgaria vs 3% in Romania]
>de ce românii sunt obsedați de opiniile altora despre noi
Nu e foarte anormal să căuta recunoaștere, în Danemarca suntem la fel
Cred e din cauză că suntem o țară mică, și pentru România poate fi pentru că multe oameni în Europa au pareri proaste despre România
Scuză-mă orice greșelile, nu încă stiu română perfect

I love that I could rock up at one of the liquor stores at 3 in the night, talk with a dude through a window and buy beers to take home before catching the airplane
I've been in Cluj several times, as I have some friends and acquaintances who live there, but the only person I know who knows Hungarian is from a Romanian Hungarian family
>Transylvanian Romanians are often as bilingual as the seklers
In Harghita, Covasna and Mures maybe,but outside those counties you will be hardpressed to find anyone, who isn't of Hungarian or mixed heritage, that knows more Hungarian than igen, pálinka and egeszsegedre
Thanks, I always get a bit uncertain, when it is longer, and I need to write more complicated things
Yes, but people confuse them with Romanians because the names are so similar
Gypsie is simply is slur for rRomani-people
Prietenii mei românii din diaspora cred la fel, și că strain, ei sună și arată că ”the real thing”, dar sunt frică nu are o șanșă la alegeri în noiembrie
You went to the Non-Stop Liqour Store at Strada Emil Isac, right at the end of the park
But that is also a old generation, that lived closer to the time, when the Hungarians were in charge
De asemenea care județ ești de unde
Oh no surely
My grammatical skills could need some improvement, I still don't know how to correctly use all the "Mie, ție, îți, își, ne, lor etc"-things, so I try to avoid them :)
Mulțumesc frumos, am învățat pentru aproape trei ani :)
But Bihor is also very close to the Hungary itself, and Oradea was almost 50-50 just a decade ago, I don't know if that can maybe have had some influence on how well people knew Hungarian, compared to Cluj
The family in Maramureș don't know any Hungarian at all tho, even though there is also a notable community
> As you can imagine it was crazy for an outsider like me
But it made me realize how beautiful a moment like that can be
This is what I love about Transylvania, the only thing is that it could have been so much cooler, if all the Germans had remained, instead of being sold to West Germany
>But I know that one person's opinion does not reflect the majority
And even if the majority has a wrong opinion, that still doesn't matter because among them there are people worth more than the majority :)
Also usually ignorance doesn't necessary contain malice, only when it is willful ignorance
It's funny how Slovenian is sort of the exact reciprocal to Romanian
A Slavic language with Romance influence, as well as some German and Hungarian
Depends a lot on your region
There are tons of shared customs and traditions between Northern Romania, Ukraine and Poland
Parts of it definitely is, but the country is more or less split three ways
I mean, if I'm not mistaken, Galicia/Asturias and the western British isles are part of the same ecoregion - the North-Atlantic Rainforest
What that essentially means is that the regions have similar climates (equally wet, misty, etc
) and, as a result, similar floras
Culturally, they are very distinct ofc
, but even then, there is a pretty long history of intermingling
Some ppl overstate the "Celticness" of Galicia (despite its name, it hasn't been Celtic for nearly 2k years, and even then, the Celts didn't originate there), but still, Galicia and Wales-Cornwall-Ireland are all essentially neighbouring regions from a nautical perspective
You could probably lump the Basques into that mix as well
A high steel observation tower build for for a big fair a long time ago
I know what you thinking, it's not Paris
Behind the church is the oldest “house” in the city
It’s barely even a ruin, but a bit there is
Town of 3000 in population
In Danish it's also hammer, although the name for sledgehammer, Mukkert, is a lot more hammersounding
Not sure since I don't have a lot of friends in that age group
As a 19 year old student with a part time job on the side I'll be saving around €6000 this year
So it very much depends on whether or not you live in Copenhagen (and surrounding areas) or another one of the big(ger) Danish cities
In Copenhagen
I'd say unless you have all the luck in the world (meaning somehow managed to get an apartment that's less than 1120+ EUROs per month all included, either through parents buying it or a stroke of luck) then you save next to nothing - and whatever you save you would probably spend on bigger expenses like dentist or technology
The average wage or a newly educated adult with a master's degree is around 30
000kr, meaning 2900 EUROs before tax
After tax you have around 19000kr left, which is 1800 EUROs
If you pay what most pay in rent, then around 1100 of these euro, go to just rent, water and gas, leaving you with 700 euros to pay for food, insurance, transport, union, A-kasse, etc
Let's be conservative (e.g. frugal) and say you can pay for all of that for 600 euros (that would be VERY CHEAP), leaving you with less than 100 euros to save and you still haven't spent a single dime on anything that isn't basic expenses - so no coffee or beer with friends, no trip to the cinema or expenses on Netflix, HBO, whatever
So I would say 50 EUROs, if you are frugal, could be saved for bigger expenses when those arise
Or, you could decided to live in another city than Copenhagen like Aarhus and pay half the rent you would in Copenhagen, or even Odense and Aalborg and pay even lower than half the rent
If you live any of those places you'd likely be able to save around 300 to 800 euros each month depending on the city
I live with my mom :)
I pay transport (€50 monthly), fitness membership (€25 monthly) and other smaller payments
Around €150 a month
Groceries a bit but I don’t pay anything towards mortgage or rent
No difference really
The difference is east vs  west
I mean,  tbf, that would probably happen whatever the case
Technically it's illegal (in town and cities), but it's socially accepted (on nights  out partying) as long it's done privately
Usually we would just stand together in groups and do it
No pasta expert but I feel like the difference expresses itself more in the texture, shape of the pasta and the broader selection rather than the taste itself
Some double-blind tests should be fun
Yep, same deal with a Greenlandic person I spoke to
They had never felt cold in all their years living in Greenland, where it gets stupid cold but is at least dry, but often froze their ass off in Denmark where it's not as cold and humid
Danish has a similar weird spelling but we still don’t have it
We don’t have them in Denmark
We also don’t have as many Indian immigrants as USA lol
I don’t think it’s strange and fits well with American competitive mindset
It's also diktat in Danish
We have it for quite a long time in school
We usually joke, that small kids trying to write Danish as we pronounce words, will often spell as a Norwegian
Sjåfør and sjokolade comes to mind, were we spell it with "ch" in Danish: chauffør and chokolade
You can either vote for a party or a specific person, the party votes are counted first
There are 13 parties
Absolute primodickature
Same with Denmark:
* Denmark proper
* Greenland
* The Faroe Islands
**Copenhagen:** Left-wing students and muslim gangs
**Northern Zealand:** Rich snobs
**Rest of Zealand:** Working class mid-size town and fields
People who vote for the right wing
**Lolland and Falster:** Poor post-industrial depression
**Funen:** Self obsessed people who won't stop talking about themselfs
**Southern Jutland:** Racist farmers
**Western Jutland:** Jesusland
**Eastern Jutland:** Kinda like Zealand, but with an accent
**Aarhus:** Copenhagen, but uncool
**Northern Jutland:** People who vote for the Socialdemocrats
**Bornholm:** Fishermen
**Faroe Islands:** Whalers who can't decide if they like us or not
**Greenland:** Drunk, depressed and cold
Jutland - Farmers
South Jutland - Farmers from Alabama
Fin(n) Island - Wait those exist
Zealand - Rich assholes
> Vaslui: Axe totting,wife beating,alcoholic rednecks and rapists
[Romania's own modern day Game of Thrones reenactors
What's up with Murcia
Makes sense, Copenhagen and the rest of Sjælland is referenced as Sweden here
Copenhagen: Sweden
I wanna add some things:
Copenhagen: Sweden
Bornholm: Sweden
Southern Jutland: Inbred/the Alabama of Denmark
Funen: A highway
No one cares about them
Zealand: Copenhagen/Sweden
> Eastern Jutland: Kinda like Zealand, but with an accent
It's the other way around
You can't say Zealand doesn't have an accent, like with the double vowels and what not
Really
Usually I find it's the opposite for Norwegians, I'm surprised Swedes don't feel the same
Unless you're Scanian of course
This is also true
I lived in Jutland, when I went to efterskole
I’m originally from Zealand
Now I often catch myself pronouncing words with one vowel with two vowels
I also catch other people doing the same and I cringe EVERY time
> Žižkov: The Republic of Žižkov", a bit rough, formerly proletarian (and proud of it) quarter, best pubs, but you have to dance between piles of dog shit to reach them
And navigate through the cannabis haze
Also I knew Žižkov is an old worker area, but does it really have a rough reputation
It's where I always stay in Prague, and never really encountered anything in that regard
Zealand, where "kaffe" is one syllable, but "te" is two
Tbh never actually heard anyone from Zealand saying “kaffe” with one syllable
I love it
My kids are 17 and 20 years old amd they have been to 10-12 different countries in their life
It gives them knowledge of other cultures and hopefully an open mind
It’s nice for when you just want to go on a weekend trip
I believe this [comic] best describes it
School trips are amazing
I've been to Stuttgart, Berlin and London
> Danes go shopping in Germany afaik
I know people who drove 200 km (one way) to buy a washing machine in Germany and apparently they saved money
I mean, culturally we are super similar, but there is still a huge difference between Lapland and South Jutland
The Nordic region is huge
Driving for 6 hours could take me through 3 countries and 4 languages with a bit of luck in the traffic
That's one aspect of the US I've always found
claustrophobic, for lack of a better word
Ppl will talk about how big the US, but for me, the somewhat shocking thing is more how *samy* it is
Obviously Americans will point out the regional differences, and they exist, but on a scale maybe 300x that of Europe
The regional differences between two US states as far apart as Norway and Italy are essentially equivalent to two neighbouring shires in the UK
you’re lucky øresund wasn’t frozen when you crossed
You certainly leave enough behind in Copenhagen for them to constitute a sizeable portion of the 3 AM drunkards
Any drive over 40 minutes is pretty far by Danish standards, especially to Zealanders
A toaster like [this] doesn't seem to be very popular outside Denmark
But we really like rolls and buns here, and they will get stuck inside the foreign type of toaster
Also a cheese slicer like [this] can be found in every kitchen here
Sometimes we use the [Norwegian type] as well, but it makes a mess out of the softer danish cheeses
And I have learned that Germans panic when they rent a summer cottage here, and [this] is the only kind of can opener to be found in the drawers
It doesn't seem that it should be that uncommon elsewhere though
Does Food count
Because I almost exclusively eat “Rugbrød” for lunch and I don’t think it’s common many other places
I mean this is the kind of thing my grandpa experienced as a child
The sink scraper is not common in Denmark
I was very annoyed when I found out not even IKEA sells it here
Seems like a huge waste of cabinet space
How do you open cans then
Yes, but it's convenient that all sizes of bread fits on it
Seems very inefficient to toast the buns that indirectly
Was just about to ask the same - we just use paper towels here
In my experience both are used here
In my family the Norwegian one is used in day-to-day life, and the string type for when guests come over (makes bigger and more uniform slices)
They exist here but they're not a very common variant
We dry them by hand, because why waste an entire cabinet on that
I don't see what's protective about the new kind
Why not just dry them off by hand and then you'll have a whole other cabinet to put stuff into
Also, Moldy dishes
We do use them regularly
I've only ever used one like what you linked to one or twice in my life
The one you usually find here is the [Raadvad model] They are indestructible and are found in every holiday home, our holiday home came with one already in the drawer
But seriously, no one uses them anymore, they are horrible to use, dangerous (one of my friends almost cut his thumb off with one, he is an idiot though) and everyone uses the type in the Wikipedia link
But for some reason it seems to be a topic of frequent complaint from German renters of danish holiday homes
You forgot "má ekki hylja" and "ei saa peittää"
It kinda is - although in my family we keep unused napkins from dinner parties for this purpose, as they may not be entirely clean and therefore can’t really be reused for the next party, but can be used for cleaning the sink
A lot of sinks here have a little grate on top of the drain so you’ll empty that out most of the time, but if you’ve been peeling  carrots or something I find people often use paper towels
Isn't that how all sockets are built
The sockets in my apartment are ancient (don't even have earth) but still have that
What
The logic is that since you don't use a cabinet for air drying dishes and instead dry them immediately you can use that cabinet for other stuff
Oh I thought you were too lazy to dry your dishes manually, and then moved the dishes from the drying cabinet to the dish cabinet once they had air dried
I was like duh
Of course you can keep the dishes in there (as in it could fit dishes) otherwise It'd be pointless
Legalise marijuana
Too much of the police's resources are spend on giving fines to people who smoke marijuana on daily basis
They are going to keep buying marijuana wether it is from the state or some illegal environment, so why not make it into something the state can gain from, instead of some local druglord somewhere
Edit: Or at least just fully decriminalise it
I haven't either, and it's not something I miss in my life
But I guess it is one of those luxuries that can be hard to live without, if you have gotten used to it
Much like aircondition in cars, a fast internet connection and so on
I remember doing fine without either, but now I certainly won't live without
So for that reason - I don't even want to try a bidet
Totally agree
I don't use it myself and don't really know anyone who does (to my knowledge anyway) - but I still want it to be legal for the reasons you mentioned
Free up time for the police to focus on solving crimes that have actual victims
Give the state a new source of income so other taxes can be lowered, or use it to improve hospitals or whatever
And take money away from the gangs
The amount of money being made on the illegal market is huge, and is one of the main things that attracts young people to become "gangsters".
A, once upon a time, close childhood friend of mine has been quite deep into the gang environment and other illegal activities
Last time I talked with him, a little over a year ago, he told me he rather wants marijuana to be illegal because otherwise he would earn less money
Wow I thought you were better than that
I like the idea - but 99% of my fellow Danes would probably wonder why anybody would want to carry cash
ATM's and banks with actual money are getting closed down everywhere here
Well I’d like to know why
I don't go to Copenhagen often, but when I do, I almost always see a couple of Swedes trying to drink themselves to death
I totally support your wish to be able to buy alcohol at all times from normals stores :-)
Many
I live in a small town with a cathedral from the 12th century and a lot of smaller buildings with housing from the same time period
It is honestly a pain in the ass if you try renovate or do anything if you live in that sort of building, but there is usually no problem with amenities such as running water, toilets or anything else you have in a modern home
>Driving on cobblestone paved streets sucks
Doubly so for cycling, I'll take a detour to avoid even small cobblestone sections
Luckily there aren't that many anymore
Wouldn't building a metro in Malta be a waste of money
Like sure, it would cut travel time quite a bit, but wouldn't it take maaaany years, before it would make more money, than it cost to build, since the country is so small
In general, old buildings actually have better insulation than newer ones, due to the thicker walls and smaller windows
They'll have worse heating, though
Ofc
if the building isn't in great shape, with holes in the roof and crevaces under windows, then that'll take its toll on the insulation
Haha, my little town in north jutland has cobblestones all over
I'd consider a house from 1900 semi-old, yeah, but not notably so
It also depends - if it's a free-standing house, 1900 is quite old
If it's a big apartment-block or a house-row, they can easily be a lot older
Suburbs in general are a younger phenomenon
Danish multi-party coalition system, currently 9 parties in parliament, lots of choice
Youth binge drinking is clearly here to stay forever, but casual beer drinking among adults is much different than even in the 90s, there's less of it publicly, it's gone from the workplace, and the middle and upper classes have largely moved to wine
Also back in the day there were like 5 different beer options and most drank either Tuborg ("grøn"), Carlsberg ("hof") or Faxe draught beer (if at an event or a football match) - that changed a lot with the craft beer explosion the past few decades, people want to geek out a little over what they consume instead of conforming to the cultural norm
I see a lot of danish traditions being switched out with american ones and it actually makes me kinda sad because I know it’s also a thing in other countries as well
Even our language is adopting english words instead of making up our own new ones
Our dictionary is only like 2000 words long or smthn so i’m afraid the language will die out some day
We do something similar at "fastelavn", unfortunately the snaps never caught on here
> it's gone from the workplace
Good
I've heard a number of stories from my colleagues about how back in the day they knew some guys(not the same ones) who would be useless after midday because they'd be so drunk
Also how it wasn't unusual to have a number of beers for lunch
Sounds scary to me, I'm happy we've moved beyond that
Yoo I totally mistyped
We have 200
000 words and Swedes have 600
000 so you still got us beat
But the average dane only knows around 25
000 words because we barely understand our own language as you swedes probs already know lmao so our situation is still not great
And I agree abt the part with americanisation
I totally reject the traditions and honestly they are so capitalistic that it kinda feels like brain wash sometimes
That’s because they are
We just stress on different letters depending on what we wanna say
How Do People Drive on Small / Narrow Roads
Just curious how people tend to drive on the small or narrower roads where you live
I moved out into the countryside and we live on a narrow road where two normal size cars can pass at the same time
If a large truck comes you have to pull really far over into the grass / dirt
It's usually okay, but sometimes it gets a bit close
Some people will fly trough the small roads at 60 km/h (legal limit btw) especially in areas with blind corners or hills
To me it's completely stupid to do this because you have no idea what's coming .  I drive maybe 30km/h or 40km/h so I have the time to  pull over to the side just in case
Similar problem in cities of course, but usually the speeds are lower
Edit: [Example] of how such roads look
That's pretty cool to hear
Woah
Those roads seem really narrow
I think most people here would think they are bikes only or something
Sorry
REVERSING on a  HIGHWAY
What
What sadness
Wagner was certainly a deeply flawed figure, even by the standards of his time, but to simply dismiss his work as emblematic for this reason is, I think, misguided
Germany has more reason than most to wish to distance itself from the past, but learning from its mistakes is not the same thing as torching those who made them
We have a place called 'Himmelbjerget' translatet 'Skymountain', it might be the higest point in Denmark but its only 150 meters over sea level
> Varkaus= theft
Varkaus was apparently also an old word for "strait", and the city is located on straits in a lake, so it actually does make sense
> The Irish word for Wales translates to Little Britain
I’m sorry
Welsh is the most widely spoken descendant of Brythonic, and the word "Britain" is a Latinised version of a P-celtic name for the Island
You could say, that Wales is the last remnant of pre-Saxon Britain
So "Little Britain" is in fact a pretty appropriate name
There's nothing wrong with that, as Welsh is a modern descendant of Brythonic
Along with Brittany it is the last remnants of pre-saxon Britain
Calling it little Britain seems very apt
Britain, Brittany, Brythonic, Brittania, it's like they are all variations of the same word, huh
But it’s not the highest point in Denmark proper
Himmelbjerget is only 140m, the highest point is Møllehøj at 180m.
No, you have to park at the bottom and buy mountain-climbing equipment from the local store
In Denmark, the big fear is for the Danes to lose influence in the political sense
We are a very small country, with a very small population
We do not want France, Germany or Spain to have more influence in our politics
The Danes are very self-important, and believe Denmark is the greatest place to live
The EU is already too political in my opinion, and should become a trade union
Edit: I was wrong about something, I have corrected my comment
That was embarrasing, lol
You are correct, and I was misinformed
At home 8 hours of sleep have always been a minimum, and we would eat dinner and usually breakfast together everyday
After I moved out, started gymnasium and got a job my time has become far more valuable
I sleep less, have less ridget meal times
I think stress and lacking sleep is very common here, although it depends a lot on where you live, what you work as and your general lifestyle
Do I have time for sleep and a proper meal
It's two of the most important aspects of life
If one day I can't find the time over a longer period ind my life, I should relly consider changing my lifestyle
Of course life can be busy from time to time, but rarely so I miss sleep and food
Denmark: When at home on my own as a student - frozen meals and coffee from the bakery down the street
But I often go visit mom and dad
And here it is sitting around the table and having a big meal everynight
Sleep - I get my sleep
I have a bed time
30 - because I need to wake up at 6
All my friends know this
So if we are playing videogames, I leave and go to bed
That's it
So I always get my sleep
According to my parents all the traditions surrounding our [graduation hats] are quite new
So, when we graduate academic secondary education when we're around 19, we drive around in an open truck all day with our classmates, while stopping at each kid's parents' house to get snacks and drinks
Plus a month of reading vacation where you’re supposed to study for exams but you just party
This is not new, it's so old that it used to be a horse carriage instead of a truck
What *is* relatively new (emerged during the 90's perhaps
) are the traditions surrounding the hat:
* Sex with the hat on - cut a triangle in the cap
* Finish 30 beers all by yourself in 24 hours - cut a square in the sweatband
* Kiss someone of your own sex - turn the cross around
* Have sex with someone of your own sex - remove the cross entirely
* Have sex with a boyfriend/girlfriend with the hat on - a heart in the sweatband
* Getting hospitalized because of too much alcohol - cut the entire shade off and look like an idiot
I could  go on
There is also the "puttefest" - "hazing" rituals for entering high school
A putte means a darling, sweetie etc, and is used for first year academic high school students
In the Copenhagen area, the public puttefest is drinking our brains out in a forest while writing weird stuff on each other
There are also some schools where they turned quite nasty and there were rumours of sexual assault on the first year girls
But according to my friend from Lolland, there, they throw all the first year students in a lake
We have J-day (short for Christmas Day) and P-day (short for Easter Day)
This is when one of the largest breweries in Denmark releases their Christmas/Easter special beer and nearly everyone goes to bars and clubs
That sounds so nice
Nordsjælland here
My gymnasium has a tradition of throwing first yearers down a huge hill
It's very violent but fun
I think in Denmark students used to wear them longer than they do now
At least I have seen lots of pictures from the 50's of university-students wearing their graduation-hats
I know, I’ve watched SKAM
It looked fun but hella expensive
Also the it looked like there could be much drama surrounding it when everybody does it with their own friend group
Like, what if you’re lonely
Sydjylland here
Our Gymnasium has a tradition of making first yearers run UP a hill, while second and third yearers stand on the sides and throw flour, ketchup, milk, water balloons, etc
at them
Østjylland here
My gymnasium called the first years "smølfer" and played [this song] on repeat for the entire first introduction week of school, over the hall and class speakers
We also had separate cantinas and any smølf caught sneaking into the second or third year cantina, was painted blue and forced to wear a smurf costume
in the 1800s it was common to simply wear them all the time, to indicate you were a student - that happened both at university and 'high school'. In the original Nøddebo Præstegård script from 1862, for example, its mentioned that Nikolaj and his brothers all wear them
They were black back then, though ([1970s version of the movie includes the hats] They [became white around the 1920s] and then after WW2 I believe it became common to only wear them at graduation - perhaps because it was harder to get them made/afford them during the occupation
Damn, why don't we have that
Our school threatened us to stop our tradition of violence against the first yearers, it sucks ass
Midtjylland here - at my school on the first day of school, the third year students dress up like on fastelavn an throws glitter at the first years
Also they're called "sutter" (pacifiers or suckers) and they are all handed an inconvienient amount of necklaces with [this candy] on it
Yeah it's very big
But what if it is seperated top/bottom instead of right/left
As far as I recall, the practice stopped during ww2, but I can't say for sure if it wasn't picked up after again
But I know my granddad only wore his on his gradutation day, and he graduated around 1945-ish, maybe a year or two later, can't recall
I also know it was a trend in the 60s and 70s to not have a studenterhue at all, especially amongst hippies and progressives, so likely it wasn't something you wore back them other than on graduation day
My aunt has mentioned more than once she never wore one and almost nobody in her year did (she often teases my dad for having one) and she graduated late 60s/early 70s
Don’t really think we have any cities that feel foreign tbh
Of course if you’re not from Copenhagen, you might think it’s a bit different from the rest of the country given its sheer size
Personally if I were to point out any “cities” I’d mention the ones in southern Denmark close to the German border due to their much different dialect
But it’d be more appropriate to refer to them as towns
Born and raised in Copenhagen
Copenhagen feels the most foreign particularly in the summer during tourist season where even a native dane will be mistaken for a foreigner in the shops
Such an entirely different vibe from other big cities like Aalborg or Aarhus which feels more danish and homey
Not the city but part of it; Nørrebro in Copenhagen
It will probably divide the waters; But first of all, there are a lot of immigrant shops
Secondly, many student live there, so obviously it has a different atmosphere than the rest of the city
Thirdly, it is generally just a very rough and crime-infested place
Most normal
Roskilde
Full of people in Fjällraven or beige parkas with knit-hoodies, old Danish buildings, the typical city-cathedral and then just a bunch of 70-90's villas all of them about the same size, no huge outliers
The capital, Copenhagen, is so different to any other place in the country
Yeah compared to what I’ve seen from years of being on this sub, I feel like we actually don’t have that much regional and dialectal variety compared to most countries
We really exaggerate it among ourselves
If you count districts in cities, it’s most certainly [Freetown Christiania] though
Basically a hippie commune with loads of weed, concerts and farm animals dumped in the middle of Copenhagen
Not VERY foreign, but I do get a slightly "Northatlantic" feeling in Thyborøn or Hanstholm
I mean, if typical Danish cities is one of the cosy small towns on the east coast of Jutland or in the Islands, the mentioned towns will certainly stand out
Regarding the dialectal differences I’ll have to agree to some extent
Nowadays it’s slightly difficult to pinpoint where somebody is from based on the dialect given that it’s considered to be uncool to speak in dialect (at least in the younger generation)
However, I can face some trouble understanding elderly people from other parts of the country
You’re right
In a sense
Although it’s a part of the kingdom, it’s still very much a country on its own
Just like the Faroe Islands
> 20CHF
Christ, that's expensive even by *our* standards
I mean there's the fact that Berlin isn't inhabited by Germans in large part
Though true, that's also the case for cities like Hamburg or Köln
There, I'll take the blame for saying the 'mean' thing instead of the Germans
And even putting that aside, the culture with these young german leftie types in Berlin, you can't seriously deny that this is much further from traditional German culture than as you'd see it in Bayern, or even much of Eastern germany, or even just any small-medium sized town anywhere in western Germany
Maybe you don't care about that, but either way it objectively clearly is distant from it
And that's why it doesn't feel German
Danish is a very "clean" looking language similar to English, but unlike English we have the amazing letters of Æ, Ø and Å. That alone makes written Danish the obvious choice
[The trouble is that we don't say what we write]
It should be the next lingua franca just to force Swedes to speak it
that would be gold
Rødgrød med fløde
Say it say it
It shouldn’t be the next lingua franca because it is a completely irrelevant language outside of the country and Greenland
And nobody likes the way we say 97
Why danish *shouldn’t* be chosen
The grammar is simple, except for when it comes to determine wether to choose “en” or “et” as the indefinite article and “den” or “det” as the definite article
There is no rule to know this and it’s practically impossible for foreigners to know what article to choose
The only way to know what article to choose is to grow up with the language and slowly learn the right article as you learn the language
Danish would not work because people say it’s like talking with a potato in your mouth
I know it's a difficult topic and most of you write in bokmål, but - from where I stand - nynorsk just comes off so much more like what Norwegian should be, if that makes sense - bokmål is too much like Danish
I dread to imagine foreigners having to stumble through Danish pronunciations during EU Parliament debates
Kan folk ikke lide vores 97
i agree, spanish is a beautiful language
I know it’s just a joke but in what world is French a rational language
Sweden and Denmark have fought each other for centuries and hold the record for most wars fought between them
It all adds up to around 30 wars since the 15th century
They are our annoying big brother
The Å is half of the word "Nå". Learn that, and you can have entire conversations in Danish
Angel is engel :-)
[Pronunciation]
En, to, tre, fire, fem, seks, syv, otte, ni, ti
don't worry, we don't switch to 20-base before 50, lol
It has the exact same difficulty as counting in German
It's not difficult to pronounce 50-90:
Halvtreds, tres, halvfjerds, firs, halvfems
Just don't think too much about that they are 20-based
Well, we're the only Scandinavians that can spell properly, but perhaps we should pronounce written Danish in Norwegian, lol
Lol yeah guess so
syv og halvfems (seven-and-half-fives) :)
But we do start with the least significant number from 20 up to 99
Funny thing is, 40 is also called fyrretyve, even though it doesn't come from base 20
Fyrretyve actually means '4 tens". In old nordic it was  'fjórir tigir', and that developed into fyrretyve through history
Just to add a bit of extra confusion into the base 20 system everybody knows and loves :-)
And other languages can’t?
If it was Swedish, hell yeah
We would understand most of it, but not speak it ourselves
>Funny thing is, 40 is also called fyrretyve
It's funny because it looks like "four twenty" :-)
Exactly, but that is only done to fool the Germans
Since Sweden doesn't have æ or ø, why would you care where Denmark and Norway have their letters
Danish keyboards simply follow the alphabet (Æ Ø Å), so there's little reason to the change the order
It's strange that they don't use a Danish/Scandinavian keyboard in Norway, when they have the same order of Æ Ø Å in the alphabet
It's only Sweden that has a different alphabet
Yes, like I said, it makes no sense, that Norwegians don't use the Danish/Scandinavian version
*"Let's decide that Schlesweig and Holstein are Danish instead of German"* said Denmark
*"How about I kick your fucking teeth in"* said Prussia
*"I'd like to see you try"* laughed Denmark
And then Prussia kicked Denmarks teeth in
Thinking a tiny backwards country could defeat Prussia AND Austria in a war in 1864
Everything really went downhill after supporting Napoleon
Attacking Prussia in 1864
Immigration policies
I just had my lifes best orgasm
Denmark, I realy should get one of those flags
Even I agree
Then it's bad
0K to -10c : "Holy fuck it's winter
-10c to -5c : "Yay it's winter
-5c to 5c : "Motherfucking shit winter fucking winter weather
5c to 15c : "meh, as long as it's not raining it's OK
15c to 18c : "This weather is *perfect* for sleeping with the windows open
18c to 23c : "T-shirt and jeans, yay
23c to 27c : "T-shirt and shorts, yay
27c to 30c : "Why can't I spend the whole day in the kiddie pool
:("
30c+ : "Please kill me
i'd say, for me, here in Denmark
<0 = cold
0-10 = chilly
10-17 = acceptable
18-25 = ideal for me
26-30 = warm but nice
30+ = too hot
a lot of people i know, feel very different from me
especially woman, tend to be colder than me
I will take a sweater and shorts any day over T-shirt and Jeans
You're one of *those* people
I done messed that up
oopsie
You mean the sane kind
We get really depressed
A lot of people light a lot of candles
That seems to bring some warm comfort, or "hygge".
It is kind of depressing
It's only bright from 8:30-15:30 right now, and even then it's still somewhat dark
I'm at about 57 degrees north
I usually don't get winter depression, but for my girlfriend it's usually pretty rough
We bought an alarm clock that has a light that looks like the sunrise, so thqt helps a bit
Other than that, we get up early to see the sun rising and go to bed early as well
It gets dark at around 15:00 anyways
I live at 55° now which isn't as bad as the 70° back in Greenland
Adjusting to constant darkness back then could be difficult, but at least you could sleep unlike when it's daylight 24/7 in the summer
I don't know why, but I actually prefer it this way
I lived near the equator for a while and found the constant 6am to 6pm daylight slightly disturbing
Probably just too used to this
We get on with it
No, but really
It affects people very differently
I never thought much about it, because I was busy
Went to work/school and then had a lot to do in my free time
And in december the darkness is countered by warm lights and social coziness (hygge)
The first time it really started to affect me is this year, living on my own and being unemployed it all seems a lot more gloomy and limiting
We don't deal with it, more like suffer through it
The difference between a cloudy day and a sunny day for me is like going on and off antidepressant
It sucks big time, especially when there is no snow
Winter depression is s real thing that many people struggle with
..and it's been raining for a month, so chances of actual sunlight are practically nil
I've found that lots of Christmas lights help
We've hung strings of lights from the gutters, on the garage, on the flagpole, and on top of the hedges surrounding the house
Plus a few "light nets" tossed over various trees and bushes in the garden
It's nice to be able to look out of the windows rather than just see a dark reflection of yourself
Inside it's either lots of candles and getting the fire going in the fireplace, for warmth and that cozy orange light, or it's high-lumen white light to fool our reptile brains into thinking it's actually daytime
Apart from that it's all about getting outside as much as possible when it's daytime - especially if you're lucky enough to have a relatively cloudless day
We probably won't get any snow this winter (thank you global warming
) but when that happens everything gets a bit lighter from all the white snow
Finally you add a good amount of alcohol to this, and everything is either bearable, or you either flee south for a winter vacation, kill yourself due to a winter depression, or build a longboat and go looking for somewhere warmer and lighter to invade
Same
Sun rises around 9:00 and goes down around 15:30 ish
Iceland is in the "wrong" timezone
They should by geography be -1 instead they are in 0 along with UK
Basically sunrise should be 10:10 and sunset 14:32
Why the pre-viking Danes bothered to annex Jutland is a question half of the country is still asking
No, to be serious, there is actually a lot of lacking knowledge of this period, mainly whether we originated on Zealand or Scania, but regardless, we ekicked out the Herulians, who for some reason became kings in Lombardy
Don't ask me
Pre-medieval Germanic history is weird
Edit: I may be spreading fake news about the Herulians
They either came from Lombardy to Denmark or vice versa
"original Europeans" is kind of a hazy and problematic term though
Don't listen to this sneaky panda, min elskede Norge
Don't worry, I understand, but as far as I know, we can't track back to any single original people either
Indo-european people were just some of the people that migrated to Europe
Plenty came before, plenty came later
That was just what I wanted to highlight for people reading
>	Morals are not, and I mean not, in any way, arbitrary
Of course they are
For instance, Americans think eating horse meat it despicable and immoral, and have for all intents and purposes outlawed it
In other cultures - similar cultures even - it is eaten without raising an eyebrow
It's really difficult piecing that stuff together
A mixture of linguistics and archaeology can get you a long way, but in the end, a lot of it is just guess work
I will check out that theory though, see what it's about
[Brønshøj Boldklub]
No bias there, they were popular when I used to play FIFA, you would often see people using those
It’s Werner the Wasp (Hvepsen Verner)
Something like the beat to this song, named after the city I live in (Copenhagen, Denmark):
The first three minutes of this song would be the theme at midnight on a Thursday:
Danish Hygge
Trust in your fellow man
> Maybe hygge too, but the Dutch have their gezelligheid and the Germans are gemütlich, so it's not really unique
Nobody really claims it unique, it's just English-speaking media, that discovered they didn't have a direct equivalent word in English
We already have that
I find that peoples view of janteloven depends a lot on the way it's framed when they get introduced to it
What do you call entitled children/helicopter parents in your language
In Danish, we call them "Curlingbørn" and "Curlingforældre" (curling children and curling parents), because, like in curling, the parents sweep the way for their precious children in life
Do other languages have similar semi-slang terms for this
EDIT: Typo
That's funny, we also have that one in Danish: *Hønemor
>someone spelled mother as moder, father as fader and bubble as buble
Are you trying to mock my nation
Do you live near a tourist site, but you have never personally been
This always amazes me
It's right there, close to where you live
But you simply never go there
Never been
For me there is a large military musuem with tanks and artillery in my town, that I've never been to
And it's about to close actually, so don't think I'll ever get the chance now
Then there is a history museum in the next town, that people love, with like one floor being a recreation of how the city looked back in the old days, and you can explore it indoors - I've never been there either
But strangely used the library attatched to the museum many times
How about you
Yeah, i live in Copenhagen and i've never been inside Thorvaldsens museum, Amalienborg or the townhall just to mention a few
The thinking is something along the lines of "well i live here, i have plenty of time to see it some other day
". That day just never seem to come around
I live like 100 meters from the birthplace and childhome of Denmarks most famous writer, Hans Christian Andersen, and i have never stepped foot inside
I remember reading about them making it so you can only walk by it to protect it
And it makes sense, but yes I thought about going there when I went to London a few years back, but decided since you can't really get close to it anyway, you get more out of watching a documentary about it
That looks beautiful though
Thanks for sharing
I've been to the London Eye
It was rainy
We couldn't see far
And the pictures were aweful
Thorvaldsen though, is soo cool
The sculptures are breathtaking
I've been there a few times now, and exicted to go again
When I went to Istanbul oh holiday our hotel was just by the blue mosque
We went to the Asian side for like 3 hours, where we went to a shopping center, and bought some cloths
And that was it
Then we went back to the European side
So you have never been to like Galata Tower, or Hagia Sofia
Ah I love Lego though, I'd totally go
But yes, would be more fitting if it was here in Denmark
I used to hate being outdoors in general
Hated it
Then I began making walking part of my daily rutines, so instead of taking the bus, I'd leave earlier and walk for excersise
Suddenly I got hit by this walking bug
I started wearing hiking boots everyday for I never knew where my feet would take me
I explored ever street of my home town, every corner, every path
Found some hidden gems and such
If the weather is good, I'll just head out, and then call my parents to get me when I've walked towards 20kms in just a random direction
Well
That was then
I've gotten a mysterious foot injury, got it last summer
I go to specialist to specialist, and no one has any ideas what is wrong
I am right now sitting in my bed, doped on painkillers, hardly able to walk, the weather being so nice outside, and just miserable honestly
When I am done with online school in about 2 hours I'll grab my bike and go for a ride
But I don't get the same enjoyment as when I walk
Walking and hiking is special
I wish one day to be able to do it again
So walk
Explore
Those are great things to do
I lived in Orange country just outside of Los Angeles for 2 years, first thing we did, was getting year card for Disneyland
Awwwhh yisss
Was basically the best part of my years there
Going to Disneyland everyweek, upto multiple times
But since then prices has gone up, and I am not sure if we'd gone there now, we'd been able to do that
Allegedly the birthplace apparently
I went there years ago, and it was just a small house with some old furniture at that point
You're not missing much
Have you been to the HC
Andersen Museum then
I think i have been to the museum, but its years ago, when i was like 8-9
Varde Artillery museum maybe
Apparently it's moving to Oksbøl. I doubt tøjhusmuseet is going anywhere
Right next to Tivoli is Carlsberg Glyptoteket
One of my favorite places in the world
It's free one day a week, btw, and you just go in there and walk between statues and layers of history
I live almost as far from Copenhagen as I can get
But if they have a special exibition, I head there as soon as I can
Now Thorvaldsen is not far from Tivoli, but it is next to Christansborg
Litterally on the side of the goverment building
Yes Varde Artillery museum is the place
I live in Varde
Here in Denmark we count cases of beer
1 kasse øl. 2 kasser øl. 3 kasser øl. etc
1 kasse øl, to kasser øl, tre kasser øl ... and so on
It means "1 crate of beer, 2 crates of beer, three crates of beer"
Yes, this
And alternatively, but not less stereotypically, we count potatoes
1 kartoffel, 2 kartofler, 3 kartofler etc
The great thing about the word øl is that it already sounds lke drunk mumbling, so no matter how drunk you are, you are always able to ask for one more
Really
I've never heard of this one
The norwegian was is more like "thousand and one, thousand and two etc
No, no, you have to drink them
For us Danes, it really only takes one second to drink a whole case of beer
Using our flag everywhere, especially on birthdays
When I was a young child I lived in the US for a few years, and it took me a while, and only after starting in elementary school to realize that our flag wasn't "the international birthday flag" which I had thought for a while
Christmas calendar tv-shows
24 episodes a new one released every day of December leading up the Christmas eve
Well, sticking with the food theme, I think salatpizza, which is a pizza with döner kebab, iceberg, tomatoes, cucumber slices and creme fraiche dressing, is unique to Denmark, or at least  Scandinavia
I have certainly never seen them anywhere else
Otherwise, proper dark rye bread is all but impossible to find outside of Denmark
We put thin pieces of chocolate on top of our bread
>I mentioned it to them, and they seemed confused
Your Danish friend must be from Jutland
There are many fish and chip places in Copenhagen
> Ok so turns out that after talking to a Danish and German friend, fish and chip shops are not found outside of the UK
There's at least 5 in Copenhagen
The Danish flag isn't widely used Imo, usually only on birthdays & when someone dies
> and the fact that we heat up olive oil and onion in the pot before cooking rice by default
This should however be the default everywhere
sounds awesome
And there are usually several of them
Both DR ("our BBC") and TV2 tend to have one for children, and then there'll be some for older people/adults as well
Yes
In Sweden they put sugar in ryebread
And in northern germany they bake the s**t out of it
So its almost a cracker
I think NHS is pretty 1:1 with the system we have here - even down to the fact that it doesn't cover dental
Also a thing, here
We call it saftevand
Everybody knows what Ribena is
Our homegrown brand is Rynkeby, who also do a blackcurrant squash, but the most popular flavour is mixed fruits
Several other brands do cheap, chemically, sugarfree, super-concentrated squash that you mix 1:11 or something in flavours like cola, orange/raspberry, "sport", and elderflower
I'm from Sjælland and have never seen one in my life
Live in Copenhagen, but am from Jylland - I've literally never seen a fish'n'chip shop in Denmark
Plenty of restaurants sell it as part of their menu, though
There's plenty in Jylland, just gotta go to harbours to find them obviously
Is it like fastelavn
We do in Denmark every February, and I know it''s common in Austria as well
us too - as far as I know, its a left-over from being occupied during WW2
It was like a resistance kind of thing, according to my grandfather
Yes, it's used all the fucking time
I'm not sure where you're from exactly but if you're from a city then obviously fewer people will have flag poles there than in suburbs, smaller towns etc
I can take a step outside my front door and see several flags every single day here
Plenty of stores also have flags outside regardless of there being a sale or not, even those small wall mounted ones on each side of the door/window or just one of those ~2 meter wooden flag poles that you can just place wherever you want
You see the same with those little "honor system" cart thingies as well, they're usually have at least one flag on them
Plenty of companies also have the Danish flag as part of their logos
It's also used for absolutely every type of celebration
Birthday, wedding, confirmation, graduation, national holidays, town fairs etc
etc
You'll obviously see way more flags if you live in a place where the average person has a flag pole though, which isn't really the case if you live in an apartment in the middle of one of the larger towns or cities
No, I think I might have it at most once a week
And even that  pretty much just in winter
We have bad ones, but we also have great ones
Some are considered classics, and are reaired every few years
And you've got adult ones too, with a certain satire one in particular having achieved cult status
EDIT: Honestly, at least if you're already familiar with Christmas calendars as a concept, you should give the infamous *The Julekalender* a watch this Christmas - that's the cult one I mentioned
It's a riot
The Julekalender
You bake the pizza without the veggies and dressing, and add them after
Yeah - I grew up on Fyn, and been living in Copenhagen for almost a decade now
Never seen a fish & chips joint, I think
Maaaaybe at a fun fair once or twice
I did say Copenhagen
Slagelse has the best kebab though
>I've literally never seen a fish'n'chip shop in Denmark
[Chuck Bass Fish & Chips]
[Crazy Chips]
[Fish and Chips - Tivoli]
A country that puts caraway seeds in their bread has nothing to offer to this conversation ;)
Which is the company's birthday
Such a cult hit it was remade in several countries even - though I might be biased, I still say the OG danish one with De Nattergale was the best
I watch it every Christmas
German ryebread, while not over-baked, isn't as moist as Danish (also, yours taste like chocolate for some reason
I currently have a German exchange student living with me, and she had to toast our ryebread extra, because she doesn't like how mushy it is (she also didn't like how sour it is, so now she just gets German ryebread shipped to her, from her parents)
Just needed a little bit of honhonhon in there too, and - voila
Huh, I had no idea
I appreciate the trivia
Do you know which countries had those remakes, and what they're called there
I'd be pretty interested in checking them out
Norway and Finland for sure
Perhaps Sweden as well, I cant recall :)
Cheers
Denmark's treatment of Greenland hasn't exactly matched the descriptions of the small 'hyggelig' country I see other places
We did slave trade long ago
Danish West indies
Now renamed to United States Virgin Islands
and sold the islands to USA afterwards
iirc the slaves did a lot of building of houses and such in Copenhagen
i've not really read details on it
Some time after the europeans colonized, the Inuit moved in as well
We then proceeded to treat them like second or third class citizens until circa 1980
No, we're pretty fond of each other and have a good relationship
They're part of the realm community because they choose to
I haven't heard about any outright animosity towards us, at least
Actually you guys might be innocent
You think you get off easy, but most Danes don’t even know how bad Denmark was
We took more slaves than France, you guys, Spain or Portugal (can’t remember which), and the US
3rd most slaves of all Europeans, but they’re remembered for Lego
I've never heard anyone refer to a faroese person as a Dane
It's true, we consider it part of Denmark, but in the same way we consider Greenland a part of Denmark
They're in the kingdom of Denmark, but not a part of the country of Denmark
And as far as know, there has been nothing about anyone wanting out as of recently, but maybe I just haven't heard of it
Oh, I see
Still, I don't really think most Danes see the the Faroe Islands as part of Denmark the country
There might be a couple of people who don't really know how it works, but I'd say only few Danes aren't able to distinguish between Denmark the country and Denmark the Kingdom :)
We have Greenland and the Faroe Islands as well as municipalities
They are all self-governing, but the difference is that the municipalities are constitutionally self-governing, which Greenland and the Faroe Islands are not
On the other hand, Greenland and the Faroe Islands have so wide autonomy, that they basically function as small countries in local matters and are even included at some level in state affairs
The municipalities' autonomy is limited to standard municipality functions
They are still very popular in Denmark
And you can get them in any good hardware or kitchenware store
Yes
I have those
I buy every tool from Fiskar, if available
Always durable and high quality
Yup, I have three of them
Two of [these]
And then some smaller black model that I can't find on their website, I think it's meant for cutting hair
I have had them for like 20 years now and they're still working great
I also have various gardening tools made by Fiskars, great products imo
Don't know why, but those scissors reminds me of 'børnehave'(kindergarten)
The same ones
I thought they were just taking turns
It would probably cause the British to come by and bomb copenhagen again
Well there would Probably be some angry British demanding us to hand over our navy
Finally get to check in the fact we stayed with'em till the end
Pls gib Norway
I go back inside, since I only just arrived and only had four beers
Then I come back out at 3 at the earliest and go get a Döner or a pizza-slice
I go back inside, because the night is barely halfway done
The bar won't close and the beers won't stop coming for at least a few more hours
If I'm still hungry after then, I'll probably be grabbing a mix shawarma and chicken pita bread at one of the many shawarma joints that stay open all night in Copenhagen
45 is sooooo early
When you get out of class at 11:15 and start drinking right after, then it's not that early
Not one, but a row of buildings in [Nyhavn]
Perhaps the castle of Hamlet, [Kronborg] but I think it's more the story than the castle itself
Denmark
Kronborg Slot (UNESCO heritage site also featured in Hamlet)
Isn't it also like the only island in Slovenia
Not a building, but when you mentioned the Statue of Liberty, I immediately thought of this huge beast:
I haven't seen it myself, but I think it is pretty famous here in Denmark as well because of the designer
Maybe storbæltsbroen, Rosenborg or Christiansborg
From an outsider perspective, I would say the Opera House in Oslo
The Oslo Opera House is cool, but what my mind goes to when thinking about some Norwegian architecture is this:
>row of buildings with the little mermaid infront
[Like this
> that tunnel/bridge between denmark and sweden
Øresund Bridge, but we like to say it's to Scania and not Sweden
It's not a building though
Just imagine how good friends we could be if that happened
and expensive
You say that now, but we won't ever forget that time you walked over the ice
Just a head's up, biking isn't \*that\* common for everyday commuting throughout all of Europe
It's quite specific to a few countries, most notably the Netherlands and Denmark (and a few others in some specific cities)
In Denmark, bikes are incredibly varied
Some people have a lighter bike, some have a heavier one
Some prioritize baskets (mostly on women's bikes), some have a [Christiania bike] in addition to their normal bike for picking up kids or heavy groceries, while others have a [kid's seat] on the back for that
As for how you learn - mostly, you just go to some quiet roads or an empty parking lot or whatever
Parents also often bike alongside their small kids, with a hand on their back
Also we have good bike lanes
In most schools, there's a bike test when you're around 12/13 (at least it was for me)
It's not an official license, but if you don't pass, your parents will get a message saying they need to raise you better basically, lol
You get a route to bike and then some teachers will stand throughout the city to watch if you used the correct hand signals and so on
Depends on the day and the agenda
Some days I take an holder retro 26" Mountain Bike setup with modern gears, dynamo light and a rack
Alternative is a single speed track bike with fenders and a front rack
If I need to carry speciel things then a two wheeled cargo bike
I live in Denmark
I like this reply
I used to have a “station bike” for my commute (basically a bike that lives on the train station, so i could bike from the station to uni)
I obviously had an old rusty one, so the thieves would chose to steal a better bike than mine
Oh that's interesting
Here, electric bikes, except [some Christiania bikes] are by far a minority
Many see it as "cheating" lol
Oh, another thing for OP: In Denmark at least, bike theft is incredibly common
I’ve known normal people who thinks it’s perfectly acceptable to just take an unlocked bike
But bike theft can also be big organized business - my dad once locked his bike with two locks and all, still got it stolen
Criminals drive around in big trucks, cut up locks and dump them in the truck to sell
I have actually never biked one, so I don’t really know
It has a interesting history
[Christiania] was/is an abandoned military base that was taken over by hippies
They attempted to create their “perfect society” - weed, no advertisements, and of course no cars
They said the Christiania bike would be “the car of the future”.
Imo it's not that bad
However, I've only ever tried one with an electric engine on
If GTA was set in a Danish city, bike theft would definitely be an important feature
Actually those that organize bike theft in Denmark are mostly foreigners
“My bike”
“OUR bike :))”
If I’m served raw meat I ain’t gonna eat it
This definitely doesn’t apply for Europeans in general
Other than being occupied by the nazis for a few years, I think Denmark has had its sovereignty since the kingdom was founded well over a thousand years ago
In Denmark we have two periods of being free and independent
* Around 700 to 1940
* 1945 to present
Damn Nazis, they broke our streak
I was having a conversation with someone from the US who asked if we made such a big deal out of our independence day as they do theirs, and I explained that we don't have an independence day since we've never had to become independent of anyone
Acknowledging the liberation on the 5th/6th of May is barely observed anymore, and Constitution Day is also very low-key and more political than an occasion that calls for decorations or special meals
Most of Denmark was also occupied during the Second Northern War
We were mostly saved by the Dutch and the fact that Carl Gustav died in the middle of the occupation
Soon 2020
Yikes
I'm glad the person I was speaking to wasn't *that* presumptive
Yeah
Miami, but if were restricting to Europe, then i would say Palma de Mallorca
>Oslo
Why
How did the fact that Naples is the main seat of the Camorra, the Mafia of Campania, escape you
I definitly dont disagree, but I'm surprised that a Swede would be surprised by Oslo being
well Oslo
If you were at a typical student bar on a friday or saturday I dont think they would even give it a second thought
Regardless of where you were though, No one would say anything
A friend of mine did that in *Iceland*. The first and only time she did it, although she did make a great first impression as everyone thought she was super friendly and generous
Obliviously Viking age is taught throughout, and then (depending on the teacher) you might learn about Egyptian, Greek and Roman through projects through school (ages 6 to 16)
Through religion studies you might also learn a bit about ancient Jewish culture
Then, if you take STX (upper secondary school), you will have a class called Oldtidskundskab (Ancient Knowledge/Classic Studies) which focuses on Roman and Greek culture and literature
You read stuff like the Illiad, Oedipus, Platon, Aristoteles and Herodot
You also learn about vases, statues and temples and how to tell them apart (Archaic, Hellenistic and so on)
besides the vikings and proto-Scandinavian old Norse before them, there are also the oral histories of the Inuits myths from greenland
Otherwise we also know alot about how  the earliest part of the Iron Age in Scandinavia divided between the Pre-Roman Iron Age and the Roman Iron age
There are also good evidence from the Nordic Bronze Age, who had maintained trade links with Mycenaean Greece,  actively engaged in the export of amber, and imported metals in return
We learn mostly about the Ironage people (don't really have a name), the Vikings, and then the people in the medieval age
I am from Denmark
Vikings by the way are a made up concept
Really it is the end of the Ironage and the beginning of the medieval age - but they did not call them selves Vikings
This was an idea created in the 1800s due to needing a national pride after having been beaten by wars and such
So they looked back to when we were strong, and found the time where people did a viking
A viking was not something you was, but something you did
And they named this age of pillaging and attacking and raiding for the viking age
I don't know if it's depends on the teacher  as well, but the Stone Age and Bronze Age are also taught in school, primarily focusing on the periods in a Danish context
Especially the differences in the earlier hunter-gatherer society and the agrarian society
It's probably does - outside of the nature subjects, I never was taught anything about the stone age
Though I did learn about the bronze age
When I started studying history at uni, we quickly learned that what people had been taught about in school varied widely from person to person
I've met people who never even had anything about the Vikings at school
It's wild
Like in english, it's almost silent but is pronounced like in "hello"
It is pronounced as if you are going to say hose (like in a garden hose), but you come to gutteral stop before the end: "Ho-".
And no, it's not pronounced the same way as hoe
Same for Danish - and there's no similarity with how the letter a is pronounced (the vowel sound in "cat" in Danish and the vowel sound in "car" in Norwegian)
I think would visit all the European countries but if had to pick one then I would say Italy because of the current situation that are going on in Italy right now
I have visited most, and while there aren't any that I wouldn't visit, some of those that I haven't yet visited seem far out into the future considering the other countries that I also want to visit
Langtbortistan - translates to Far away istan
Where istan is like in Pakistan
I actually think it was coined by a Donald duck translator
Yes, we use "[Langbortistan] The name was invented in 1959 by Sonja Rindom, a Danish translator of Disney cartoons
The meaning is something like "Remotistan", which was used by Disney in english
Everyone knows the meaning of Langbortistan
If you mean far away, but still in the country, older people will use "where the crows turn". Or my favourite, "where the world is extended with planks".
In addition to the other Danish versions already mentioned, we sometimes say "Hvor kraverne vender" - where the crows turn around - to refer to something far away (from civilization, sometimes, but also just far away)
In Denmark, we say “Langbortistan” which translates to something like “Very far away-istan”
Not quite the same, but in Danish, when referring to somewhere really far out in the countryside, you often say it's out on "Lars Tyndskids mark", meaning "Lars Thin-shit's (Diarrhoea's) field". Alternately, somewhere can be located "hvor kragerne vender", meaning "where the crows turn around".
This guy countries
Turkmenistan for example means Land of Turkmen - Which is the Turkic group native to Turkmenistan
I used to ‘practise work’ in one of the biggest hotels in Denmark, and probably the most prestigious and expensive . I was only 13
This Day i was working in the lounge
Which meant i’d meet tourists from all over the world
On that day alone i had two occasions
1) Australian guy who travelled alone
He was in his 50’s? He really had no plans that day, but decided he wanted someone to speak with, so he went to the desk
He decided that a young man like me was perfect
He started talking with me about a movie he Saw last night, and i kindly listened to him speaking and asking for details
He didn’t remember the title of the movie
Yet we still spent 20 min speaking about that one movie, in which he remembered 0 details from
Kind man, but it was kinda strange
2) Japanese man who worked abroad this one week was very fond of me working at such an age
He wanted selfies and videos of me so he could show it to his son which were at about my age
He wanted to show his son, that people my age do work here in Denmark
He apparently found it very inspirational
Another day i was working another job in this hotel
I was put to work at the ‘meeting room’ lounges
Here, people from all around the World came to talk very important business
Some were walking in clothes that i wouldn’t even be able to afford with a years wage
They pretty much treated me like shit, and felt as if i were a peasant
I still had to be very kind towards them ;,)
Some people also were very curious of me working, so they spent their break talking to me
I Met loads of french, english, german, swedes and americans
They were all very interested in my work, and also talked about why they were in Copenhagen
All in all i had a very interesting experience with this ‘practise work’ which i did for 3 days
Met a whole lot of different people and cultures, and i also Got some great working experience
Perhaps is
It’s a requirement that Danish teens get this experience
Here in Denmark we call it ‘praktik’, which translates roughly into ‘practise’.
Is it normal that japanese people sometimes does this
Yes
He took many pictures :)
In Denmark you can legally get a part time job at 13
It is a state-led project to let students do this ‘praktik’. Though It’s the school which decides if they’ll let their students take ‘praktik’ and for how long
Some schools offer up to 2 weeks, while others don’t even participate
And yes
My parents had to sign some paperwork in order to let me go to ‘praktik’. Even the danish military offers praktik, but you need to be a minimum of 15 to attend
I’ve had a job ‘legally’ since the day i turned 13
Wouldn’t it be called an internship
It’s the same here
But you’re 13 here when you have to do it
(Atleast my class were all 13)
Idk
It was just a guess really
Idk
My bad
Ah yes
That makes a lot of sense
Thank you very much
Don’t worry man, your internship sounded very cool unlike mine who was at magasin in the Rødovre center
I chose the work myself
Ofcourse the job you want to work at needs to accept your offer and has to sign alot of paperwork
But most companies chose to accept you, cause It’s basically free labour for a few days
My uncle is the ‘boss’ at this hotel, so i Got the spot easily
I wanted to take an internship in 9th grade too, but this time at the danish military
I was too late, and still do regret never taking the internship
I mean my second internship was at Frederiksberg tailoring a quite popular tailoring place, it was cool I guess
What hotel did you work in
At a hotel in Copenhagen called ‘Radisson Blu Scandinavia Hotel’.
Quite expensive
Oh yeah I know it, that sounds so cool
It was indeed a nice experience
Nope
Yeah, you can find it in a bunch of local papers as well
It didn't?
Okay, but was it on tv
Almost certainly on TV2 news, not likely on DR I should think, maybe on TV2 in general, was watching local news that day because of the infrastructure changes so I'm not certain
Considering that it made it into a bunch of local papers, I'd be surprised if TV2 didn't run with it, but I wasn't watching
[Danish penal code § 13]
>Acts committed in self-defence are not punishable if they were necessary to resist or
avert an unlawful attack that has begun or is imminent, provided that such acts do not
manifestly exceed what is reasonable with regard to the danger inherent in the
attack, the aggressor and the importance of the interests endangered by the attack
>(2)Any person who exceeds the limits of lawful self-defence shall not be liable to punishment if his
act could reasonably be attrib-uted to the fear or excitement produced by the attack
>(3) Similar rules shall apply to acts necessary to enforce lawful orders in a lawful
manner, to carry out a lawful arrest or to prevent the escape of a prisoner or a person
committed to an institution
The short version: You can defend yourself with the same force as you're receiving
If you use more force you might avoid punishment due to you acting in fear or because you're high on adrenaline
We were discussing some time ago if we should make pepper spray legal, if that gives you an idea
It's legal to buy now now but not to carry it with you
You can use it for home defence
Well, you are *allowed* to do it :)
TIL it's not "fiese Matenten"
edit: And after reading the [German wikipedia article] I learned that there are other similar 'background stories' for *fisimatenten* and they're probably all wrong
Just gonna latch on to this comment to keep the English ones in the same place
Not sure if they have special stories but I'm fascinated by article rebracketing: *apron*, *adder*, *nickname* and *umpire* are all examples of article fuck ups
They derive from *naperon*, *nǣddre, ekename* and *nonper -* it should have been "a napron", "a nadder", "an ickname" and "a numpire" today, but enough people misallocated the "n" for the mistake to catch on and change the word
In Danish, "øgenavn" is the word for a nickname or derisive name
It comes from Norse "aukanafn", i.e. "ickname"
Because the same thing happened in Dutch, it was *nadra in Old Dutch
Well do you know what happened in 1349
I know this because of the band
Well actually people mated and produced more people indeed, but we ended up with less people due to illness
*CK2 INTENSIFIES*
Jokes aside monarchs nowdays have little to no power over such matters
I believe even through referendums it's very difficult for unification of two nations these days
you kinda have that already with Canada and UK having the same monarch
I don't think it would work in modern times since monarchs are more figureheads than rulers of the country
Not really since most, if not all, of the royal families are just symbolic, so it would have to be approved in both of the countries political establishment for anything to happen
I think the royal families actively try to avoid this because of all the shenanigans involved
And what about their child, which is heir to both countries
But their children would be the interesting point
Because they would obviously be heir to monarchies, therefore creating a personal union
It would probably work like the British Commonwealth, with the two nations still remaining separate, but would be interesting
>So is it like Scotland where they are a country but just not independent
Perhaps more like Puerto Rico
The Dutch territories are a special case, because the Dutch constitution is not supreme to the charter granting the territories their rights
>Curaçao and St
Maarten are like Canada to the UK: independent states with the same head of state
You are not an independent country, if you are part of an independent country (the Kingdom of the Netherlands)
Canada is not part of the UK but share the monarch as head of state
Usually after 18 or 19 but most people take a year or more off (sabbatår) before startining university to travel or work or both
18-19
Many do take a couple or more gap years for work and travel before going on to university
It's also quite common to go to Højskole on your Sabbatår, though some also go later in life
I think the average age of when you start uni is getting lower, though
I remember when I first started uni, there were zero people in my year below the age of 20 - personally I was 20 and I was the youngest in my year, with most being 25+. Then when I later started my second bachelor, (at 22), I was one of the oldest in my year suddenly, with most being around 18-20
Norway have 3 land borders: Sweden, Finland and Russia
None of them are NATO members, so they are not exactly surrounded by allies, but it's not like they are expecting an assault from Finland or Sweden anytime soon :-)
Conscription is also mandatory here in Denmark (only for men), but almost all spots are taken by volunteers, so it is only a very small number who is "forced in" each year - and it is only four months
Personally I would very much like to see it made entirely voluntary, like it is for women
Who do you pay to dodge it
How does that work
Copenhagen got its name in the middle ages
Kaupmannahafn is the oldest record of the current name which means Merchants' harbour
Odense (Denmark)
It comes from "Odins samt vi" which translates roughly into "Odin Together We" or "Odin's Shrine". Yes, it's also gibberish in Danish
It's said to be the city of Odin, the Norse god
Ribe, oldest town in Denmark, dating back to the 8th century
Back then it used to be called "Ripa" which is believed to come from the Latin word for riverside
TIL thx
Still "Kaupmannahöfn" in Icelandic, the language frozen in time
(And can we just use this opportunity to once again make clear that the Danish name for Copenhagen is not *Kopenhaaaagen
* What you're doing there, Mr
Worldwide, is trying to talk German
It's København in Danish - you can't pronounce it, don't worry about it, just say "Copenhagen")
You can be anything you want if you don't say Sjøpnhamn - that initial K has done nothing wrong, it just want to live its life and be respected as a K, a hard and proud sound
I mean that's probably quite close, assuming the language you're coming from is German
English-speakers can't because they lack the vowel ø/ö. There's also the presence of *stød*, which makes basically any foreign attempt to pronounce it wrong
Are you saying Danish has more *plattdüütsche* loanwords than Swedish and Norwegian
I have never noticed a difference besides the word for *window* and that is *fönster* in Swedish but *vindue* in Danisch (and I think Norwegian)
Edit: This is so great
I just looked up window in Icelandic and of course it is *gluggi* and has nothing to do with *vindue*, but there's also the word *vindauga* which basically means wind-eye
That's a lot closer to the letter Å than Ø, at least in terms of the Danish pronounciation
The v isn't lost really
It's just pronounced as a *u*. It's probably the *stød* on the preceding a that confuses you
There's a stød in *København*?
Depends on your dialect
But I say it like this  [kʰøb̥m̩ˈhɑʊ̯ˀn]
> do the spindles
Purr is called "spinde" in Danish
Same in Danish
DTU (Denmark’s Technical University)
It’s very good because everybody’s so nice and the teacher are very professional
Depends on what you wanna study, but if you wanna study business
Then, Copenhagen Business School is the place to go, not just for Denmark, but for all of Scandinavia
We've only got a few universities in little Denmark
the best are probably Aarhus university and Copenhagen university
They've got a lot of good people working there and do some great studies too
The University of Copenhagen is ranked as the highest in Denmark according to:
Depends on the degree
The Logistics & Supply-Chain Management from BSS is considered the best programme in that field in Denmark for example
In my opinion it’s the best, but it does depend on what you are studying
Aarhus, right
Yep
Aarhus is good, aswell
But as an overall institution, I think CBS is better
I used to be really scared of Nøkken as a kid - I grew up next to a bog on one side and a forest on the other, my parents would tell me about different creatures living there to entertain me and make me behave
Do you guys also have Mosekonen in Sweden
She is basically a woman who creates fog by brewing a big pot of food, which makes people get lost and walk into either the forest or rivers and bogs
She's quite closely connected to Lygtemanden and Ellerpiger, as they need her to create the fog for them to lure people, so often they work together
Even our weathermen will go "Mosenkonen brygger" if there's a thick fog coming :)
I  thought Nøkken wears a suit
At least in the Danish folklore I've heard/read he does
I've been only been able to find him either to be described wearing clothes made of fish:
"Og hvad fortæller klokken
Den er så gammel, så gammel, er der sagt, den var til, længe før mormors mormor blev født, og dog er den i alder et barn kun imod åmanden, der er en gammel, en stille, en underlig én med åleskindsbukser og skælfiskstrøje med gule åkander i, siv om håret og andemad på skægget og det er just ikke kønt
and "fancy clothes":
"though often imagined as fair and naked today, in folklore he was more frequently described as wearing more or less elegant clothing"
Also, Näcken or Nøkken actually originally comes from Nykr which means "River horse" in Old Norse
Also there's absolutely no reason why you should be rude to me like you were, simply because I've been raised with, and have read, different stories than you
You literally did not mention anything about the difference between the two - instead to ridiculed the idea that Nøkken might be wearing a suit by comparing it to saying Santa Claus might wear blue overalls - if you feel like what you did was compare the two yet say "both versions are still equally valid" I suggest rereading your messages and see how they might be read by someone, not in your mind
They come off as very rude
Road trip movies were they drive for HOURS
this country is so small
you can drive from one end to the other in a day
and almost nobody would
and if you're in the northern part and wanna go to copenhagen, you'd fly
it's like 30 minutes
Not so much due to societal structures, but more due to norms:
the whole "bad teenager having sex and/or drinking" thing in either horror movies or teen dramas doesn't really work here
It's a very acceptable thing here that teens have sex and drink - house parties are something you have with your parents knowledge, often around 16-18 before you are old enough for bars and clubs
Have a boyfriend/girlfriend and having sex with them at around 15 to 16 is more normal than not
Now imagine catholic Lord of the Rings:
"... and one ring to bind them all in darkness, and one Pope to keep the ring-owner in check
Norwegian Mad Max would be a dull movie
You'd find a way to make the Euro legal tender in space

Of course we want to imitate him
There's not really a standard dialect in Denmark
Meaning there was one, but no one really knows it or can agree on what it is, so we just speak to each other in all our different dialects
This sometimes results in two Danes not being able to understand each other
Idk, I know plenty of people my age (20s)that still speak thybomål or sønderjysk, who are able to turn it on and off
No, I don't think I've ever heard anyone be asked to speak clearly either
Though I think that's because they already automatically switch from the dialects, without being asked
Like my bf speaks thybomål with her family, but regular danish with me, since I don't know all the words of thybomål
I thought that was Vendelbo
Yeah, I used to switch all the time when I lived in Copenhagen
Especially because if I didn't, people would repeat what I was saying back at me in "my accent" and laugh
Both my grandparents spoke thybomål, so I do understand a lot of it when spoken, but can't speak or understand all of it
Yeah, I'm from Kronjylland, so my accent it pretty well-known, though we do have words and terms that are unique to us, plus I do use for thybomål and vestjysk expressions in my everyday language, but people zeroed in on it straight away, and all thought it was hilarious
I'm just glad (though also quite annoyed), I'm female, so at least for me it was mostly something people thought was "cute" or "attractive", whereas my male friends were often told they sounded "aggressive" or "unintelligent"
I was born and raised in Midtjylland, but my dads parents had lived all of their lives on Langeland
When I was a kid back in the 80's and early 90's and we visited them, I had a really hard time understanding anything
I would usually look to my dad, and he would try to discreetly nod or shake his head, to let me know how to respond
They both died in the mid 90's, and I never got to spend a lot of time with them, since we usually only visited a few days during the summer
I would love to have had a recording of them, both for my personal memories, but also to have saved their dialect, since it is almost gone
My dad (who is 82) can't really speak the dialect anymore, only a few odd words
I remember it being much more unintelligible than this:
Kimse is a great word, up there with grat and makværk
I use them all regularly
Honestly, from living in Copenhagen for 10 years, my experience is that many Copenhageners think of their dialect as "standard Danish" and 100% subscribe to elitist bullcrap, even when they claim to be left wing
Why do you think the most shit on cities and areas in Denmark, are the areas that are mostly working class, and are shit on due to stuff associated with stereotypes about the working class
Elitism is thriving
I know the feeling
My granddad from my mums side is from Als and speak a very heavy Alsisk, and I just have never understood it
So as a kid I always had to sort of either look at (or ask) my parents, or pick out words and hope I got the gist of what he was saying  thank god for youtube being able to help us disporia kids expirence some nostalgia and hopefully get better at understanding
I'm surprised though, I probably got maybe 90-95% of what the woman was saying, and I've never been to Langeland
Currency
I'm strongly in favor of everyone using Euros
But many rules are specialised for different places, and so it would make no sense to universalise them
In Denmark, for example, it is a law requirement to always have car lights on
This is because it’s so often overclouded and dark even when it’s summer, so by law, it’s far safer if they’re always on
In Spain though, this would be a tremendous waste of electricity
I think the first step would just be to implement it everywhere
Tons of countries don't have proper bottle and can return systems
But how will this be implemented
Will we force companies to only pay at a certain cap even though they might be willing to pay more for local skilled labour
And if so, what is stopping the companies from giving non-cash benefits instead
well the minimum wage in poland has increased over the past years
maybe we see that happening in romania and ukraine now
could take a while though
>The only state I know of getting around this rule even though they are eligible for the currency is Denmark
And the UK
It is because we have the euro opt-out, so we are not required to adopt the Euro
> The only state I know of getting around this rule even though they are eligible for the currency is Denmark
I think the UK as well, iirc
You're obligated to adopt the Euro once you meet certain conditions
It's called the [convergence criteria] The EU does care (kinda), it's just your country hasn't meet the criteria
Even if you do, you can pull a Sweden and just kinda not adopt the Euro
That's why you have to meet the [Convergence criteria] first
I'm not saying everyone over night should use the Euro just like that
Just that everyone (eventually) using Euros would be a good thing
You are legally obliged to join Schengen
[But you haven't lived up to the conditions set forth in the past] So it's not like the EU doesn't want to let you join Schengen it seems like they won't because they believe there isn't enough  anti-corruption measures
However, there was [a vote in Dec
2018] where the European Parliament decided to let Romania into the Schengen zone
Ahh I see
I misunderstood your comment
I thought you meant it as something to be enforced, but you meant it as something that would be optimal
> when it's very convenient for western EU gov'ts to score political points by acting tough on the Schengen issue
I completely agree
It's never as simple as 'yes you meet the requirements of course you can join

Raisin buns or chocolate buns
There were a song comparing those preferring raisin to Hitler
"Krebinetter" or "karbonader".
Literally the same thing (a crunchy meatball), but the name is the most significant cultural divide of Denmark
that song is correct
raisins in buns are a disgrace and should be thrown into the øresund
There aren't two camps on that subject
There are those who are wrong, and those who eat chocolate buns
raisins are underrated

I was literally thinking about this 'war' this morning, as I was buttering my knækbrød. As I'd put it on my plate, I'd accidentally put it cavity-side up, and I thought: "anyone who butters the cavity side is idiots
It's like that thing in Sweden with the debate on which side".
Why not both

Boo, hiss
no there are two types of buns with small brown bits in denmark: raisin buns and chocolate buns
raisin buns trick you into thinking that it's chocolate, but leaves you with a foul surprise

Rasmus Paludan, obviously
He formed his own party called stram kurs
He’s been hosting “demonstrations” where he goes around Copenhagen and burns the Quran
He’s recently been banned from doing this, mostly for his own safety, since the threat of someone attacking him has been quite high recently
> where he goes around Copenhagen
Mostly in Copenhagen, yes
but he actually have demonstrations in all parts of Denmark - as long as it's got a so called "Ghetto" with lots of muslims
he does it only to provoke
>he does it only to provoke
Disagreed, he does it to demonstrate how muslims act when faced with disagreeing opinions and how they tend to use violence as a measure to stop people from voicing these opinions
Sure I don't agree with his opinions, but it's damn smart and almost worked
Doesn’t he do it mostly in nørrebro
And there’s also those stories where he goes and visits schools and gymnasiums
Never thought about like that, but that’s still kind of messed up
Definitely messed up

I think it depends on consciously using primarily the Latin derived words whenever it's possible
I think Finland Swedish is one of the easiest Swedish accents
It's very pronounced
The hardest is probably Dalarna
What the fuck are they saying
Finlandssvensk is one of the more easy variants of Swedish in my opinion
I understand the majority, but I also know the story well
I have to carry some form of legitimate photo ID (usually a passport) which *will* be checked if I want to travel to other parts of my own country, so maybe not as smooth as most places
You can just drive over the border using the small roads
They're not controlled at all
In Danmark Dansk Folkeparti had been waiting for a reason to implement border control
The migrant crisis was that reason
They don't think a country without border control is a real country (I guess)
It costs us a shitload of money and doesn't really do anything
The mostly stop cars that are loaded to heavy
> you know, “drugs” could happen
Where did you hear that
Every party in favor of the border control takes great pride in the fact that they do it to keep out those pesky muslims
>10m high
I dont think its 10m, but officilly its for boars (which can carry disease, specificlly  hoot-and-Mouth Disease which we dont have in Denmark, and we have a significant pork industrty, so getting it would be very bad), it will have holes in it anyway for smaller wildlife, so its not like it will stop anything
Don't give them any good ideas
Our "temporary border control" will getting extended indefinitely
In fact, we just put up "temporary border control" against sweden too
I think you're having us confused with the US
It is a 1,5m boar fence
Not that there isn't plenty of other stupid shit going on at the border these days, though
The fence isn't going across roads
Also; it's not very tall
You could just jump over it
The pork flu in China has been great for Danish export
I kinda get wanting to protect it
Yeah, but it was downgraded to the boar fence
We arent ready to defend ourselves and you arent ready to invade us
Jump ~ Climb over
That's just my choice of words bring imprecise
I would probably be able to climb over the fence without much trouble
> It's just a lame excuse for your government to get around current treaties
*Former* government that needed the support of a right wing party, but yes
[Desktop and Laptop]
Both are just some i found on google
I like calm wallpapers
A guy who looks like he smoked 300 lbs of meth and has been trying to tan for days is what my desktop wallpaper is
Flanders and Wallonia, no government but somehow still functioning, Bruxelles, waffles
slow ass political decisions that lead to nothing
Beer, fries and EU-institutions
Chocolate, Vlaanderen, Wallonia, Club Brugge, Moleenbeek, Bruxelles, King Leopard and his actions in Africa
Germany, but french
Peeing kid
Tintin, Congo, ridiculous country that should just be split between Nehterlands and France
i was mostly referring to the EU parliament :)
but then i guess Belgium and Denmark has got more in common than just beer enthusiasm
It’s in our blood to joke about Sweden
Sweden, frick them
Sweden and greenland
Sweden, Norway and Jutland
Oh yeah
As is tradition
Jokes on you
We dont have submarines
Says the country that has multiple times been under Danish rule  We might be retarded, but what does that make you
Why are you using American numbers
They did marginally vote no in 1972 at the same time that Denmark marginally voted yes
Yes there is a European Movement Norway branch
The Danish expression for cringy, be it on your own or someone else's behalf, is tåkrummende
Literally *toe curving*.
And, is it true that *pus* means kiss
> Basarabia, pământ românesc
Example
The lazy people just use a stencil saying "BASARABIA E ROMANIA"
Moldovans are almost as uncommon on this sub as Belarusians
Prut doesn't have a dual meaning in Swedish
In Danish it is related to both farting and haggling
Same in Danish
And it also means farting
Yeah
When I lived Copenhagen
Depends on where you walk
I've had my wallet stolen once at a station near Nørrebro, though the guy did give it back to me when I asked
As a woman there are also areas I avoid walking alone if I can help it
Though generally I'm not scared at all
I recently moved back to my hometown Randers (Denmarks 6th biggest city) and here I feel very safe no matter where in town I am
Don't think I've ever seen or heard about anything happen to anyone
Copenhagen
On a weekday completely walkable
On friday and saturday nights i would stay away from the northern parts
Copenhagen is generally pretty safe, I avoid Thorsgade, Istedgade and Nordvest and the only time anything bad has happened was a catcall from two boys sitting on a bench
Three girls who had been talking to them from behind then slapped them on the back of the head and told them off
Copenhagen
As a guy i have never felt scared walking in the middle of the night, but I do know that some of my girl friends have to follow each other to the closest spot for each of them out of fear
I do not live in a city or town just on a farm, which makes it walkable at no night but there is nothing to see out here in west Jutland
Same in all of Danmark
Do right-wing extremists attack random women
I think I just baffled him so much by asking for it back quite sternly
I'm a 162cm woman who was on my own in an empty station, so I don't think I scared him tbh
He just sort of spun a tale about how "he found it on the ground and was going to give it to me", but 5 seconds before he had literally knocked into me and I felt him take it out of my pocket since my hand was in the pocket as well
I don't know what happened in my head, but I just got really angry and spoke to him like I used to speak to the kids I used to babysit
Apparently that worked
Probably a really stupid thing to do in general though, and I don't recommend it to anyone
Many young men who are out of pedagogical reach
The North-West has many MENA immigrants
Don't go there with a MAGA cap, far right symbols in general or look Jewish
Women in very short skirts could also get unwanted attention/comments from MENA immigrants
Also Outer Nørrebro is worse than Inner Nørrebro
I've seen a guy with a kippah in Silvan at Nørrebro station, so take the "don't look Jewish" with a grain of salt
I would like to think I don't take up that much space that people can't avoid knocking into me in stations, but perhaps I have a warped self-image  I knew I shouldn't have gotten my mirror from the Tivoli Fun-House
Here is a [Wikipedia page] about it, but as it also says there are no clear borders nor any official demarcation
It's not super bad compared to other countries, but it still stand out in a Danish perspective
Nørrebro is also in common language divided between Inner Nørrebro, which is "hip", and Outer Nørrebro which is part of the "North-West" and not so hip
DTU (Lyngby) is way North of this and is not even in Copenhagen Municipality
When I say *way North,* Lyngby is actually only 20 min or so from Copenhagen Central station with the city train
Ah that's it
He was too shy to ask for my name, so he wanted to look at my ID instead
Subjective of course but I would say first city to get bombarded with missiles ever
Copenhagen
When it partially burnt down because of political tension
RAF bombed by request of the Danish resistance the dorms at the University of Aarhus in 1944 because Gestapo had their local headquarter there
75 people died
Also, the first and so far only school shooting happened at the university in 1994, where a man shot at women specifically and killed two before he shot himself
Varde, Denmark
Quite small town, but because of our river, we have been a kinda "Trading Capital" in Denmark
The city has burned down, to dirt and ash 3 times
This is the reason why we had the best firestation in the country, and the town is old, but the buildings are new
The arrival of the Railway, and the establishment of the radio factory
Probably a couple of high school students who in 1971 created the first Roskilde Festival, which today is the second largest rock music festival in Europe
Before that probably the protestant reformation in 1536, which removed Roskilde's status as the largest and most important city in Denmark
The cathedral continued to be the preferred location for the entombment of the Danish monarchs, but apart from that most of the other religious institutions disappeared, churches and monasteries were torn down etc
The Danish nobility also got anxious and disposed him, because what were to stop that madlad from doing it to them too
Sweden stab stab
Which city
I know that the museum Rungstedlund is dedicated to the preservation of Karen Blixen's home and some of her art
But I don't think they have a monopoly on her literary work
Edit: as it is pointed out in a comment in this thread, they do in fact have the rights to her work
Koda & Gramex for music, and Copydan ( for other creative works
Though design patents for applied art ( such as designer furniture, kitchen equipment, tableware)  are valued highly, and has significant cultural importance
They also seem to own the rights to her work
In 2032 they become free to use for all
In Denmark, an authors copyrights expire 70 years after their death
That is also why nobody owns the rights to H.C. Andersens original fairytales today, but publishers can have rights to "modern translations".
Gift in Danish means both married and poison
I have one for Polish and Danish
Tak is thanks in danish and yes in polish
slut, fart and gift apply to danish as well
Stay away from the cycling lanes, if you come to Denmark (unless you are riding a bike)
I can't say much that hasn't already been said by other comments, but I can add that a good idea is to research the countries you'll be visiting - especially in regards to social expectations
for example, here in the north openly talking to strangers and/or otherwise being loud will be seen quite negatively, and will *not* make you popular
I believe there is also something in France about saying "hello"/"goodbye" when entering and exiting shops
Just don't be pushy and have respect for the culture and generally everything
And as always, be polite
Don't randomly talk to people in public or take the seat next to theirs
Respect the local values
I forgot to mention this
Me neither
What does it mean
Is it about how loud one should be talking
Don't they say half past three
That's what I remember learning
If you don't mind, when has anything good ever come out of somebody losing their temper
I mean, as a Nordic the cheek kiss is absolutely horrifying
If that's the case, explain how i'm able to eat food right now
Close enough
Depending on the part of Copenhagen that you want to live in, you can either get an about 45 sqm apartment, or about 100 sqm near the outer edges of the capitol area
Move an hour or so out of Copenhagen(in the right direction), and you can get 240 sqm
In Copenhagen I would say Nyhavn
Not so much going to the area, that I always recommend, but eating there
It's expensive and you can easily find better not that far away
That being said, you of course pay for the privilege of eating at Nyhavn mostly, so if you are willing to do that, fair enough
Also, the Little Mermaid is basically a joke among Danes by now
Every tourist has to see it, and every tourist will be disappointed
In my hometown Randers, we only really have two tourist places
An indoor rainforest, which is totally worth the money
And an Elvis museum which is build to look like his home in Memphis, which is expensive and not worth the money
Legoland in Billund, Denmark
Expensive as heck, rides are half assed
Honestly only good part of it is going to the mini world and seeing all the small lego houses, but even so, the price is way to expensive for what you get
Food is not great either
Yet
With all this said, I go about once or twice a year
Because honestly, we don't have a lot of other things around, and friends visiting from other countries really want to see it
You still get a fine day
It's always a bit pretending to have fun
In my childhood it was the greatest thing ever, but I've been in load of parks now that does theme parking way better
Like Disneyland
But to be fair, I haven't really been in that many other Danish parks, so can't even tell you which one you should rather go to
I would add Strøget, the pedestrian street off the Town Hall Square
I don't know how much of a unique concept it is anymore now that more towns and cities are being pedestrianised and efforts are being made to cut down on motor traffic
Decades ago, that was what it was famous for, but now, meh
All the shops and restaurants on that street are either huge international chains or tacky, expensive souvenir shops
It's a major thoroughfare for people trying to get to other places, so it's often very busy with tourists (well, normally) and locals alike
If you want to find people getting scammed by Three-card Monte games, random vendors selling worthless plastic toys, pickpockets, the occasional beggar, and/or awful street performers, definitely head for Strøget
I'd highly recommend walking down one of the streets that run more or less parallel to Strøget, a block or two out, instead
Or just turn a few corners and see what's there: that part of super central Cph is crammed with all sorts of bars, restaurants, cafés, independent stores, offices, music venues, hotels, churches, cool timber-framed houses, regular peoples' private residences, and even schools and university buildings, so it's not like a CBD where you *only* find boring office blocks with a few chain coffee shops dotted around
Randers Rainforest is defo worth a visit
Once got season tickets for my daughter and me as a xmas present; she loved going like every 4-8 weeks
Fårup and Djurs Sommerland are both pretty good
Depends on the day
Sometimes there are so many tourist around it that you can't get anywhere near it without spending time standing in line
It certainly isn't a thing that you should prioritise seeing, it took me several years of living in Copenhagen to see it
It's kinda like seeing the Sherlock Holmes statue in London
It's nice, do it if you are nearby, but otherwise don't bother
The Little Mermaid statue is kinda a joke by now in Denmark
It's small, faraway, and quite simple
I mean, it's a nice statue, but the area surrounding it has more value than the statue
Hell, there's even better statues [just around the corner ]
Agreed
My grandfather used to take me and my brother twice a year, and we both loved it every time
I still always take friends from out-of-town whenever they visit the city
Such an interesting concept
Honestly it's just a weird rich guy who decided to build a 3,5 million euro museum for all the stuff he collected about Elvis throughout his life
The cafe is supposed to be good, though a bit gross since it sells all of Elvis' favourite foods
I haven't heard about that, but it's lost its head a couple of times, as well as its arms and been painting red and stuff
But it one in public is a copy of the original one anyway, so it isn't really that much of an issue, the real one is in possession of the heirs to the guy who made it in some secret location
Rundetårn I like - it's a good way to see the city, plus the building is interesting
In general a lot of the touristy places in Copenhagen (Amalienborg, Marmorkirken, Tivoli, Christiania) are all worth their salt, especially is the weather is nice
Well, you sort of hit a sore point about Randers
It's not really crime ridden or a shit hole (in fact most statistics says crime here is among the lowest in Denmark), but it's generally stereotyped to be filled with uncultured, aggressive and violent people - both as a joke and because people honestly believe so
As it is, most of that is due to it being a mostly working class city, which carries with it a lot of prejudices
As a local who takes public transport from CPH Central Station all the time, I still find it kind of a trip to be able to see the rollercoasters and other rides peeking over the wall and hear people shrieking while I'm just standing around waiting for a bus
Having a full amusement park right smack in the centre of town is really quite strange
Depends - I know plenty of areas in Copenhagen that's basically half the price of Nyhavn with higher quality of food and service, but if you eat near Strøget, Kongen Nytorv (though there are some cheaper places near KN), Tivoli and similar, you eat in the places tourist do, so it's more expensive
If you are able to find the non-touristy spots it's still more expensive that the rest of Denmark, but it's less so than Nyhavn and the likes
True - I have only visited München once to go to the Oktoberfest, and I had a blast
We were a weird bunch of people who all met through couchsurfing
org and a local guy who I think was sort of famous (a tv-host or something)
He got us a big table in one of the halls and we all learned a lot of German drinking songs
We had people from the US
, Argentina, Egypt, The Philippines, England, Italy, Slovakia and myself from Denmark at the table
Yeah, just wasnt bothered to pay for the food there
I always made a nice lunch for us from home to eat there - i live almost an hour up north, but my sister lives out in stevnstrup so always combined the rainforest with a visit to her and her family
(Nice free dinner haha)
I think most people in my generation picked up on the stereotype with the mokai and scooter memes that were viral 6-7 years ago on facebook
I mean, I can't really think of any major city in Denmark that isn't primarily working class
Herning, Aalborg, Esbjerg, all known for industry and work, but doesn't have the same stereotype
I like going there for a walk, at least
It's lovely when the weather is nice
Great idea
I grew up in Hornbæk, just on the edge of town, so we just always either ate at home, or at my grandparents' home since they lived in Dronningborg
Now that I'm an adult, when I go I always take my friends to Cafe Jens Otto after, since it's my favourite place in town (cheap, good food and amazingly hygge decor)
I imagine the food in Regnskoven is very expensive and not really worth it though, so it's good that they allow packed lunch
My dad had the stereotypes about him as well in the 70s and 80s, and when my mum moved here in the 90s she knew about them as well  like the Randers meme thing was just the new evolution of it
I mean, I've experienced it my whole life and I'm in my late 20s now
Also, Herning, Aalborg and Esbjerg did used to have the same stereotypes about them, the Randers ones just became persistent due to a meriad of things, like comedians mostly using Randers as the basis for their "stupid/violent/poor people" jokes, the meme page, that video that became popular in early the noughties, and so on
Oh, yeah, nothing against it at all, it's just odd/unusual when you stop and consider it
Ohmy, i have been at cafe jens otto with my sister
She had their æggekage and i had the stjerneskud iirc, great place, great food, great servers
To care about insignificant details in Danish is called Flueknepperi, translated to fucking flies
In Danish they're mariehøner, Mary hens
Maybe someone else knows why we brought chickens into it, but I don't.
we just write in english, unless it's on the country subs
getting it automatically translated would likely give some strange results
english is fine
but MOST posts and memes on /r/denmark are in danish
i've not seen complaints when someone asks a question, or comments, in english though :)
I use English
Writes in English and most also talks in English online
Looking at the grammar used when American teens text each other, i'd go as far as to say that a lot of European countries probably have a better grasp of English grammar than Americans do
Nope hahah would be pretty if I’d just be spitting out danish words expecting some kind of translation
Nej, som du kan se her, bliver de ikke oversat automatisk
Men gid de gjorde - mit engelske er en smule rustent
Other than by screaming and running over each other with autocampers
well, the wording _is_ a bit off
I'd say it would be:
"vi skriver bare på engelsk, medmindre det er på landesubs'ne/landenes subs
at få det automatisk oversat ville nok give nogle sære resultater"
Vi sittar her i ventaen og spillar lita DOTA
That sounds ridiculous
can someone explain what that sub is about
I've looked at it and am pretty confused
Are you sure you are not Austrian
Looks like an Austrian version of r/dankmark or r/DANMAG
could tell
well to be fair danish is fairly close to english so its easier to translate 1 to 1
yep, waay better
if you translate entire pages I would recommend the google translate addon for chrome; it makes things a lot easier
what has my comment lead to
mobile translate has the option to translate from a picture, which has saved me a countless amount of times
I think I'm a bit lost at what you mean
nope, it's part of the google translate app on ios/android
you can either scan or choose a picture, which is super neat
We use the word “stueetage” for the ground floor and call the floor above that 1st floor
As a software developer I'm happy to report that we use Zero indexed floors in Denmark
First floor is the one above ground floor
We do it the same way too
Out of all the things they get wrong, I have to give it to the Americans on this one
The first floor you walk into is, well, the first floor
“Stuen” is street level or ground floor
First floor is the one above it
If you translate *Erste Obergeschoss* literally into English, does it not mean something like *first overfloor*? That seems like a nice way to make sense of them: Floor, overfloor, underfloor
"Stueetage" meaning living room floor
Not the answer you're looking for, but *my* literal translation of Obergeschoss would be *over-bullet*, and I have no idea why it's called *Geschoss*
Wait, you guys really say *Geschoß*??? It rhymes with *Moos*?
The pH scale here in denmark
Nothing is Scandinavian
We are no better than our ~~african~~ viking ancestors
Well it depends
Administratively Denmark is divided in to five regions with pretty boring names, North Jutland, Middle Jutland, South Denmark, Sealand, and the capital Region
However on a more local level areas seems to have more interesting  names such as Crown Jutland, Vendsyssel, Djurs and Hanherred
We have a lot of funny city names as well
Most foreginers notice **Middelfart** and **Lolland**, but some are also funny in Danish such as **Sæd** (semen), **Lem** (penis), **Tarm** (intestine), **Røved** (ass oath) and **Helved** (hell)
We got a place called "sæd"
which means cum
We also got Ølsted
which means "Beer location"
And "Røved" which means "ass oath"
well, depending on how you translate them
edit: And Pikhede
Pik = Cock
Hede = moor
In Denmark there the 5 administrative regions Northern Jutland, Central jutland, Southern Denmark, Zealand and the Capital Area
Bonus: We have the football clubs FC Central Jutland, FC Northern Zealand, Soutern Jutland Elite sport and we used to have FC Western Zealand
And don't forget Høm (poop)
In Danish it means small butt cheek
We don't. But just as in German you can put random words together to make a new one
Non of the cities are named after these things
Their old names just happen o be the same as these words
Cool
It will be interesting to see what happens next
Namme namme, pepperonipizza med drille ️
(Nom nom, pepperoni pizza with dressing)
Garlic sauce is pretty common, and kebab sauce with kebab pizza
Swedes have truly perfected the art of how to ruin a pizza
Ketchup for fries
We have mayo for that tho
Nope
Not gonna try banana curry pizza either
Pros: high standard of living, liberal culture, little to no corruption in politics, very little inequality
Cons: living in the countryside is depressing as shit, and it's an overall inconvenient country (stores close early, no uber, taxis are expensive as fuck, it takes 2 weeks for your package to arrive if you ordered online) and the weather
Pris: healthcare & free education to name a few
Cons: high tax, but it's worth it
Another con: Malmö
And the country is one giant field and it smells like pig shit
Most stores close either around 19, or even 20 or 21 (grocery stores even later), I honestly don't think that's too late
Who did you get to deliver Post Nord
Because I've never heard of anyone having to wait that long unless it was Post Nord or a Wish package
It's mostly the rain and darkness I dont like
If it was 10 degrees and sunny all the time I wouldn't mind it
I was mostly referring to Post Nord
Okay, makes sense then
An angelmaker (englemager) in Danish is a person who kills small children and infants for profit
The most famous one took orphans in and was paid by the government to take care of them, but killed a lot of them and kept collecting the money
Another example could be for insurance
Not sure if it counts as patriotic but born in the usa
I learned "Tomorrow belongs to me" once when I was in a local production of Cabaret
It's a beautiful song, but sadly was very popular with neo groups soon after it was published
I've had to stop myself from humming it in public a couple of times
I always liked Swedens national anthem "Du gamla, Du fria"... And I'm Danish
"Ja, jag vill leva jag vill dö i Norden
Can relate
I really like your point of view, i respect all the other answers but yours really made me think
I think i speak for a lot of Europe, please vote in November
Honestly, i wish you the best and please get that clown out
I would love to see the day that a progressive Turkey throws away Erdoğan and joins the EU
I'm actially sort of interested to hear this: What is the prevailling view of Atatürk in Turkey at the moment
I live in a community with a lot of Turkish immigrants, and eventhough they mostly support Erdoğan, it seems they are still very fond of Atatürk
It seems a bit paradoxical
I really love Turkey, Turkish music and Turkish history, but I haven't talked to a non immigrant about the current views in Turkey
> But this doesn't mean they're not Europeans, right
This just means antisemitism was widely spread in Europe for a loooong time
I think an important addition here is that, while the Jews were not perceived as being local by most locals, many Jews did view themselves as European
So Jews in Germany often viewed themselves as German, even if others didn't see them that way
> But I don't think you can't be European just because you belong to a specific religion
That's a whole big can of worms
Part of the issue is that the whole premise of "religion" here is essentially an early-modern, Western Protestant construct
Tom Holland covers this in his book Dominion, but "Judaism" as separated from "the Jewish race" weren't separate concepts until the last few centuries
Until then, the two were integrally connected
It was only when modernising, centralising states began forcing the Jews to register their religion as an isolated thing on censuses that the idea of a dichotomy between Jewish ethnicity and religion arose
Yeah, that's what I've heard of the German Turks, it seems to be sort of the same here, but a little more progressive, perhaps because we have a lot of Kurds as well
The fire on the ferry Scandinavian Star, april 7
1990
Sailing from Frederikshavn (Denmark) to Oslo (Norway)
159 dead
Tragic on it’s own, but the real mystery is what actually happened that night
It’s still being debated/discussed in public and media 30 years later
The reason being that it might have been arson and that would make the arsonist Scandinavias worst serial killer, who has never been caught
It’s grown into a lot of conspiracy theories as to why it happened and investigation has been difficult and riddled with flaws because of the Norwegian, Swedish and Danish authorities not being able to work together
A lot of different theories exists and earlier this year a new 6 piece documentary (by Danish national tv DR, Norwegian NRK and Swedish TV4 Sverige) aired and sparked new interest in the mystery
On May 9th 2020, the documentary led to a majority of the Danish parliament voting to initiate a government hearing
Among the questions are: what is the status of the case and what is being done to achieve closure
At the harland & wolff, yes
Medisterpølse I guess
Good medister can only be bought during Christmas time and that shit is fucking amazing
Rest is just meh compared
A Danish pastry in Denmark
Sure we'll have some Wienerbrød as we call it if you're like having a coffee with friends
But I see a lot of people outside Denmark think it is like breakfast or something like that
But, we usually eat fairly healthy breakfasts like oats or yogurt, maybe open faced sandwiches
Been a while since I had Wienerbrød. Maybe I should go get some later
In Denmark it is Danishes duh, it wasn’t even invented by Danes it was invented by some bakers in Vienna Austria
But they do taste good
I was also thinking Rød Grød med Fløde
I've honestly never tried it nor ever even had the option of trying it
Medister my parents used to make when I was a kid in the 90s, though I never liked it
Seems to have gone a bit out of fashion though
Oh shit yeah, completely slipped my mind
In Denmark you may not fly the Danish flag after sundown, as that would mean you fly it for Satan
High taxes
I have read this comment several times over and still have no idea what you are trying to say
What's the point you are trying to make here
You are talking about a "mentality" and a "stance" without ever mentioning what those are or involve
Wait, the faroese limit is 300DKK
The Danish limit is 80DKK :(
You also have Oostvaardersplassen, which is a really important and interesting area
There was even a movie about it
Only downside with that place is the animal welfare activists
What's surprising is the extreme lack of empathy, or even just viewing women as *people*. You talk to women the same way you talk to men: as people
Within EU there's no limit, but it does make it annoying when ordering bigger things from outside the EU
Most sellers are quite flexible regarding what they write on the invoice though, if you ask nicely
No, it's a globally important case study in ecological restoration
It is also a very important in the Western-European nature, being responsible for the recovery of, among other species, grey goose, white-tailed eagles and spoonbills
Oostvaardersplassen was particularly important in the case of the latter species, since it served as a springboard for them to recolonise much of western Europe
The current Danish population descends from Oostvaardersplassen
Pretty much
Postnord charges 150kr for their toll "service", so you're paying VAT on the value of what you ordered, then VAT for the shipping, then tax on the combined amount if you're ordering something that's worth more than 900-1000kr
And then the service fee on top of that
You can in theory do the toll/tax/VAT thing yourself, but I don't know anybody that does that
At least in Denmark you can do the declaration and payment yourself, provided you're up for filling out a form correctly(looks somewhat challenging), calculate the correct tax and VAT, and then taking it to the SKAT office and paying it there
Then you can show up at your local Postnord place that has your package, and in principle get it from them after showing them the papers
I'm not entirely sure on the process though
Should be cheaper, but more time-consuming
Couldn't you basically collect/send all the parts to someone in Denmark, and then have them ship a combined box to you
I'd say maybe Aalborg or Aarhus
Aarhus less so because towns nearby have so called 'rivalries' with the town and will shittalk it for days if you allow it - while still liking the city and preferring it over, say, Copenhagen or Odense
Aalborg is more harmless but many also describe it as a bit boring
Aarhus has the edge there of being a more exciting place to visit
Nobody really dislikes Fyn (region)
I was also considering the Island of Bornholm
Always in English
At our company we are also a mix of a lot of different nationalities so English is the lingua franca anyways
Good code is not just effecient code, it's also the comments, naming, documentation, etc
i.e. maintainable
But
When you turn up at a customer with 30+ years of legacy code you risk seeing things that is baaaad
I've seen code written in danish, with danish documentation, danish code comments
and with danish variable names including æøå. The customer wanted their new project to adhere to those decades old standards because their company language was danish
That basically ment they could only use danish developers for even the most mundane tasks (and of course they couldn't understand why their outshoring efforts were going so badly)
Always English
Years ago because Æ, Ø and Å in the code used to break something somewhere
Today mostly because there almost always will be someone not speaking Danish involved at some point
Many years ago I worked together with German developers
The product was available in multiple languages
But when it suddenly stopped speaking English to you and error messages in German appeared you knew that you had triggered a severe bug
When they set up shop in Denmark it was a shit feast
Products broke the law with misleading naming and/or imagery - like their strawberry cake without strawberries, and their employee treatment and management methods got the unions to bite their asses *hard*. Then, over the first year or two they got their shit together, and have become one of the better places to work (for supermarkets) and seem to have found their niche with as a discount brand with decent quality and in-house "bake it the last bit of the way" bakeries, that will happily make you eight fresh pretzels if you ask for it
I'll happily shop in a Danish Lidl when I come across one
It used to be a typical German discount store
But now it's really good
Lots of organic products and very cheap
In Denmark its a pretty low discount market, like Aldi or something
Lidl is slightly better than a couple of the other discount supermarkets
it's better than aldi for example
aldi here in Denmark is utter shit
IMO the big problem is that they got so much weird and private-label products
i cant go and find "the thing" i get buy in almost all other supermarkets (there's some exceptions of course) because they mostly got private label stuff and a lot of obscure german brands
meanwhile all other danish supermarkets have a lot of the same stuff, which makes it easy
i can walk into any supermarket, almost regardless of which one it is, and find the same products
i like that
Of course, i dont always buy "name-brand" things but for some things, thats what i do
it doesnt matter with toilet paper or dish soap for me
but it does for cheese, juice, milk and such
and my gf and kid likes certain brands of bread
I much prefer Rema1000 over Lidl, here in Denmark
And then we'll just ignore the bigger stores such as Bilka, Føtex, kvickly or whatever
and Salling Super is completely out of Lidls league
For saaaaan
Lidl does the same thing in Denmark, proudly explaining how most of their goods are actually Danish and not German
Most people say "Hallo" (hello) or "det er/ du taler med Caroline Amalie" (this is/you're speaking with Caroline Amalie)
Maybe I'm in the minority, but I would just say "Hej".
My grandfather used to answer the phone with his full name and jobtitle
I think it's an old person thing
I've also seen old people who answered by saying that addresses
Yeah, I know my grandfather was very sad then they discontinued the practice of having the titel in the phone books
I think it's also because there used to be more importance placed on titles overall
I know my grandfather was tjenestemand, which isn't a thing anymore but used to be quite prestigious, so he would say something like  "tjenestemand (name), (place)", well into his retirement years
He was the son of a widowed washingwife, so i think he was just so proud that he rose so high above his station, that he couldn't help but make it his entire identity
My grandmother was also tjenestemand, but just said her full name when answering the phone
Since she came from a very well-known family, so for her the title was no big deal, whereas her last name was
Unification happened in the 800s, which makes us at least 1100 years old
One king behind the whole thing
Denmark was founded in like 500 AD or something like that
Denmark is generally considered to be founded as a country in the 8th century, but there are signs of a country already from the 6th century
You forgot the Kingdom of Iceland 1918-1944
>Except it has only been a country since 1944
Iceland became a sovereign state in 1918 as the Kingdom of Iceland
The Kingdom of Iceland was independent in the union with the Kingdom of Denmark
That was why Iceland could decide to end the union
Yes, that's true, but Iceland actually had an Icelandic king
It was just the same person as the Danish king
So there were two kings but one person :-)
Fold the rear seats and/or use a trailer for 90% of such needs and rent a van for the rest
Practically every car in this part of Denmark has a tow hook, and every second household has a trailer, so
you use your own trailer, or borrow the neighbor's (or rent one, if you have to
A standard 600 kg trailer will cost ~$15/day, but lots of places will loan you one if you buy heavy or large stuff from them)
We have a horse, that our daughter likes to compete with, so we have a horse trailer that will fit practically everything we could ever need to haul - including junior's belongings when he moved out
We pull the trailer with a bog standard minivan with a 2
0l diesel engine
I know this is a typical comment from a Dane, but here in the cities distances are not a problem, so i load them on my cargo bike and bike with it
The cargo bike can handle bigger items than my compact car
If that still doesn't cut it, then i rent a trailer, for free, to attach to my car
Second this^
Work vans are also used sometimes
Most people who lives in the inner cities don't own trailers
Well a lot of them don't even own cars
There is usually space to park the trailer outside the inner cities
And in Denmark
If you are doing entire remodels in EU you just order the stuff from the hardware store and they deliver it to your door by truck
If your project is large enough delivery is free, for small projects you have to pay
Same as in existing drywall, for new you create a groove to lay it in then plaster over, or add plastic cable lines that you can draw the cable inside
Did you learn to cook in school
I actually don’t know if it’s required by law, but in Denmark, 95% of people I meet had cooking class in school
Normally from around 8-12 years old
Quality varies greatly - I remember one year it was really great, but then the budget was cut
But it was always everyone’s favorite subject, because sometimes you had a cool teacher and made cake
What about your country
Ay, I remember a butcher swinging by with half a pig (including head, tail, feet, ...)
We fed ourselves and all the teachers with the amount of food we made
It was like 30% in my school, but I had it and loved it
It’s actually kinda strange because most Danish schools don’t even have a canteen either, 90% bring lunch from home (and the rest goes out to buy kebab or whatever)
But we still have a kitchen for cooking class
Same here
My cooking book is awesome
Cooking, yeah
From having German in school, we learned about your school system a lot
However, I still don’t really get what hauptschule is
Something between gymnasium and realschule
How popular is each type of school
That’s so weird hearing from a Frenchman
Haha
If there had to be one single requirement, that should be it
I feel like a person who wants citizenship should speak the local language at least relatively fluently
It's okay if they aren't flawless and need to switch to english or something for a little while, but they should be able to get by day to day
It's pretty common in Sweden but it has nothing to do with a English language fetish more that the Swedish language is retarded
I am in the minority here, but I absolutely love the Dutch language
Traag is a great song, btw
No that's our pronunciation of words that's retarded, our language it self is pretty good
We just insist that every little inbred city has it own unique accent nobody really understands
Yea that proofs nothing a language being easy or hard to learn for someone from the Anglo sphere , doesn't make it less or more retarded
Also notice how it's the opinion of one person and the US disagree
Alot of Danes thinks Dutch is ugly
A mixture between of German and English .
Bro you can't say it's ok , you literally copy pasted our language
What's wrong with the number system
His country is why you never turning up drink to a meeting
Come on, man
it's half base 10, half base 20
we all know it's fucked up
Huh, I never thought about that
Your bibles may be safe, but your priests still have those absurd ruffs on like us
I awkwardly mumble hi when I pass them outside my apartment, and then I quickly leave
It varies alot in Denmark
It really depends on the neoghbourhood bit I would say in general neighbours know each other better in the towns and less so in the cities
it varies wildly from person to person
in some places, people in the apartment block are friends with each other
i live in such a place, or at least, partly
i personally am not social with people here but i greet people when i pass by etc
It's pretty common to be on speaking terms with your neighbors in the suburbs and smaller towns/villages
In the suburbs, you're usually not outright friends with them - you just stop to chat for a minute if you both happen to be in your driveways at the same time, and maybe you'll ask them if they can water the plants in your front yard while you're away or something
Actual neighbor friendships are more common in the countryside and small villages
In apartments in larger cities, it's similar to everywhere else in that you don't usually have much to do with your neighbors
You may say hi them if you see them on the stairs and can recognize them, but often not more than that
Of course there can be exceptions to this (I have a friend whose best friends are her neighbors whom she first met after moving into her apartment building), but you shouldn't have an expectation that you'll get to know all of your apartment neighbors personally
In Denmark it is decent (can't speak for the bigger cities, but where I'm from people are kind)
We have this thing called "neighbor help", which is a sign you put at the road so thieves know that even though the owners ER gone, there might still be a neighbor watching
For my own accord
I know my neighbors and what they do
We chat in the driveway if we meet
I imagine where cultural differences would show most Is in suburbs
Compare US suburbs - which often can't even be traversed without cars - to the suburbs I grew up in, where everyone biked and celebrated midsummer together
8min by bike
Across the Copenhagen habour
Pretty nice at the moment as the sun is setting when I bike home a everything is lit in a golden light :)
50 to 60 minutes by bus to University, to work 10 to 15 minutes by cycle
love the bus ride since it's where i listen to podcast or nap
I can either go 25 minutes by bike (preferable when the weather is nice), or 2 minutes walk to a bus stop, which will get me to the nearest metro station (which is 5 minutes away in bus), and then take the metreo for 8-ish minutes to a stop thats 5 minutes away on foot from my job
Copenhagen: I takes 25 minutes
Biking of course
When I'm in the office it's roughly a 45-minute drive on main roads
I spend the time listening to podcasts, audiobooks, and the occasional Spotify
When I'm at clients my drive varies from 30 minutes to several hours
Luckily Denmark isn't that big, so I'm usually back home every evening
5 min walk, 20 min metro, 5 min walk
About 12-15 minutes on bike, mostly through a single central neighborhood in Copenhagen
Pretty boring, but quite safe
It takes about the same if I take the bus along the same route, but it's just short of €2 for a single ticket, so I might as well get some exercise and save the money
Also the biking lane has room for about 3 bikes side-by-side most of the way, so it's easy to either just go with the flow in the inner lane or to speed up if you are in a hurry
Taking my car is out of the question
A single day's parking costs about €15
Icelandic & Faroese names
Just sounds so old-timey and cool
Also it's cool that they keep the old tradition of patro- and matronyms alive that we lost long ago, and only have remnants of
George, Victoria  Richard and François
Are the first that come too mind
Jason sounds badass and masculine imo
I don't think many children move out to live on their own :P
But I think it's pretty typical to move out at 18-19, because the financial assistance given to all adult students and cheap student housing actually allows people to do so
18-22ish
depends on which school, and where the parents live and of course, the economy of both the student and the parents
i moved out just before i turned 19
After high school (most people graduate between 18-20), young people generally start to prepare for it
It's pretty common to take one or two gap years after high school where you work and travel and use your parents' house at a base, but afterwards you're pretty much "expected" to have moved out or at least making concrete plans to do it (not that your parents will throw you out, but other people will think you're odd if you have never tried to live on your own after age 23 or so)
Normally just before University starts
Hence somewhere around 18-20
Personally I was 19
Yeah this sounds right
A friend of mine even moved out at 17
There's a canon pointed at sweden, and there's a old law, that says "If a swede walks on the ice water, you can kill him" This law is still counting, but we have so many other laws that there's no way around it
Could you please send some nice weather then
Of course you have, its just strange that even after all these houndres of years, the canons are still there
The whole talk of a "final form" is prety silly to me
Denmark has changed what areas it controlled several times each century in the last millenium, there is no definite area over long periods
There's an episode of black mirror where the villagers speak Danish
I don't remember which episode number
I was at a wedding yesterday in Timișoara(Western Romania), at the Orthodox Metropolitan cathedral
After it was done, we stood outside for pictures, and there was this huge group of retirees on a guided tour
After a while they started speaking Danish
Definitely a "what the fuck are the odds
"-moment
There's also a terrible Steven Seagal movie I can't remember the name of where the evil terrorists are Danish for some reason
Every Germanic languages that isn't English has Johannes
cupcake cafés. I have never seen one in my entire life
We don't really hate the swedes
We just won't admit they have beaten us once or twice in different things
Dammit, comrade, we have the most cupcake cafes and the best cupcake cafes
Reporting you to the workers tribune if you spread lies from decadent West again
> digitalisation is still regarded as this obscure new thing
Oh god yes
Establishing a business in Denmark literally takes less than two minutes with your national online-ID, and pretty much everything is self-service online
Germans apparently loves to use lots of physical pieces of paper for some reason
Shhyyyyyyyy
What the heck are you doing
That's why it's so awkward when you occasionally spot an actually genuinely aggro banter merchant on reddit (both sides, people), talk about missing the point, it's the online equivalent of going studs first into a tackle during a casual five-a-side in the park
>We don't really hate the swedes
Of course we don't hate the swedes of today
They are in general nice people, even though they need to practice their Danish skills more
We hate Sweden, the violent and arrogant country
It like you google “countries with high (blank)” and I look at, and I’m like damn, Denmark made it in the top 10 sweet
And then I look further up and I see that Sweden and Norway are placed higher and I’m like fuck
>Public health centres for youth provide contraception and STD checks free of charge if you're under \~25
Why doesn't your doctor do this for everybody free of charge
Do you pay for the your GP doctor in Sweden
> The idea that we have "no go zones" is pretty laughable
No-go zones are places where the fire department or the police are afraid to go in a single car, which there are plenty of in Sweden (some in Denmark as well)
> Public nudity and sexual openness
In the 70's nudity was almost compolsury in Swedish film, including nude children and nude adults, even in children's movies
Since then society has gotten more prude and young people today are probably about as prude and insecure about displaying their bodies publicly as in other places
Do people associate Sweden with those things
I thought that was us
After all, child pornography was legal in Denmark for many years
It's a turning point in any gay boy's life when he finds out, that the 'straight guys' are professional pornstars
I visited a German high school last year, and they were still discussing whether to install WiFi
Sorry Norway, everybody kind of likes you, even if you are rebel scum :)
>>We hate Sweden, the violent and arrogant country
Is that a thing where you're from
In my part of Denmark (the one closest to Sweden) it absolutely isn't, Sweden isn't viewed like that
Violent
> I see that Sweden and Norway are placed higher and I’m like fuck
Suck it Sweden and Norway
Denmark No
TBF, you lots have *perfected* the art of shuffling papers between various offices for *flippin' ages*. I've come to believe that any new company in France starts with at least three employees
Two administrative staff to handle the paperwork, and the founder
Just wanna say in all the negativity that this also makes Germany to me less superficial, more approachable, more people friendly and less stuck on appearing modern and with-it compared to what I know from home
It's hard to describe precisely but going to a market in Hamburg has a vibe we lost at some point during the 90s when we decided "folkelighed" (volkstümlichkeit) was no longer cool (at least in the capital region, they're probably less stuck-up in Jutland)
>Copenhagen feels like my second capital because of how close it is to where I live
You are perhaps living in Greater Copenhagen without even knowing it:
Wait what part do you live in
Amager
Sweden has been very violent throughout the history
Suck it Europe
I'm surprised it's not for free to go to your GP in Sweden like in Denmark
>The term "no go zone" is not used by Swedish police or any other emergency services
The term "särskilt utsatt område", Especially vulnerable area, is used
Yes, no go zones are the popular term for vulnerable areas, where emergency services are in high risk of being attacked
I thought that was some kind of city in Sweden and got super offended like, how dare they name a city after our capital and naming it greater
You can have the whalers if you return the north sea oil money ;)
Sure, you’re the little brother of the family
Mildly annoying yet adorable
So have we, and it was several life times ago
It's *really* strange cultivating a hate for that reason in 2019, and you must be extremely angry with Germany, then, considering the occupation was a mere 70 odd years ago
> As a matter of fact I do
That's awesome
Welcome fellow Greater Copenhagener :-)
>I've only ever heard "The Öresund Region" being mentioned in that context
Yeah, it was renamed some years ago
You are making us all Scanian now, you snaphane
We solved the border dispute with Germany in a civil referendum
We still miss to see Sweden granting Skåne, Halland and Blekinge similar referendums
Well, there are some disagreement about that
You wrote earlier:
" *In several areas, including in Stockholm and Göteborg, there are instances when the police need to escort ambulance and firefighters on calls
* "
But of course then you wrote:
" *This is however not based on specific areas, but depends on the kind of incident
* "
These kind of incidents tend to happen in the ghetto areas though, hence the term no go areas
Don’t wait too long
Greenland is so hot right now </fifth element meme>
Ah, you're joking, nice one, had me going
Joking
I would love to see the deputed territories getting referendums
Tradition in the waiting for skijump
No country has fought as many wars as we and the swedes has
&#x200B;
Edit: I just got a brand new axe, yall wanna see another war
In 1520 the Danish King Christian the 2nd had a big chunk of the Swedish nobility killed in what would later be called the [Stockholm Bloodbath]
At least it's funny when you're a Dane
Bluetooth is named after harald Bluetooth and the logo is his initials in the runic alphabet
It was named as such because like how Harald united the danes, Bluetooth unites devices
but only recognized by a few other countries that also claim land on the south pole
True, but at least we're not swedish
I think most politicans vote for themselves
Everyone would be if Sweden was their neighbor
I thought every country used their flag for birthdays
then I imagined how weird a birthday would look like with the german or french flag, because the danish flag is "*the* birthdayflag"
Pølsevogn !
It's sorta like a  hot dog cart you see in new york and such
but larger
like this:
they got hot dogs of course, but also burgers and a few other typical things
I've yet to see these in other countries
i've seen OTHER kinds of food-wagons/trucks but not like this
i know what they are
even featured in danish television
called Krokette in Danish
One of my favourite restaurants in Copenhagen is a galette restaurant
You can only order variations on galettes or crepes
But then again, it's run by a Frenchman, so it's not something that's very common here
Bruh are you for real
Jeg skal ha en død indianer med det hele, tak
I have heard Olsenbanden was quite popular in East Germany, no
[yeah]
forget choosing a theme, it's all flags when it comes to celebrations
christmas, new year's eve, anniversaries, whatever
flags everywhere
[we give students a sailor cap and let them drive around drunk everywhere in decorated military vehicles]
It's weird because most Danes I know think the Americans are overdoing it
We use it for any kind of celebration, but as soon as someone tries to use it in a political or nationalistic sense, it always sparks a huge debate
no, they don't. so strange
In Denmark it is called a bobspil
I did not know, it was a non-English invention :)
us scandinavians see our flags a bit different than many other countries
they represent joy and celebration, as well as symbolising a shared culture, language, and history
[Danes can be a little obsessive]
no, not like the americans
it's hard to describe, but it's definitely different from the americans
first thing being that the danish flag is rarely used for patriotic reasons
like I said: it's hard to describe
you would have to experience it yourself to understand it
Æbleskiver, definitely
There is no better way to celebrate Christmas than to get some æbleskiver from a Christmas market
Koldskål.
According to google, it's translated to "cold buttermilk soup".
Kaj kager, flødeboller, rødgrød med fløde, risalamende, hindbærsnitte, all so delicious and very danish
Gotta be risalamande, it sounds french but I can assure you that it's not
Before I clicked the link, I did not expect to see chocolate cake
I thought it was [klatkager] based on the name lmao
I beg to differ
No Danish dessert can match the glorious homemade [koldskål] with fresh strawberries and kammerjunkere .
Definitely my favourite summer dessert
Seconded
In the summer months I would probably say koldskål is my favourite dessert, whereas I would say æbleskiver or risalamande in the winter months
Can't imagine eating either of them outside their "months".
I remember once someone told me it's proven that Danes really love minimalism and moderation, by the fact that we all only eat our favourite dessert during a specific time of year
Its basically a dairy based milk combination, with or without eggs and lemon, and other types of Danish dairy products
to my knowledge these cant really be translated without losing their meaning completely
besides the recipe changes from family to family
Parfaits are more solid - this is literally just like a liquid/soup
Think of it as a dairy-based sweet soup
Mostly it's made by mixing a little bit of 'soured milk' (tykmælk - it's kinda like yogurt but thinner), a lot of buttermilk, vanilla, lemon, and sugar
Some people use eggs as well, though it's not something I've ever had
And then you can put in berries and stuff if you want to, but traditionally you only use kammerjunker, which is a type of vanilla biscuit
Basically, you should be able to drink it straight from a cup if it weren't for the biscuits
[Well it is a British democracy]
It's hardly on the level of the stuff the Germans, Russians, and Japanese did
You forgot “nisseøl” the very light beer that you drink with “risengrød”
Fun fact
"Julebryg" is just regular beer, but with vodka and Liquorice
Or so i've been told by a teacher i had once, who was in a brewery club
we (my class) also made beer with him
we made some and it really did add that weird "julebryg" taste (I'll add, "Julebryg" just means "Christmas brew")
Tuborg is the company behind our J-Dag here, we call it Tuborg Julebryg, which is Tuborg Christmas Brew when translated
Sounds like you are getting the same thing :)
Here is the original Danish Tuborg Christmas in [can] or [bottle]
Stille nacht is one of my favourite beers
I would imagine they also have the Tuborg Julebryg
Pilsner Urquell on tap is my favorite summer beer :)
in most towns, people here in Denmark have "fjernvarme" - which is basically heat transfered from a heating plant, through water (in pipes)
It's a closed system of sorts
so the plant transfers warm water to your house, which then runs through your radiators and such, and warms your home and your own water supply
You do NOT have access to the water from this system
You can't drink it and so on
it's being monitored for temperatures and such
Anyways, some also use gas, and some use oil or ... wood pellets
basically the closer you are to a town, the more likely you are to use "fjernvarme". almost all of copenhagen for example, use fjernvarme
it's a pretty efficient system
Pretty common here in Denmark
> Nonetheless wood heating is a demanding way to heat your house which is why people prefer other methods
Heating with oil has been one of the most common but other methods like air pumps, air to water pumps and geothermal heating are getting more and more common
My parents changed their oil pan to the air to water pump and they also have a fireplace to give excess heat when it's cold enough
> That is probably the most common way to use wood heating, as an excess heating method
Basically the same situation in Denmark outside the areas with district heating coverage
For actual heating purposes
I agree most homes have a fireplace for "hygge" in the cold seasons, but in my experience almost no people actually use it to heat their house and instead use other sources
Yes, it's pretty common where there is no district heating
Most houses will have another source of heating at the same time though
So for instance it is also to have a combination of a heat exchanger and a wood stove
In farms it's also common to have straw-burners (to feed the central heating system)
Some also do have wood/pellet burners to feed their central heating system
But they require a lot of work, so they aren't common
Depends on who lives there, our heating is mostly not used, since it isn't very useful
We only use it to heat up clothing, but it doesn't get used for much else, so we do use the fireplace for heating, since it has worked since we moved into this house
The only really good heating is in my room, which I don't use, since it's already very hot inside, with windows in my room open from the morning to afternoon
Temperature does not change
My dad heats his house in the winter with a fireplace
I think it's both for "hygge" for him, as well as the fact that he has a big and old house and turning on the fireplace is quicker and cheaper for heating, than going around turning on all the radiators so the cold from the other room don't spread to the areas he's in
When we learned about the Kalmar union and the Denmark-Norway union after that, we mainly focused on the good thing whereas the Swedish and the Norwegians tend to view it differently
The good things were that an united Scandinavia enabled Scandinavia (and thus Denmark) to stand up against bad forces from Europe such as the Hanseatic league
And the unification by a woman (Queen Margrethe I) was a major achievement
As unions they were not described as a Danish empire as such, but it was only much later, I discovered that Norway and Sweden actually were not part of Denmark but still three countries (Norway and Sweden being independent on paper)
The crusade and destruction of the Wends was described as self defence/revenge and the conquering of Estonia as a righteous and Christian crusade
Greenland and the Faroe Islands are what is left from the good old empire times and we should take good care of them
Actually, the real mistake was retreating from Russia in the winter
It was a rival to the Danish king and the interests of the crown
The Baltic Sea trade was very profitable and the league became also a political factor and thus a threat to the crown
There were numerous wars and fighting
In a way the Kalmar union ended because of this, as the Swedish were more interested in trading with the league than fighting it
Edit:
The hanseatic league tried to monopolize the trade in the Baltic Sea by blockading other cities or attacking them
They were somewhat of a menace and can be compared to the Trade Federation in Star Wars
Tokyo, Kawaguchi, Matsumoto, Kanazawa, Kyoto, Osaka, Hiroshima, Nagasaka, Nara
Isn't there a "Toyota" city
also kyoto, tokya, okinawa, fokushima and ... ehm
thats all i remember off the top of my head
I was very naive thinking everybody at least know Nagasaki and Hiroshima
Tokyo
Hiroshima
Nagasaki
.. sorry
For Denmark, the only one I can really think of is Lars Mikkelsen, the brother of Mads Mikkelsen
He’s narrated some big documentaries in recent years
We also have people like Søren Ryge and Jørgen Skovgaard, but they’re more niche
I don't know his name but he has voiced the docu series "Vilde vidunderlige Danmark" most of his stuff seems to be wildlife centered
Ah yes, I was thinking we didn't have one but  I'd forgotten Lars and how big Historien Om Danmark was, for example
I owe a 12-tal to that guy - I watched the entire series preparing for my oral exam in Danish history during my bachelor's.
I wouldn't say Søren Ryge is niche though - but that might be because of my age
> Vilde vidunderlige Danmark
Lars Mikkelsen, the brother of Mads
He is everywehre in documentaries right now, he made DR's Danish History one a few years ago, and also the Reunion with Sønderjylland one this year
Oh that's him
The name is so generic, that's why I forgot
Rasmus Paludan
Extreme right winger, open racist, and attorney
His slogan is something like "The guardian of the community, soldier of freedom, light of the Danes"
He is a huge Islam hater, burned the Koran on a one time use grill, said that every immigrant should be thrown out of the country, despite his wife being from Thailand
Almost seemed like a huge media stunt, even though it wasn't.
I would say Rasmus Paludan, but he barely counts as a politician
He only ran for prime minister once, and lost miserably
His policies included (and were pretty much limited to):
Banning islam in Denmark
Deporting every muslim from Denmark
When asked about his climate policy, he blamed the muslims
When his policies were compared to nazism (which is a fair comparison if you ask me), he just turned it around, and called the interviewer a nazi for asking such a question
The guy is irrelevant now, so thankfully none of his nonsense was ever considered
Just give us Skåne back and you won't have to worry about it
You're welcome
You probably won’t even be able to tell the difference, with the normal stench coming from Malmø.
> This guy keeps the whole government in check and nothing happens without his consent and he is not even the Prime Minister or President
How exactly does this work
Why do they care what he thinks
And yet people keep voting for his party
Luckily though, he is not a politician
I guess it depends on how you look at it
I'd rather take 1
8% of the votes for Paludan, than just under 50% for donald trump
I feel like it shows that the vast majority of people don't vote for the loudest stupidest guy they can find
He is a politician, yes
You don't have to be in the parliament to be a politician
I believe you just have to get mandates at "regionsvalget" as the bare minimum to be qualified as a politician, or you have to be part of a political group, who got a mandate
He got both personal votes, and so did Stram Kurs
So he's a politician
I shall tell my grandchildren of my brave service in the Shit Wars
It's just called "toast" here, and we put slices of ham in there too, usually
They're typically made in a panini press or something similar, though you can make them in a pan too
We’ve got the croque monsieur that everyone else has (we call them “parisertoast”), but we also have a version that I think is unique to Denmark called a “cowboytoast”, which is with ground beef
We were the first country to legalize porn
You're welcome
Do you know how if other EU countries pays to use the autobahn
Or is that just Austria
That's how we like it
Yeah the EU sucks for a lot of those reasons
You can come to Denmark from a EU country and work very little and suddenly become eligible for a lot of welfare, because of the same reasons, for example
Highways are also free for everyone in Denmark despite being a transport corridor between Europe and the North
You need to work 225 hours a year, but apart from that, the rules are the same
She must have had some savings or other stuff that made her ineligible
Citizenship and immigration is another deal
The Swedes have worse welfare than us, so we stay home, lol
Corfitz Ulfeldt married the kings daughter, got in a fight with the new king, his brother in law, defected to Sweden and helped them during the disastrous 1658 war that led to a loss of Scania
He is probably the biggest one, especially since he sold out to Sweden of all places
Britta Nielsen
She pretty much scammed Denmark for 111 million crowns and then rushed to south africa
Some woman named Britta Nielsen, found a loophole in our entire banking system, and managed to steal 111 million DKK
And if I remember correctly, she at first tried to play the pity card, then tried to play the "I was just showing you what was wrong
" card
Bitch
Rasmus Paludan's entire "campaign" (no other words are in my mind for it, other Danes might correct me, please do
I don't know the biggest scandal anymore, since there's always this and that as a "scandal" so I have no idea whats biggest currently
Var det ikke hende, der bare nappede lidt efter lidt, indtil at hun blev opdaget
Rasmus Paludan havde skandale skrevet på ham
Han lyder også til at passe som en
That we actually let people from Sweden work in Copenhagen
Naaaah
Jk aside
We're a very small country
Nothing is really shocking, because you meet people from different cultural areas every day
None, really
Too small and homogenous
Because Copenhagen is Sweden
Do i have to remind you how a [map of Denmark] looks like
Forsvarsministeriet which means "The Ministry of Defence".
Before 1950, Denmark had a "Ministry of War", but it was combined with the "Ministry of the Navy" to make the "Ministry of Defence"
In Denmark it's basically "The Defense" or Forsvaret
I don’t drink alcohol or milk
As a dane i dont like "rugbrød" (rye bread)
i dont drink
Beer tastes like shit imo
What do you have for lunch then
Nej tak, vi vil ikke have den slags typer
Oh no
"American conditions" is a political scare phrase used to describe a hypothetical situation where the liberals have gotten too much power and privatised and deregulated everything
“A town in Russia” refers to something unknown or strange
Like: My friend smells really bad, to him soap is a town in Russia
A “flying Dutch” is a football term used to describe when you leap forward to head the ball
"Svenskerfuld" = Drunk as a Swede = Very, very drunk
That's a city in Russia
Meaning it's farfetched or meaning the same as 'it's greek to me'
Alright, that's pretty funny
In Denmark we say “Du glade kineser” it means “You happy Chinese” and has the same meaning as yours, it isn’t used much anymore either
Never heard that, but I have heard "Du store kineser"
Strange might depend on where in Denmark you live I guess because I’ve never heard “du store kineser”
Probably, but I'm guessing it's not common at all
No I’ve only heard seniors use it
I don't know if it's exactly a *stigma*, but from what I gather, calling people in positions of authority by their first name and not their title would be a huge social faux pas in other countries . It's the norm here
In Denmark, the age for when someone is considered an adult in sexual relations is 15
Yup
Completely commonplace
[Here's a BBC story about it] (text, not video)
This could lead back to “janteloven”, here it’s almost considered rude to call someone out by last name, bc it would almost certainly be to make fun of someone
Usually we like to treat everyone with a certain amount of respect and we prob don’t think that authority should be treated (very) differently than our selves
In Denmark you're basically informed of when whaling season starts on the faioe islands, by the inslught of anti-denmark articles abroad
Once in a while, people will realise that whaling happens in the Faroe Islands and seal hunting happens in Greenland
People opposed to this will inundate /r/denmark with angry letters, petitions to the PM to stop it, angry rants against the government saying we must put pressure on them to stop it, calling us murderers, etc
The Danish government has nothing to do with what is hunted in the Faroe Islands or Greenland, but since they're part of the kingdom, they must be ours to tell what to do, right
Most people prefer making their own babies rather than stealing others afaik
Not really
Parents usually put a baby monitor in the pram in case they cry
Those students sound a little entitled, I'd say
"When in Rome
", etc
Getting made fun of sounds pretty harsh, but I can completely imagine the bus driver's face
Formal titles are just really, really not done, here
We call them all by their first name
I take it you mean if we use the informal pronouns
If so, then yes and no
We've done away with the formal pronouns, so there is only one way to address others
Yeah, I definitely think it has to do with treating everyone the same and not having anyone stand out or think they're better than everyone else for a particular reason
Affording the same amount of respect to the person who cleans the toilets as to the person who owns the company
As it should be, imo
Yeah, I've only encountered people being addressed by their last names when they are either being made fun of for being up their own arse or something like that, or when its used as a nickname
For example if there's several people in one friend group with the same name
If you called your boss Sir or Ma'am, here, they'd most certainly think you were taking the piss
I don't even think we use Mr/Mrs Lastname that much
The usual phrasing for someone you don't know is their full name, e.g. the PM would be "Mette Frederiksen" and not "Ms Frederiksen". Or you'd just say, "the Prime Minister".
Horse meat is some damn good meat
Just a shame you can't find it here
Oh la di da, you call the prime minister with informal addressing
You must be fancy /s
&#x200B;
The joke being that even in Denmark we don't do that
My cousin is a university lecturer and he says that entitled students are the bane of his existence
He gets requests for extensions, exemptions, and leniency all the time from kids who think they're special and don't have to follow the same rules as everyone else
I wonder if it's a Danish thing, or a generational thing
Ah, okay, good that it wasn't mean-spirited
If you want to get someone's attention and you don't know their name, you just say, "Undskyld" (sorry/excuse me) or "Hallo
" (hullo/hey)
If you said, "Undskyld, hr
/frue/frøken" (excuse me Sir/Ma'am/Miss), people would think you were a confused time-traveller from the 1950s or just a weirdo
Nice to see "How *dare* you
Where I'm from, this is perfectly legal
" is spreading
How embarrassing
Yeah, a simple "Tak" with no titles is as polite as it gets
The clever short ones find one of the countless bicycles in the canal, and stand on that
Historien om Danmark with Lars Mikkelsen (great actor, known internationally from things like Sherlock, The Killing, The Witcher and Star Wars Rebels
Oh and his brother Mads Mikkelsen, let's be honest
Its in danish, but when it came out, a guy in reddit translated the subtitles into English
I believe they are still available
Not available outside of Denmark but "Historien om Danmark" made by Denmark's Radio (DR) is a beautifully made show on Danish history divided into 10 episodes starting with stone age and ending with cold war/welfare society
Very comprehensive overview of the biggest events which helped shape the country
What’s the most random tradition or aspect of your country
What makes you think “why the fuck do we do that”?
Thought about this today when we danced [Les Lanciers] in my school
I thought for the longest time that this was just the most generic, standard partner dance people learned across countries, but I just found out it’s only a thing in Denmark
Les Lanciers is apparently some old French dance that was popular in the 1800’s, but is now only danced at one high school party per year by Danish teenagers because they’re forced to by their teachers
I have no idea why and it’s not like Denmark is a particularly dance-focused culture (almost the opposite, no one “can dance” and people aren’t expected to)
Is there a random tradition or quirk like that from your country
Edit: I forgot, we also fight each other with shaving foam when we graduate 9th grade (around 15-16 years old)
Thx for reminding me of lancier OP, God I hated that with a fiery passion
Aside from that, the studenterhue tradition is also pretty strange
I mean
in Denmark we also burn dolls (supposed to look like witches) on a bun fire to celebrate the days are getting longer
Oi looky here mate
I’m keeping this English for the sake of the subreddit, but don’t you go insulting Lanciers on my watch
I will fight you over this 1800’s French dance, and defend it to the last
In Denmark it is tradition to give people pebber if they are still unmarried when they reach 30
This is a little weird but nothing major
Jutland (part of Denmark) took one look at this tradition and thought "hey let's do something stupid and crazy", and what they came up with, was tying people to a street lamp when they turn 25 and covering them in cinnamon powder
[Here it is happening to a Danish youtuber]
How does this work in big cities like Vienna
Excuse me what
Fifteen looks really good
*Books one-way flight to Turkey*
We burn a witch doll on a bonfire on Midsummer
There’s a bit more history behind that though that actually makes sense
You guys have so much fun at birthdays
We’re just like “if it rains on your birthday it means you’ve been a horrible person”.
I just googled it -it looks kinda creepy lol
How do you pass it around
From friend to friend or neighbor to neighbor
This sounds so great
I love this so much
Wait
The skinny guy is actually called cannabis
We do that too
Interesting to know
What do you call it
Is it the same
True, but it makes a bit more sense
Like making noise and partying in a vehicle when to celebrate that you’ve graduated is pretty expected - minus the vehicle, but party buses exist in multiple countries
Lanciers (which I actually kinda like) is just like
why tho
We have something similar, with challenges and open truck and all, but we don’t have the “gang/team” aspect
It’s just your class
We do something very similar and so does Sweden
Hey we do that too
Every new years eve just before midnight
You have to drink every time he trips over the skin on the floor
Outside of the occasional “pagan” or “Wicca” hippie, no
Not like the witch culture that still thrives in Romania for example
I love this
In Denmark we have the insane partying associated with it
Okay, to be perfectly honest, this was just something I saw in a [Vice Documentary]
Joining the 30 years war
Our minister got so drunk at a lunch with the Norwegians that he gave up many of the oil fields in the north sea and signed a permanent contract on it
Denmark
Maybe not THE dumbest, but choosing wich country should get wich part og the northern sea didn't go in our favour
Norway got way to much of the oil
Legend has it that our king was drunk while doing it
Look, it was pretty stupid of us to get into a war with Prussia in the first place
It would have been equally stupid for Sweden to go down that route with us
San Marinos plates are beautiful with the blue and the crest
[San Marino Plates]
But to be a little biased I think the Danish ones are beautiful in the simplistic way, with big bold letters and numbers
[Danish Plates]
Denmark without a doubt
Who doesn't like black letters on a plain white piece of metal
How does it show that they don’t like the EU
Does the EU-flag on our plates represent that we don’t like Iceland
In Denmark it's like 1100€
They're actually cheaper than they used to be
The government is unapologetically treating the plates as a cash cow, raising and lowering the prices every few years to maximise profit
Also fun fact you have to renew them every 8 years paying 90% of the original cost every time
Also calling robbery is a bit much
A large part of why they can do it so unapologetically is that they're an indulgence, no one is forcing you to buy them and no one actually has a need for them (not to mention no one really benefits from them)
They're a complete superfluity
Idk, at least in my social circles it's generally only viewed as wasteful, not sure if many people consider it flexing to have custom plates
Sure, some people with too much money and no good ideas on how to spend it, might get a set of custom plates
Where I live, I rarely see them and if so, it is used by companies as a sort of advertising (like driving instructors for instance
Outside of Copenhagen and Aarhus I would say Aalborg, but it still doesn't have the city vibe but more a big town vibe
Other than that I would say Vejle or another town in the triangle-area
Danish equivalent of the tristate area in the US, but just with towns of Vejle, Kolding and Fredericia
Copenhagen always sees a lot of development
Except for Copenhagen I would say Herning, Silkeborg, Aarhus and Odense
What about Odense
In 2012, after finishing the new ring road and a bridge across the fjord, they closed down the main road through the center of the city and started to build a new city center on it
The new city centre opens this year
[Official website of the project]
Also the new tram system is to open this year as well
I intentionally left out Odense because it seemed like it has been under construction since forever
It has, but to me, that is recent development
The scale of the reconstruction and development makes me believe it is the city in Denmark which has seen the most development recently
A useful Wikipedia
The Danish one is tiny - even the Norwegian and Finnish Wikipedias are much bigger - and has amateurish articles everywhere
And smooth snakes
What do you mean not useful
Kradser
En kradser er et pølsebrød med sennep som hovedingrediens, og forskelligt andet indhold, der kun sælges fra en pølsevogn
Ingredienserne til en kradser kan variere, men som basis gælder at der anvendes et pølsebrød. På pølsebrødet tilføjes forskelligt tilbehør som findes i pølsevognen, og i forvejen anvendes til andre retter
Typisk kan kunden frit vælge imellem hele udvalget uden at der ændres på prisen
Ingredienserne kan være:
Ketchup
Sennep
Ristede løg
Rå løg
Fransk sennep
Remoulade
Syltede agurker
Fransk hotdog dressing
Chili-dressing
Ved valg af få ingredienser, fx ketchup, sennep og ristede løg, vil de blive anbragt på pølsebrødets underside, da den er mere plan end oversiden, og tilbehøret glider så ikke af
Ved valg af flere ingredienser vil det opskårede pølsebrød blive åbnet, og ingredienserne lægges i åbningen, så de ikke glider af, når hele sortimentet bruges
Pølsebrød er opskåret så de kan bruges til at lægge en pølse i, hvilket gælder for en hotdog
Ernæringsmæssigt er det ikke en specielt fiberholdig ret, men er dog den eneste ret i en pølsevogn der henvender sig til vegetarer
Prismæssigt er en kradser billigere end fx en hotdog
I år 2007 svinger priserne på landsplan fra kr
5,- til 9,-. Specielt prisen er også årsagen til kradserens popularitet
Efterspørgslen på kradsere er faldet i nyere tid, og det er derfor sjældent man ser kradseren nævnt på menukortet i pølsevognen
Mange pølsevogne sælger dog gerne kradsere hvis man spørger, men man skal være forberedt på at blive afvist
Oh don't worry, we're right up there along side with you
It's so baffling how everyone is miserably in the summer because of our incredibly well insulated houses but air conditioning is still frowned upon
would switch Danish for German cuisine at an instant
this is literally the first time I have ever seen a Ƶ
I write  Ƶ  in lower case, but it comes from working with math
I just think that most danes just don't write z.
Same here for both Z, W and Q
Same here
Also Norwegianizing loan words
Like writing sjalu instead of jaloux
I think most people do have a middle name
I don’t have a middle name and I like to think I’m a bit unique in that regard
Yes, it's very common - I'd guess more than half of the population has a middle name
My middle name is my dad's last name, and my last name is my mom's last name (my mom kept her last name when they married), and getting a last name from both of your parents is probably the most typical kind of middle name, but having a first name as a middle name is also very common
You guys do tend to have 5-7 names
It’s always interesting to see how many names a new Portuguese colleague of mine has, but indeed seem to rarely use them, outside your first and last names
I love my second name
I hate my last name
i dont know if this is just a thing for movies and tv shows
but not taking your shoes off when you get home
You've got sand, maybe mud, water, dirt etc, in your shoes and you just carry it around in your home
that's just disgusting
I don't really get why you prefer trucks over vans
Does it not rain on your stuff
Wearing shoes inside
Keeping their shoes on while inside homes
Their portion sizes
Gi-fucking-gantic
I mean, I dont complain, it's nice to bring the leftovers home for a midnight snack, but that concept was so foreign to me
Yea it's so weird
Usually the only stickers you will find on cars in Denmark is [this] It says "support our soldiers".
>Those churches where you sing
This is something that weirds me out, when I was in church last time in Romania
Why is it only those 6-9 people who get to sing
but I do that
it is so much more efficient to cut up all the food first to make it ready for the fork, although I do use the knife to get all the sauce on the fork as wel,
I guess we kinda relate to them in a way to be honest
Though theirs may be a bit more in-your-face-ish
In Denmark, 0% of kids die in school shootings
The closest we got was in 1994 on Aarhus University, where a guy killed 2 other students
I always take off my shoes, also in the Netherlands - is it not normal here
That's a dangerous question
This is a Greek Catholic church, so it's a fun mix between the two, no obscene amounts of gold like in the Orthodox churches(I've been in a few for weddings), but no comprehensible singing either
[In Danish Lutheran churches, it usually goes a lot like this] mind the piss-ugly modern church though, couldn't find good footage from a more traditional one), where everyone has a book of hymns
well both hands are on utensils, regardless of which I use
You don't know me
Stop caring
Copenhagen
There has been an explosion in construction along the harbour front and in an old military site which is now full of archictecture seen in the link
[Fjordenhus] in Vejle, Denmark by Olafur Eliasson
Yes, there are some old castle vibes there
It even has a drawbridge of sorts
It's even more impressive up close because of the insanely detailed masonry and general art-approach to the entire building
Nothing is random, everything is part of the design
Why-ever would you put that in quotes
If anything, you're country is an excellent example of the kind of issues a European federation might meet on a continental scale
Danes and Finns are very alike to each other, quite similar to Germans and Brits, relatively similar to northern French and perhaps northern Italians, and only vaguely similar to the Balkans or southernmost Europe
Even current states, like Spain and Britain, have issues with secessionists, despite Scots and English or Catalans and Castilians being *much* more similar than Norwegians and Serbians
I think a lot of progressives, particularly federalist progressives, have this notion that we all ought to get along, that the differences between our nations are really inconsequential
Well, maybe a well-off, city-dwelling federalist from Finland is quite similar to a well-off, city-dwelling federalist from Portugal, but neither are representative of their nations' average people
> I don't think political integration have to mean cultural integration too
Political integration *always* means cultural integration
To say otherwise is to speak of unevidenced hypotheticals
Compare Russia today to the region 300 years ago, or France, or Spain, or the US, China, or literally any other country
The only large states that don't have overwhelming tendencies towards single languages dominating are either recent or not very cohesive and fraught with infighting
Different people have different ideologies and philosophies of life (and therefore, governance)
The government can't appeal to everyone at once, and so as long as cultural differences exist, the government will clash with local peoples
This always leads to either the locals being forced to assimilate (see: Wales, Turkey, France, the US, China), or the situation devolving into civil war and secessionist movements (see: Yugoslavia, Spain, Denmark, Ireland)
I listed those as two outcomes, but even then, most of those countries were really examples of both
Yearh danish rail is so shitty they outsource parts to DB for more efficiency
> Finns are similar to Danes, who are similar to Germans, who are similar to Austrians, who are similar to Slovenians, who are similar to Croatians, who are similar to Serbians etc
I know, but that was precisely my point, with the addition that it doesn't come around
Danes are similar to Norwegians, and Serbians are similar to Bulgarians, but Bulgarians aren't similar to Norwegians
They are *more* similar to Norwegians than to Thai, that is true, but also irrelevant
The point is that while you could probably lump Danes and Norwegians together without problems (although saying that, read up on Dano-Norwegian history), but the same doesn't go for Danes and Serbians
Hell, even Serbians and Croats didn't work out, and they are about as similar as you can get
> My country is a separate case its not based on differences but deeper political reasons and prior propaganda it has nothing to do with the subject
Ah, so the fact that Greeks and Turks differ on rather essential points is unimportant, yes
And all the issues with Greeks in Turkey and Turks in Greece during the 20th century were *purely* political
Well, they certainly were political, but where did those politics come from
They came from locals desiring independence from a regime that didn't represent them
> How do you think the roman empire came into being
Through conquest and cultural imperialism
>  the "differences" you listed are differences that arise after we are born they are taught differences
Yes, that would be what we tend to call *culture*. Me being a Dane is genetic on the ethnic level, but in terms of culture, that is something I have learnt, yes
It's the customs, norms, traditions and values that have been handed down to me from my family and my kinsfolk
Yet to you, what most would call *culture* is "differences" in parenthesis
That's not surprising - that's how most federalists think
That's also why a united EU is never going to happen
> no one is saying lets instantly create this EU state, but lets just take a step towards that
"No one is saying let's instantly create the Roman Empire, but let's just take a step towards that
So, using your own example of Rome, how do you think the above would have sounded to a Gaul
It proves that even minute differences mean the world
You cannot seriously be deluded enough to think that ethnic/cultural/religious differences don't matter
> If you looked as of right now to the cultures of those countries you will notice that there are many many similarities both genetic and cultural, although the latter is more common
Quite to the contrary
The genetics are more similar, while the cultures differ more
Ionian Turks would have considered themselves Greeks less than a millennium ago
Yet to say that Turks and Greeks are culturally similar is a vague statement at best
They share many commonalities, sure, deriving in part from common history, in part from common circumstance and environment
Yet clearly, the differences are substantial - the issue of religion not least of them
To deny that is to deny literally a thousand years of war, not to mention the current geopolitical tension
> Because they were opressed as Christians under the Ottomans not opressed by the others that lived amongside them
But the Ottomans *were* the Turks
The elite, yes, but to claim that they were completely unrepresentative of common sentiment is just plain wrong
Of course Turks and Greeks could and do coexist, but the fact of the matter is that the history of the two peoples is one of constant strife and one oppressing the other
Whether Greeks coexisted with neighbouring Turks is not the point - the point is that Greeks did not wish to be *ruled* by Turks, and that they were not satisfied until they reclaimed their own state
That has always been the situation, and is still the situation - people don't want to be ruled by foreigners, particularly not ones that are culturally different/opposed
> Would an European federaion opress people
Yes, it would
If it didn't, it would never succeed
Even a single nation like France could not have existed in its current form if not for the ruthless oppression of local populations (Occitanians, Bretons, Basques, etc)
On the flip-side, if you aren't quite so ruthless and allow the locals more cultural independence, you get a situation like Spain
And even then, Spanish is rapidly supplanting most of the local languages, even with their relative degree of autonomy
Most Catalonians don't speak Catalan
> I gave that example because Roman empire was an example of a great multiethnic empire
A multi-ethnic empire born through conquest, which resulted in the extinction of nearly every other language in Mediterranean Europe save Latin
Rome is why Celtic is restricted to a few scattered remnants in the Atlantic
Rome is why Etruscan doesn't exist anymore, why Roman is the only remaining Italic language
Rome was a great empire and should be celebrated, but in the analogy you are setting up, my nation aren't the Romans - we are the Gauls
> Even USA is multiethnic
Racially, sure
Culturally, it's a monoculture to an insane degree
The amount of cultural uniformity in the US is almost unbelievable, considering how massive an area it is
And again, in that comparison, we're not the Americans, we're the Indians
> Turkey is multiethnic to actually but you know why the country does not have intercommunal issues
Because ethnic minorities tend not to trouble you when you've deported or genocided them all
> by living in the same environment you learn about others and they don't seem so alien to you after a while and you just notice that they are human too with almost identical behaviors
Yes, but what's the end-goal here
A US-like situation where Europe is almost entirely culturally homogeneous
That could work, sure - the US proves as much
But what would be that dominant culture
What would we all speak
How would we all act
Whose values would we all follow
I don't want to be "European", I want to be, and am, Danish, and I will fight to protect my country and culture from any pseudo-imperialistic notions of a hegemonic "European-ness"
> No, it proves that propaganda is what means the world
This has nothing to do with propaganda
We are talking about a pattern literally as old as history
The fact that different peoples feud with each other, or more precisely, that different people wish *seperation* from each other, is attested in more or less every instance of history
Different people may coexist peacefully, as long as both are allowed to practice their differences
Once one gains power over the other, however, there is an inevitable conflict
Let's say there are two peoples, A and B. They differ on core conceptions of ethics and religion, and practice different ways of life
Initially, both posses their own territories bordering each other, and are engaged in peaceful trade
If people A begin ruling people B, A cannot impose their values and rules upon B without conflicting with people B's own culture
Yet if they do not impose their own norms and regulations, people B will be impossible to govern, since they don't ascribe to their rulers' ideas of governance and values
Therefore, and again, inevitably, conflict will arise, and B will seek independence from A. The only possible outcomes from this are 1
Independence for people B, 2
assimilation of people B into A, or 3
a constant state of ethnic tension and conflict
This is why, as regards peace-making, the singularly most effective piece of construction is not, and has never been, the bridge
It has always been the wall
There are already some Danish Disney princesses from The little Mermaid and Frozen
Both based on fairytales by Hans Christian Andersen
[like this]
The Little Mermaid which is a HC Andersen fairytale
The Frozen sisters are Norwegian but could also be Danish, at least by looks, with a squirrel or a horse instead of a snowman and reindeer
Edit: Saw another alresdy posted exactly this
Wasn't the southern isles supposed to be Denmark in Frozen(aka, where Hans comes from)
And besides we already have our beautiful Princess
His name is Holger Danske ;)
The same artist actually did the [Finnish Maiden ] as well
I can't say
It's only loosely based on the Snow Queen
The scenery is ~~mostly~~ Austrian and ~~a bit~~ Norwegian
Frozen is based on a Danish fairytale, the Snow Queen, by HC Andersen
Yes, the scenery in the cartoon is from Norway and Austria
And slightly aroused
I think most people think of Hallstatt, Austria
Not directly, but it is mentioned
We mostly learned and heard about what happened during our occupation
Nothing much otherwise
Only basic stuff
In geography we don't really learn about all the different countries, cities, and rivers
These are the things i can remember learnig: plate tectonics, different proffesion types, climate, weather and exports and poduction around the world
What’s the most impressive piece of architecture in your country
honestly, i dont really know
but a lot of stuff outside of Denmark are drawn by danish designers/arcitects
like the opera house in sidney, or the "La Grande Arche de La Defense" in france
[Storebæltsbroen]
Fun fact, you can actually see this thing from [Stevns Klint] through some binoculars they have there
Here's a [picture] I took of it
According to Google maps it's around 50km
Giv os Skåne tilbage for fanden
Customs officer or parking attendant
Over here in Denmark, I’d say the most hated people in any job position are the train “controllers”.
Basically ticket guards, they roam all the methods of public transport and verify whether or not you have a ticket for your mode of transportation(or something of equal function like a travel-card)
If you don’t have a train ticket or anything like that, they’ll write you bill of about 100€. For this reason alone people hate them as any morning commute can turn into a financial nightmare
They are also known for being extremely petty about their apparent “authority” and will try to do short of everything to make your day worse
I remember a few times when Danish Zoos would have to kill an animal for some reason and would do it publicly
Once, I think it was Odense Zoo who killed a giraffe publicly, which is completely normal practice, foreign media really blew it out of proportions
Why not teach kids some biology while we're at it
Edit: the specific case of the giraffe apparently was Copenhagen zoo
Also, it was the act of dissecting the animals that caused foreign outrage
When the Syrian refugees were walking through Europe, a lot of focus was on the Danish "jewelry law" regarding when refugees apply for asylum
From my understanding, the law says that when you apply for asylum in Denmark, if you carry jewelry of high value with little sentimental value they can be confiscated to help pay for your asylum
This was then reported as us stealing all the jewelry of the refugees
From what I have been told, it has only been used once and we are not even the only country with that law
Supposedly Germany has it also (feel free to correct me on that), but all the focus was on us
In 2015 international news blew up a story about my local zoo dissecting an already dead lion, in front of an audience
The zoo thought it would be a good idea to show the anatomy of the animal, so the public might learn something
The international media disagreed, and a lot of international news outlets showed up to something that essentially wasn’t news
It was Copenhagen Zoo
[Here] is the chief of the zoo very calmly and patiently explaining to an ass of a news presenter why killing a giraffe and having kids watch the autopsy/butchering of it was not a bad thing
Huge kudos to Bengt Holst for keeping his cool, even though you can clearly see he is so over the Channel 4 guy and his extremely leading questions
I'm not sure if it was euthanised publicly, but it was dissected in front of the public for educational means
Just recently a dead whale was dissected and the British and American media again threw a fit
Jesus, how hard is it to say, "Sorry, I don't understand what you're saying
You're right it was the public dissection that made them go bananas
i've got no idea what is stereotypical for danish people to do
Two days ago i had a whole lunch involving either pork or canned fish on ryebread at 11:20 in the morning
Later I had dinner at 17:30
Also, saw a 'fiend' at a cross and went the other way to avoid small talk
It was a good day
That genuinely makes me happy
sometimes I don't even know what I am saying myself
"You just ordered thousand liter milk"
To be fair, drunk Danish teens in Prague are the worst
And the drunkest
So I don't blame you
poor swedes
> Speaking Danish
Interesting
Denmark started allowing dual citizenship in 2015, and I think most people are ambivalent to the change
Personally, I think dual citizenship is alright so long as strict and rigorous requirements for naturalisation are maintained
You want citizens to have a strong connection to the country, and not simply become citizens for convenience or welfare
How does it work with a Spanish citizen wishing an additional citizenship
Is that problem free
Within the EU you can live and work in the other EU countries
In Denmark you qualify for social services once you're a citizen, so I think it's fair if we required the Danish citizenship to be the only one you have
Are you referring to the 2014 russian annexations
My cousin is half Italian half Danish, and I remember he turned 18 before 2013 and had to 'pick a citizenship' (if you are below 18 you were able to hold dual), and he picked Danish, even though he grew up in Italy, since it would help him both education- and jobwise
Then they changed it in 2015 and he was so gutted
Luckily Italy is quite open about having people with heritage get their citizenship, so he got it back basically straight away but honestly, I just remember us all thinking it was so stupid he even had to pick
If Spain won't let you have duel citizenship and you think your true identity is Romanian, then why don't you live in Romania
Then why could you want to keep the citizenship
If Spain is better, you have more friends there, and you've spent most of your life in Spain, why would you prefer the Romanian citizenship over the Spanish one
Mine is french
And Swedish is my least favorite
Russian honestly
German
Rude
They are, very
When a Dane and a Norwegian (or Swede) speaks they’ll both continue to speak in their native language
Typically goes like this:
Anyone can read each other’s language easily
Norwegians understand Swedish with ease and Danish with a little less ease
Will have trouble actually speaking Danish especially
Swedes understand Norwegian but often have trouble with Danish
Danes understand Norwegians easily and Swedes a little less easily
France: The “they surrendered in 5 seconds lol”-jokes are getting old, and it’s incredibly disrespectful
Sweden: “rape capital of the world” is a phrase I wish would die out
Iceland: sure not a lot of people live there, but it’s not an insignificant country, they have a lot of culture, nature and excellent cuisine (and people are really nice)
All of Scandinavia/Nothern Europe: Calling Nothern European people “a bunch of commies” is incredibly dumb imo
Sweden and Norway
If anyone is gonna bully those drunken pieces of shit, it's gonna be us
Do not ridicule Sweden or Norway
Only we can ridicule them
Technically not a country "beside my own", being a part of my own, but I dislike it when people mock Greenland and Greenlanders because of their problems with alcoholism and high suicide rates
It's especially bad when Danes are the ones doing it (which is the case most of the time)
Those are very serious issues stemming from systematic issues with their society which we, as the more economically and socially advantaged part of the country, ought to help fix
Greenland is part of Denmark - their country facing such severe issues is if not our fault then at least our responsibility to help improve
Beyond that, Nazi jokes about Germany, surrender jokes about France, and the increasing amount of vitriol being thrown at Russians
The latter particularly disturbs me, since it often seems to be deeply held prejudices and indeed hatred passed as being "woke".
>I don’t like it when people say bad things about Poland
It's fair if you don't like bad jokes
I don't either
But it is fair to criticise a country from they do / have done
The rapefugee thing on Sweden is not really a joke, as much as it is a extremist talking point based on misinformation
It's complete bullshit, just like the stories on no so called "no-go zones".
I really don't mind being poked fun of, but that seems to be 50% of the teasing coming from Norway and Sweden, and it's long since gotten stale
That's a lot to Greeks
Well clearly you don't live in a city which direct ferry's to both countries
Og til her svenske og norske røvhuller
Ja i er alkoholiske mongoler, men det er jeg er fandme også.
That goes for every single country on the planet
Ja der er sgu nok noget om snakken så.
My parents called me (name)"-Chen", which I guess is more German tradition, than danish
My brother called me Rugge, which is a gibberish version of my name, and my mum also called me "lille frøken himmelblå", meaning "little miss sky-blue (eyes)"
Skiftning in Danish
Hehe, "*minge*"...
Can't say for danish, but a couple of years ago I did an intensive 3 month Duolingo course in Russian
I learned enough to convince people that don't speak russian that I did speak it, but I didn't learn very much
The only phrase I remember was something like "that's my bike", which I'm sure will come in handy

Painfully legal in Denmark and painfully common
Circumcision of boys for non-medical reasons
In Denmark, and from what I gather also most of the civilized world, circumcision of female children is already illegal
We just need to extend that to the boys also
Everyone is against cigarettes but as soon as alcohol or Xanax or any other thing is mentioned, they run away
Prank ringing doorbells in the middle of the night
They are for the most parts though
problem is investigation and proof
Rest in peace Uffe Holm's career then
There is a good reason why it is a good idea that people with criminal records can be elected though: some form of protests against oppression are illegal, but they are seen as saviours in hindsight
A lot of politicians from the former East block has been convicted of something
We tried to do it a few years back
We have crazy popular support for it, something like 80+%.
But it was voted down in Folketinget due to "national security concerns", which translates from bullshit to English as "it would piss off the Jews (in addition to Muslims), therefore it would piss off Israel and by extension also the US".
You can bet your ass that if it had just been a Muslim tradition, it would've been banned with 90% voting yes
Livet er dejligt
I don't particularly like circumcision, but this is the reason I would prefer it to be legal
Better have it in a private hospital than the basement of a church
"But my religion allows me to chop my sons penis in pieces without asking him"
indoctrination at its worst
Yeah, I was really disappointed when that happened
Yeah I agree
If I had to choose between which two of them should be illegal I would definitely choose the one for females, but since we have no such constraints in real life we should aim to make both of them illegal
And
Yes
yes
That is however not as widespread, so that argument is less valid
just male genital mutilation
There is a big difference in how wide-spread it is
The same could be said of female circumcision yet we still made that illegal
Yeah I get that, but I dont see why that is valid reason for it to be legal
If I went out and claimed that my religion says that all babies should have big tribal tattoos around their biceps, I would still be jailed for child abuse if people found out I had done it, even though tattoos can be removed
Fuck, even spanking is illegal
So why should the act of cutting off the skin of the boy's penis be legal, when we already have banned female circumcision for both religious and non-religious reasons
So if it is incentive that is the key driver, would you then say as soon as a large enough group of people start doing something to their children, we should legalise it so they can do it safely
Could be tattoos, piercings or FGM
I believe that will just lead to more damage long term, as it will take way longer for people to stop circumcising
We may as well wait for them to drop whatever religious or cultural ideas that demands it, which can take centuries if they live in a large enough community
In Danish, Nøkken is a hairy manlike monster that lives in swamps and drags people into the water
Reading the comments I feel like there os some miscommunication of what a party is
There is a big difference between what a party entails when being in your twenties and what is means as you get older
All parties I ever attended with my twenty-something friends were BYOB, and the main goal was to get as wasted as possible
Here it makes sense to bring your own, since people drink different amounts and it's annoying to run out of booze
This of course doesn't mean that that people don't share
At more "adult" parties, like weddings or big birthdays it is more common that the host provide wine and beer and at more informal gatherings it's common that each person bring something like a bottle of wine
As a Danish person I would say it's far from universal
For young people most parties seem to be BYOB
You bring your own drink, so you prepare based on how much you expect to drink, and then mostly stick to that
But even then a certain amount of sharing is usual
For more "grown-up" parties I think it's expected that the host provide most but guests will bring a bottle or two which will more likely be shared
Denmark birthdays in school: Usually the person who has their birthday a weekend before school or exact day brings some candy or something for everyone who wants it (some people don't like this or that)
Then they have a birthday at home as well (of course)
&#x200B;
Edit: I live in Denmark, that's why I know
This is not uncommon, in a few Nordic countries too
We call everyone by their first names
Anything else went out of style 50 years ago or so
Gonna need a source on that one, sounds fishy
I don't experience this in Denmark
Usually in my family/friends we bring and share, or the host pays for drinks - if you don't want to share; don't bring
Usually with good friends, there's an unwritten rule that if you paid for drinks, the other one will pay for drinks another time
Exception: The only exception is young people at parties, then we see it as rude if you don't ask first
We hate people who try to mooch/take other people's drinks
Nah, I’ve never encountered that
This
It's not that hard, people
Red solo cups and dressing as cheerleaders and/or Trump
My family's tradition is congratulating siblings of said person, parents, grandparents, and if they are siblings, the others congratulate us
And it was Danish for many centuries before that
I think it’s generally considered cheap in Denmark to keep the alcohol to yourself, though alcohol is way less expensive than it is in Sweden
I'm kinda split in all these comments, there's a difference in culture at a "family party" and a "I'm gonna get smashed party"
I disagree - it'd be considered cheap to keep it for yourself, but it'd  be considered more cheap to not bring your own to the party
And very rude to simply take other peoples without asking, which is what we're talking about here
People share left and right at a party, but if you had a bottle of whiskey and someone else had a bottle gin, you might share or exchange, to get variation in drinks - but if somebody else simply drank your whiskey not having asked you beforehand, that would be very rude
When it's provided and planned and you bring your own: not very polite
Family party could be things like confirmation, whenever someone turns 50/60 etc
and weddings
We can generally tell just by "what sounds right". In some cases, with new additions to the language mostly, there will be some disagreement about what should be the correct article, but overall we just know by "instinct".
Pretty much always you'd know whether the definite article would be -en or -t. Neuter gender or plural gender
I honestly don't know how we do it
I think there are some rules like in German, but for comparison German would have way more rules when it comes to gender
In Danish the case is mostly "What sounds right".
As someone who's still learning German, I would root for "das Nutella". Maybe because it is neuter gender in Danish, which can be interpreted as neutral gender
Edit: I just realised it might change gender depending on context
If it is the jar itself it would be neuter gender: "Nutellaen" but if it out of the jar some might say "nutellaet", plural gender
That makes sense, because my Ukrainian friend almost never uses the word “the” when she writes in English
That's funny, we get a lot of British crime drama
I have no idea what stereotypes there are about the Danes
the swedes try to banter a bit but all they can say is "dansk jävler" or whatever, and it's getting kind of old - and it's got nothing to do with stereotypes
Danes are reserved
I only hate it ‘cause it’s true
I see Dutchmen as passionless VOC employees with no joy in life aprt from profit and tulips, is that entirely wrong
Niflheim - 5° = winter jacket
5° - 10° = t-shirt, shirt and wind jacket
10° - 15° = t-shirt and wind jacket
15° - 20° = t-shirt
20° - 25° = topless
25° - Muspelheim = don't leave the house
I will die
I have never been comfortable in short sleeves or shorts for that matter if it is under 15 C. Although in Denmark you see a ton of people wearing summer clothing by the beginning of March
I presume a (wise) factor in Southern Europe is also protecting your skin from the sun
Difficult to separate than from culture now since is probably evolved centuries ago
Stram kurs gaining massive popularity
You people have so many peninsulas already leave some for the rest of us
Well anybody who ever killed a Swede in battle of course
Rasmus Paludan
Cursed be his name
>what is now Sweden
Were the lands of the Geats and Sveas not united in a single country before Vasa
Ah yes, admiral Nelson
The real villain of the Napoleonic Wars
If you kill them really good, they put your face on a box of matches
Nansen seems criminally underrated by the Norwegians, and he's basically a god damn legend
&#x200B;
Edit: Seriously, why aren't you guys worshipping him more
He was a titan amongst men, a figure that could carry a country on his back, better than lutefisk on bread
Haha that was a good burn
We have to live up to expectations
Our "rivalry" has been memed so much that I feel people would be dissapointed if we did not keep it up
>It would be very weird (and impossible regarding logical consistency) to view Denmark ca 1300 as a country but not Sweden at the same time
Well, Denmark's "birth certificate" was literally written in stone in the around 950 AD whereas the Sweden as we know it today was born with Vasa as you point out
The way I understand it, is that Götaland and Svealand were separate nations but under the same ruler (somewhat like the UK) from around the 11th century and it was not until Vasa, they were considered one nation
>I doubt the Jutes considered themselves "Danes" by 950
It's believed the majority of the Jutes emigrated to Britain by 500, as their lands in Jutland were exhausted
It's actually in the same periode, you can trace the first Danish parliament or *ting* back to, so the Danes went from a tribe to a people (of more more tribes) with a nation long before year 950
The rune stone from 950 is just very concrete and marks the beginning of the Danish state as we know it today similar to Vasa and Sweden
My grandfather organized some underground schools in his town, during the occupation of Denmark in WW2
Apparently, the original school had been seized, and only the younger children were allowed to still get taught
So he organized something for the sxith-form aged children, and kept at it until the place they were got raided
Apparently, during the raid an officer looked through my grandfathers' lunchbox, and lifted the meet on his sandwiches, to check if there were any hidden messages
My grandfather, being a mouthy-sort-of guy, complained saying that was "disgusting" and "now he couldn't eat it", which earned him a beating-up and having to stand against the wall with a gun pointed at the back of his head
Luckily it never got further than that, but I'm unaware of how it became deescalated
My grandmother, his wife, I've been told helped set up the first co-ed union for teachers
I've never had it confirmed by her, as she died before I knew, but the priest at the funeral talked about it during the necrology, and my father later confirmed it
Having known her, I can't say I'm surprised, as I'm aware that my grandfather's mother thought she was "a bad girl" and told my grandfather not to date a "wild girl like that", as she drove a motorbike and had very short hair
Her sister had also had to leave Denmark, after falling in love with, and marrying, a German man
So I think that might not have helped her case
I'm also aware that through my grandfather, I'm related to a man who prosecuted so many witches, that he was 'honoured' in his local church, by having his name written on a bench with thanks for "service to the cross", so
yay
Both grandfathers was part of the rebellion again the german occupation during WWII
Grandfather on mothers side never said much about it but on his chest was to big knife scars from a run in with Gestapo
Grandfather on fathers side was helping distribute illegal papers and documents
None, but the Roman Empire never really got all the way up to Denmark as far as I know
Never, why would we even do that
Traveling by train
Long, pedestrian-only shopping streets
I remember as an exchange student, gaining a bit of weight and how hard it was, not to eat something processed, cheesy or sugary
Like: Just give me some vegetables
Like a zucchini, a carrot or something basic healthy
**Home Cooking and easy healthy options**, was most certainly rare in the US
Like: What constitutes a healthy meal, seems to be very different
And maybe it's because the lobbies, have completely destroyed what constitutes healthy
Like "food" as high school was nothing less than sugar and fats
How's anyone going to focus after eating that
We got so much pizza, all the time
Like, don't get me wrong, it's delicious
But I couldn't stop connecting it to the obesity for sure
Granted, this is 10 years ago
But yea
Eating kebab/shawama
How did people survive before kebab
Here in Denmark we have a ~150% tax on cars, so adding an automatic transmission is an extra $2000-$4500 on top of the price
Automatics are a luxury
Example:
2019 VW Golf 1,5 TSI EVO ACT BlueMotion (130 HP), 6 speed manual, Price: $39,091 (€35,253)
2019 VW Golf 1,5 TSI EVO ACT (150 HP), 7 speed DSG automatic, Price: $43,349 (€39,092)
Don't ask me why the automatic has an extra 20 horsepower with the same engine
I just compared the cheapest 2019 VW golf manual vs
automatic
I had the impression that while shopping streets are aplenty in big cities, pedestrian-only streets (like [Strøget] in Copenhagen) are quite rare
I don't remember New York having any pedestrian-only shopping streets at any rate
When I grew up he was super popular in both Norway and Denmark as well
Absolutely disgusting
Oooh, that looks good
We ship it to Malaysia, where they dump it in the ocean instead  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
Here you have to physically take them from under the counter and place them on the conveyor belt beforehand, and obviously pay for them if you want them
In Denmark, most drive-through restaurants call their drive-through *drive-in*, which in English, is a different type of service as far as I know
Other than that, I can't really come up with any 'misused' or 'fake' English words
Ofc the Germans have a word for it
We do the same in Danish
Actually the influence of English on our language make people put in spacing in words that should be a compound
And personally I've always been confused when words should be a compound in English and when they shouldn't. For example seawater and sea captain
> Actually the influence of English on our language make people put in spacing in words that should be a compound
Urgh
I hate to be a nazi of any kind, but seeing people not compound their words (especially in professional settings, or in official-style text, etc
) just grind me in all kinds of wrong ways
The golden rule is:
**If you can't decide then just divide
I don't have a a catchy sentence for Danish but it's the opposite
Yeah, English is real fast an loose with compound words
I don't think there's often any rhyme or reason to when you should make compound words or not
The best rule of thumb is, I think, when in doubt, don't compound
I wonder if that's where the Danish word "mobning", meaning "bullying", comes from
EDIT: Or, if you got it from us
I don't know how old the root is
Maybe vikings were very concerned about bullying in the workplace
You are right to be the nazi in this case
Unfortunately I think it's a losing battle
I agree
It really sucks, because having compound words is the best feature of our language, if you ask me
some time ago a new absence rule was introduced to danish gymnasiums that received nation-wide hate;
usually, if you were slightly late, you would get 50% absence, but it was changed to 100%. that means that if your bus/train was late or cancelled and/or you came late by a few minutes, in the system, you were never there for the entire period
otherwise I'm quite happy with it
tons of support and more focus on actual learning rather than memorising
When I went to school in the UK, I had no idea you guys had assemblies, and nobody thought to tell me . After a couple of weeks I got a very stern talking to from a teacher for missing all of them
Never in my life had a thought of a sixth form having assembly, much less so often
It sounded horrible
Which, after going to one, I learned that it indeed was
Relatable
So true, same in Denmark
Everyone here gets teached at the same level, unless you're part of a private school
I have no idea what this is
How old are you
I'm 30 and that stopped way before I was born i public schools AFAIK
wait, you don't? even at the humanities type of schools that's kind of a basic thing you have to learn
It still exists in some schools AFAIK, I applied for a job at one where they mentioned it
It was a comprensive school with both sixth form and younger grades - assembly was just done for all levels at the same time
Likely why we had it so often
Sadly for me, I was the only exchange student so they always noticed then I wasn't there
"Atheneskolen" is not a part of gathering gifted kids
It's not a part of any national program or anything you actually hear anything about (as far as I know), my brother and I are very gifted (4
0 GPAs) and I've never even heard of this being an option
There's a national program in gymnasium here despite this, gathering gifted "kids"; but with close to no difference towards actual academic level (The academy for gifted kids)
That's not obligatory in Denmark, but possible to select when part of the STX (Follow up on primary school) gymnasium here
we just have one thing called "mathematics", and the teacher takes you through all of the different aspects (we have the same subjects for one, two, or three years depending on what is obligatory and what your chosen studies are)
This ^ Atheneskolen is mainly just for people whose parents have enough resources to send them there, who then also happen to have fine grades
No way they ever even informed people about its existence, much less sought out students for it
isn't it kinda convoluted to divide the different aspects of mathematics
I mean, some of them overlap a lot
I've got a friend studying in the US at the moment; she says that the short, semester-long classes and focus on memorisation makes it hard to remember things in the long run
I can see how that would be a big problem when seperating subjects like you describe
in regards to breaks, danish students have 6 weeks in the summer, one in autumn, two-three in the winter, and several holidays spread in spring
I think there was a study done that showed that regardless of how long your holiday was, the effects wear off after a few days
as for maths, I'm a complete retard at it myself - some people are just better at it than others, and a good teacher can really make a difference too
it doesn't help that I work with chemistry, though
Every time I've been to Scotland I've had haggis at least once
It's not as offal as everyone says
I was really pleasantly surprised by Czech "Svíčková na smetaně". Not only was it great, it wasn't too expensive either
Haggis in Scotland, pierogi in Poland and lohikeitto in Finland - all three dishes I had never tried before, but all three of them tasted amazing
That reminds me of a bit from a Lee Mack comedy show, where he says that the French didn't want the Olympics to be held in London because "their food is shit".
He then goes on to say that no Frenchman will ever experience the pleasure of coming home to lunch as a 14 year old boy, thinking they'll just get beans on toast and then discover that "Hello, there's little sausages in there
It can be quite heavy, but after a long day of hiking in the highlands a solid meal is exactly what my body needs
Well, a few years after I tried it I heard from someone that in most restaurants in Scotland, what they call haggis is not really the haggis with intestines cooked in a sheep's stomach, but rather some meat dish made to taste sort of like the real deal
I don't know if this is true or not
Lohikeitto is amazing - and we tasted it right after a round of ice-fishing, so a bowl of soup was perfect
None, for the nation, we've only ever had this one
Oldest flag country here
North Sea empire, since it was literally one of the last flags before Dannebrog
Didn’t we have some trouble because of the Muhammad Drawings
That's not a flag
But they associated the flag with drawings or am i being stupid
Well they did go around burning it as a result, so I guess some people didn't like the flag
At parties we play a game we call “Dåse” (translated “can”), where 2 or more people compete against each other in breaking a can in half with their hands, in a karate-chop kinda way
It usually ends in a bloody hand and many regrets that day after as your hand will turn blue because of the repeated slamming into a table
We do that too
So many tables would just be filled with blood because of this game
Absolutely - when I went on an exchange to the UK, I taught the game to the friends I made at my Sixth Form
We would literally have to wipe the blood off tables, we were so brutal
By the end, half of my entire year walked around looking like they just had a fistfight
Honestly can't believe we did that to ourselves
Nope it's awkward as fuck
Wish people wouldn't put you on the spot to perform for them
Everyone knows it: “rød grød med fløde”
"download open source server-software til din computers harddisk"
hvad søren
"Rød grød med fløde" er da hvad vi siger, vi danske knejte
Røget ørred
What does it actually mean
"Wow, I can almost understand it
How dare you
Only Swedes can insult is in this way
Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberry
Røget ørred i Rødovre
We have a territorial dispute with Canada

> different interpretations of history
I don't think "Alexander the Great was a Slav" really counts as an "interpretation" of history
For hundreds of years we have been wanting at least Skåne back, but now you have ruined it, so let's just keep the borders were they are now
As a Dane, I can assure you, we are proud to own the heart of Canadian culture that is Hans Island
That's funny, because I actually heard that Axel Makkedønsen was Danish
Ludo, Uno and Matador
All great games
Not sure what are traditional board games
My family plays Bezzerwisser, Alias & Partners
Probably Aalborg and Esbjerg, our 4th and 5th biggest cites, since we do have smaller towns and cities such as Roskilde, Billund and even Jelling which are likely more known (at least outside of Europe)
Roskilde is due to the Roskilde Festival, as well as the viking ship museum
Billund is because they have our second largest Airport, as well as Legoland
Jelling has the famous Rune-stones placed by Harald Bluetooth
It is both Denmark's birthmark, as well as the story as to why Bluetooth is called Bluetooth (the connection via the internet)
There aren’t any big cities, at least not by European standards other than Copenhagen
Østrig-Ungarn - but it's also referred to as the Habsburg monarchy
"det østrig-ungarske rige" or "østrig-ungarn"
Østrig-Ungarn
Det fimsede cykelstyroverskæg emperium
Østrig-Ungarn
Det Østrig-Ungarske kejserrige/imperium
Similar in Danish: Østrig-Ungarn
We are extremely flat
Also, the weather is shit
The Danish constitution was established in 1849 and has been changed four times:
* 1866: The king and the largest landowners(Lords) get the right to more seats in the Landsting, which was one of the two chambers of the Folketing
* 1915: Women and servants get the right to vote
* 1920: Southern Jutland is returned to Denmark
The King cannot declare war or make peace without the consent Danish parliament
* 1953: The voting age is lowered, a conditional female succession to the throne is introduced and the Landsting is dissolved, so that Denmark gets a one-chamber system with the Folketing as the only national representative assembly
Our constitution is from 1849 and has been changed 4 times
It is not easy to change the constitution in Denmark, it needs to go through 4 steps:
There needs to a majority of the Parliament (Folketinget) voting for the change
There needs to be an election for a new Parliament
The new parliament need a majority vote for the change
There needs to be a referendum where 40% of all eligible to vote has to vote in favor of the change
To change the constitution you need:
a) A majority in the parliament
B) Then a majority in the parliament after the next election
C) Then at most 6 months after the proposed change is voted for a public vote is held, where 40% must participate and a majority agree to change the constitution
It was also changed in 1855 after the three year war
Cus they assumed Denmark would be allowed to make Slesvig part of Denmark, so when we weren't, they had to change it
That's also the main reason it was changed in 1866
We lost Slesvig and Holsten completely
It was changed 5 times
It was changed in 1855 after the three year war
Cus they assumed Denmark would be allowed to make Slesvig part of Denmark, so when we weren't they had to change it
It was changed in 1866 because we lost Slesvig and Holsten completely
It was changed in 1915 when women and people who didn't own their place of residence were allowed to vote
It was changed in 1920 when we got North Slesvig (Sønderjylland) back
And it was changed in 1953, when Landstinget (a  second congress excusively for the wealthy) was abolished
They used that same opportunity to change the rules for inheriting the throne so a woman could become regent, thus making our Queen heir to the throne rather than just another princess, and the royal family also gave up the rest of their constitutional power
You're almost correct
To change the Danish constitution all of the following must happen:
* A majority of parlament must vote in favor of the proposed change
* An election to parlament must occur
* A majority of the newly elected parlament must vote in favor of the [exact same] proposed change
* At the latest, six months after the proposed change has been approved (twice) by parlament, it must be put to a public vote
The proposed change must pass by a majority, **and the majority must represent at least 40% of all eligible voters**
* The King/Queen must approve the law
(pure formality, but technically required for a law to pass
If he/she refuses to sign it, there's a separate procedure to follow, but that's out of the scope of this thread)

Ahhhh I see, didn’t read it carefully enough
[Egern]
The only consonant sound is N.
Egern - ˈeˀjʌn
Danish is pretty hard to learn so I don’t think non-native speakers would be able to pronounce it
The closest in English would be “eyern”
"Egern" No, just like any other danish word we don't pronounce half the letters, so with some help you most likely can but 100% that your first guess will be quite off

We put them in the fridge
Eggs have to be in the fridge in the supermarket
Rules from the Danish Ministry of Food and Environment states that eggs have to be stored and transported at 12 degrees C or below
In reality this means the supermarket keeps them int the fridge at 5 degrees C or less, as this is the temperature most other refrigerated goods has to be stored at
I don't know anyone who doesn't store them in the fridge at home
I keep them in the fridge because stores keep them refrigerated
Though I have recently been living with some family members who have chickens of their own, and they do not store the eggs from those in the fridge
I have heard that apparently in Denmark, eggs for commercial use are washed in aa way that removes some sort of natural protection that normally is on the outside of the shells, which would make sense to me
Eggs from the store have a practically squeaky clean texture compared to the homegrown eggs I've been eating lately, which have a more rough shell texture
But the whole washing thing could also just be a myth
I really don't know
I have never seen anyone store eggs elsewhere than the fridge
it depends how they're treated at the "factory"
in Denmark they are treated in such a way that they need to be stored in a fridge
in the Netherlands for example, they do NOT use this treatment at the factory, and thus the fridge is actually having the opposite effect
Store at room temp
I dont remember the details but i heard some professor explain why, on the radio a couple of years ago
something with condensation, after the treatment, requires them to be cool (to prevent condensation)'
If you're some random person with a chicken and you take an egg from that chicken, just store it on the counter or whatever
dont put it in the fridge
In Denmark they’re always refrigerated in-store

How to pronounce onsdag (Wednesday)
On the one hand, we have people pronouncing it on-s-dag (with a similar O sound to Odin) and on the other hand we have people pronouncing it ond-s-dag (with a similar O sound to evil)
Politics in Denmark as a whole are stupid and useless
I used to play videogames with a bunch of northerners once, and for about 2 years I thought they would actually go drink tea with their family whenever they said “gotta go, tea’s ready”.
The fact that they would sometimes use the same phrase when getting cup of tea didn’t help much
Soup
Hmpf
with *butter*?? do you *want* to get diabetes
You guys have pepernoten too
Yes
It's amazing, the butter mixed with the creaminess is a godsend, and I'll never apologize for loving it
My blood pressure just spiked
That's not pizza
It's a pie
But we are an Aldi North nation
It's just more pizza
I think they’re the same
We call them pebernødder though
Its extra spiked
Taste is subjective if course
But I certainly don't think so
That's not always a good thing
Lets fight
When has more pizza never been a good thing ??
Yeah
They’re reserved for December only
We'll send our navy, once we've bought weapons for it
Me too, I thought pebernødder were a Danish thing
Guess we have even more in common than I first thought lol
In my experience karaoke isn't very popular here
Although some songs that will always get people singing along, at least after a couple of beers, are what we call dansktop
The most popular ones include "Himmelhunden", "I en lille båd der gynger", "Hvorfor går Louise til bal".
"Hvor skal vi sove i nat" is probably most "karaoke-like" of the bunch
Train or car inside the country, unless you live in Aalborg and often commutes to Copenhagen then a plane ticket might be the better option (depending on time and money spent)
Most of Europe I would travel by car, I would only take trains as far as Hamburg or Berlin
I would take a car as far as Hungary, Croatia, most of northern Italy and Southern France, I would fly to Spain, fly to the UK, fly to southern Italy and Greece etc
Exactly
Unfortunately that night train to Prague is long gone
Yeah flying to Paris is cheaper for me than going by train just across Denmark
It’s so dumb
Until they stop making planes so much artificially cheaper I really don’t think it’s fair to scold the common person for choosing flying
It is
I truly love night trains
Luckily some of them are coming back, though I don’t think Prague is included in the plans for Copenhagen
Denmark similarly fucking hates it when we’re described as socialist
The Nordic countries are not socialist
Denmark is in fact one of the easiest countries bureaucratically to start a private business
Ever heard of MÆRSK, Ikea, Spotify, Lego, Nokia
Ah yes, those wonderful totally not capitalist companies
We just have welfare and unions
Both of which are
okay and I’m grateful for them but with various maaaaajor problems
Did you [try to google it
It's mainly based on stealing rightfully Danish land, being cunts and speaking weird
And of course IKEA
Exactly what a socialist would say
North Korea isn’t really socialist though, and definitely not democratically socialist
It’s really just as authoritarian as a country can be and this is due to their actual ideology, Juche, which preaches individual freedoms, but in reality the state just uses it to control the masses
In reality North Korea is just a monarchy, and it is extremely authoritarian making it difficult to even say wether it’s left or right leaning
Sure Kim Jong Un might not call himself a king, but he inherited the country from his father, and when he dies it will be one of his children or his sister who inherits it, which is how a monarchy functions
The only thing that’s sure is that it’s definitely not capitalistic, but that doesn’t automatically make it socialistic
North Korea has even attempted to distance itself from communism as they removed all mentions of the word in their constitution in 2009
The only good outcome of the whole *US deciding to misinterpret socialism* thing is super annoyed Danish right wing politicians having to explain Americans Denmark isn't socialist
> /u/Ap97567 a bit of background: he isn't introduced as such but Johan Norberg is considered somewhat of a liberal extremist in Sweden and has for a long time been employed by the Swedish industrialist union
His description of the last 150 years of Swedish history would be disputed by other people
I mean, it does say he's a fellow at the Cato Institute
Sure to non-Americans, that might not be very obvious, but the Cato Institute is a pretty well-known libertarian think-tank, so if you are just slightly politically interested, it should not be a hidden fact
It's certainly considered one of the reasons why
I would argue that one can't point to exactly one reason why the workers movement succeeded in Denmark in a way it didn't in many other countries
There are some key point one can point to - the overall public and political acceptance of unions, the Kanslergade agreement (often considered the biggest reason for the Nordic Models emergence), the great success of pro-workers literature, progressive labour market policies, and even our situations in World War Two
As it is, the unions hold so much power in Denmark, that we don't even have a minimum wage - we don't need to
They are probably the reason why we are able to sustain the Nordic Model, but not the sole reason why we even got it
Han refererer til Nordic countries
Interested in why you think it wouldn’t work just because you have larger population
I agree with you on most besides the last point - that unions are especially powerful in Denmark
I would rather say that they are influential as part of the institutions of the country
The three part model of employers, employees (represented through Unions) and the government means that there is relatively little work-related conflict, as all laws pertaining to working conditions are discussed with unions and employee organisations beforehand
In this sense, the "we are all in this together" is not only political rhetoric, but something reflected in actual practice
In this regard class consciousness in Denmark is relatively low, as collaboration rather than resistance is the key word
Unions in France tend to be more autonomous, assertive and political, hence the prevalence of strikes
In this sense unions in France might be more powerful, but not necessarily as influential as unions in Denmark
I am in no way religious but i still pay the church tax
It’s so little annually and i do like going to the graveyard to visit my grandparents etc, so church tax
Meh, it’s fine
That’s a fair point
Like I said it’s hard to really pinpoint their exact ideology beyond just being authoritarian, so I don’t disagree with that label
Yeah, the danish system and public very much depends on the unions being strong
My mum is rather high up in one of the biggest unions, and the amount of power they wield is crazy
They can basically fuck over the entire country if they wanted to - and most would support them
At the 2018 negotiations between state workers and the regions, 500
000 public employee went on strike from March until June and even by the end, most Danes supported them doing so
For us unions are seen as integral and something you basically have to be a member of no matter what
Out of 2,7 million workers in Denmark, around 2,2 million of those are members of a union
Yes
That is the whole point of this model
And that is also why Nordic countries implement ways to regulate peoples health
In Denmark for example there is an extra tax on sugar
In Sweden alcohol is only sold in stateowned stores with high tax, and stuff like that
The government needs to take measures to keep the population healthy to keep spending down from hospitals
So if the US was to implement the Nordic model, you need the full package
Edit: and of course you have to drasticly raise taxes
But in the end you earn less, but you also spend less on various things like healthcare and education
It depends very much on the industry and the company you work for
I have never been a member of a union, and I don't think many of my colleagues are either
I have never worked for a company that negotiated salary or working conditions with a union anyway
We rely on the civil servents act (funktionærloven), which is also really good, giving us at least 5 weeks vacation and so on
Numbers of members are falling though and my cynical mind don't really see the youth being as big supporters of the unions as their peers
We have to cherish what we have
[The Julekalender - Støvledans]
cool :D
I think you would have to be a native speaker to know all the different meanings and ways you can use fuck and shit
And there are of course differences between native speakers from different countries
I guess I'm just fucked since I will never know that shit
Uhm
they know i paid the tax because the state can see who does and who doesnt
They deduct it from what i earn, every year
Ofc everyone can visit their dead family, i just dont mind paying a tiny tiny tax for this
And what prevents me from lying is being a decent and honest person
Nothing other than my own moral and ethics prevents me
They actually call themselves the **Democratic People's** Republic of Korea
Which is even sadder and funnier because it couldn't be further from the truth
Sure, but that doesn't really change the numbers
When there are 2,7 million workers in Denmark, and 2,2 of those are member of a union, then there's no doubt that being a member is the most common
Just because some people aren't, and that those often congregate in the same type of jobs and professions, doesn't mean that it isn't overall the most common thing
According to every single article I've been able to find, membership numbers are going up, though not by much
From 16 to 17 it went up by 0,40%, for example
I can nemt husk back when it first blev sendt in the fjernsyn
I haven't seen den i mange years, and selvom den er nostalgisk, så have it not aged so well
Your numbers indicate that 81,5% of workers are organized in a union, when I google it, I get numbers saying ~67%.
According to "Danmarks Statistik" the total membership count for all unions (including managers, academics and unions outside the main organization) is 1,868,332 as of 31/12/2020
So I think your numbers might be a bit old
Source:
Edit:
The numbers for "a-kasser" (unemployment insurance) is almost exactly 2,2 million (2,202,999), even though many unions also have unemployment insurance, there are also many that are independent
Well, [DST says something else] It has gone slightly up in the short term, but union participation today is nothing like in the days where the vast majority of the rights we have today were won
Indeed, my good sir
Why does it bother you that i dont give a shit about paying a very small amount in church taxes when im agnostic
I pay because i want to
Because even though i dont believe, i think some parts of religion are worth supporting
Because the internet
The church will know who paid and who didnt, and in the end they dont care cos everyone is welcome in our church
And i pay because i like the general message of jesus christ, to love one another
And i like to visit my deceased family
I got them from a 2018 article, though I concede the article might have had them wrong, seeing as DS says different
I do agree they are a more trustworthy source
That being said, according to DS the numbers are still going up
You know, thats an american thing
That doesnt happen here
we dont let churches inherit our money and shit
I guess you would easily be as baffled about how little money the church gets in donations, as we are with how much your churches get
Here, the danish church gets their money from the state, and compared to usa, that is just a small allowance
Good thing we are not catholics in my country then
And i said churches in my country do NOT inherit money
You probably can, but people dont
I have seen elder care homes recieve large inheritances, but not the church
No, but you do have people donating their money to, tbh, ridiculous shit like tv evangelicans or an obviously corrupt, luckily, ex president
That sounds exactly like something a bad guy with an awful language would say
My Greek Wedding
Well, if the saying that you never forget to ride a bike once you've learned it is true, then I *can* do it, but I won't do it and haven't done it for the last 15 years or so
I hate biking - I can't really explain why, but I just think it's really uncomfortable and I feel like I'm constantly close to falling over - so I have only ever done it when my parents forced me to (and at a couple of school exercise days where it was also mandatory)
I seem to remember I was 5 when I learned it
Edit as I missed your last question: I don't think I know anyone who have never learned to ride a bike
That would be *extremely* unusual here
One of the mandary school bike trips I mention took place in kindergarten where we were around 6 years old
So yeah, they expected everyone to have learned it by that age
I think I was 5
Everybody I know, knows how to bike
But I'm a Dane, so I'd be surpriced if I knew somebody who didn't know how to ride a bike
Yes though I learned it pretty late at around 7
4 years old
i got a bike as a birthday present when i was 4
a few days later i had learned it
We had a 16/17 years exchange student from France over as well
We just assumed she would be able to bike
she wasn’t. It was not a good experience when we put her on a bike
I’ve never seen a 17 year who wasn’t able to bike before here in Denmark
Like I’ve been put on a bike since I was three or something
We bike almost everywhere
I think I was around 7
But before that I had ridden kids' bicycles with supporting side wheels
I don't remember when i learned to ride but my four year-old nephew just did
I have never in my life met an adult who did not know how to ride a bike
To me learning to ride a bike is like learning to tie you're shoes
It's just part of a normal upbringing
Same for me too xD
I've never thought that people can't ride their bicycles, especially because i cycle 15+km daily
> I know the Danes sometimes call us mountain monkeys, "fjeldaber"
It's not a particularly nice thing to say, so it's mostly used by tabloids whenever there's something sport related about Norway
In Denmark we call them ikea fags
No offense (Unless u swedish)
Skovperkere
Feel free to use it
Of course
We were mostly taught about the Holocaust, and how the war affected Denmark
My class went to Berlin and visited a concentration camp, and also the Jewish monument next to Brandenburger Tor
We're basically taught that our soldiers fought their absolute hardest, but recognised that they were fighting a losing battle
The anniversary of the invasion on the 9th of April is known as "The day of the Siege" and the anniversary of the liberation on the 4th of May is known as "liberation day".
We're taught that the Danish army had the wisdom to know a losing battle and to surrender for the sake of less blood shed
Of course this doesn't mean that there wasn't a huge underground resistance in the years to come
My own grandmother was even part of it, and can still recall shocking and traumatising events from her childhood about living in the resistance
Viking
We were vikings
So ofcourse we're romanticiseing it

Chicken is by far the most popular but the traditional christmas dinner does include stuffed duck
Exactly the same here
We just spell it Mortensaften
For Christmas many families eat duck as well, although pork is just as common
Also fairly common to eat duck (some will rather have a goose) on mortens eve, the evening before mortens day in november
Oh I don't know anyone who celebrates that so I forgot
For Jutland, I would say Struer
Years of failed city planning
In Zealand, easily Brøndby Strand
Perhaps more a southern suburb than an actual city, but goddamn, you have to look far to find anything nearly as terrible
Long complexes of massive soviet looking apartment blocks, surrounded by apartment complexes that are basically ghettos
Aside from that, boring detached house areas with no charm whatsoever
Usually the areas around the coasts on eastern Zealand are very attractive and expensive, but Brøndby Strand is an utter nightmare
&#x200B;
Vallensbæk, Ishøj and Hundige are the next suburbs when you drive south along the coast away from Copenhagen
While improvements, they as well are also not too charming, but after Hundige you sorta leave the Copenhagen area and get to Greve, Karlslunde and Solrød, which are very fine areas, and almost a complete 180 from the neighbouring areas
Not mock, no
I've been questioned about it several times, though - it sounds just Jutish enough that Copenhagener's find it quaint, but just Copenhagenish enough that Jutes find it foreign
The fact that one of my parents is a foreigner only adds a layer to it
In general, though, it's not a strong accent - Rigsdansk with noticeable traces of something else, but not noticeable enough to pin-point what it is
My English accent is similar; It doesn't sound non-native, but it also doesn't sound particular to any one place
Brits think it sounds American, Americans think it sounds British
I just refer to it as "Mid-Atlantic"
I like to make fun of the capital's accent, but the real outlier is actually my specific accent
All the time
I love it
I have a very strong Vendelbo accent, which is like a farmers accent
My friends from the city like to make fun of it but always in a playful manner, never malicious
I like it, because it makes me feel special that i grew up on a farm while they grew up in the city
There are a lot of Danish dialects, I'm just lucky to be from one of the less notable ones
There's is a lot of mockery between the different dialects though
I'm from the eastern part of Central Jutland so I absolutely have a dialect like everyone else in the country
It's not one of the dialects that others generally have a problem understanding though, it's just a *very* flat and uneventful dialect
There's absolutely no "fun" about it
There's no "melody" to it *at all* and there's no big ups and downs in tone or anything
There's not even a weird tendency to add "soft D" sounds to every word like they have in Copenhagen
Hotels
com did a survey about Danish dialects some years ago where they asked Danes about the most beautiful dialect, the ugliest dialect and the dialect that's easiest to understand
The Copenhagen dialect was easy to understand but the ugliest one as well according to the results for example
My "Midtjylland" (Middle/Central Jutland) dialect is one of the easiest to understand, middle of the road in "beauty" and the least ugly
It's simply that it's such a "neutral" dialect I think
It's hard to really hate it and there's nothing that really stands out enough about it to make it particularly beautiful either
So while it's not particularly beautiful it's so "neutral" that no one really voted for it as the ugliest one either
In a sense you could argue that it's the most "basic" way of speaking Danish I suppose
Just flat mumbling without anything in particular going on
So no, I don't get mocked for it
People in Copenhagen or whatever may comment on it being "jysk" (from Jutland) if I'm the only one in a group that isn't from Copenhagen or whatever but they have no problem understanding it
Ligge/lægge (laying) and sidde/sætte (sitting) are common grammatical mistakes
Basically, the i-form is used for when you're already in position
You "ligger" in bed, and you "sidder" in a chair
The æ-form is used when you're *doing* something
You "lægger" a pencil on a table, and you "sætter" the chair down unto the ground
When people use the wrong article in spoken Danish
Unfortunately we do not have any specific rules for when we use en or et - we just have to remember it :) It is easier in English: a or an, or German: ein, eine, ein :)
And there are even words, where Danes cannot agree:
En/et hamster (a hamster)
En/et gummi (a rubber)
Or words where the word have a different meaning:
En vår (one spring)
Et vår (one cover)
Oh and en/et is also the word for then number one
nutids-r (present -r), which is adding an r after verbs when they are in present tense
then there is making spaces between compound words
this is especially common among people on their phones a lot, as phone autocorrect doesn't seem to know that the nouns have to be together
Yeah, it's about the same
However, for example sætte would also be used for yourself, so while in English you'd say "I sit on the chair" and "I'll sit down on the chair", in Danish you'd say "I sidder on the chair" (Jeg sidder på stolen) and "I sætter me on the chair" (Jeg sætter mig på stolen), so there are subtle differences
I'm guessing it's very similar to German though
Here it varies a lot I think - it is not required by law, but depends on the company, school and union you are affiliated with
I have an internship coming up as a part of my education and was told that I shouldn't count on getting paid, by other students and my union
I was lucky enough to get a paid internship, but otherwise I would just get my SU (monthly student grant) and the company would just cover any transportation costs, which I guess might be less of an incentive for companies to pay students, as you can survive without
I feel like a common denominator for paid ones, when I was looking at internship ads, was the size of the company
Only the really large companies (like Nestle) were paid
I graduated from business school and never heard of a paid internship
On the other hand most of us had well payed student positions
When you live in another EU country you are to be treated as any other citizen with all which that entails
Related to this EU agreement is also a law that states that member countries needs to treat other EU citizens in their country on the same level as their own citizens
So in your example, if Italy would provide social security and pension to their own citizens, then they should do the same for the Belgian man
Though, you often see some national rules bending this a bit, where one need to do something to qualify for the benefit that the national citizens doesn't need to do
Absolutely unnecessary

Always come back to the non-translation of "Die Hard: With a Vengeance" to "Die Hard: Mega Hard".
Translated into stupider English
The RomCom, Friends with Benefits, is translated to "Bollevenner" in Danish, which essentially transforms it from a fairly innocent-sounding euphemism to basically being called "Fuck Buddies".
Not quite answering the question, but the Danish subtitles for "Yippie ki yeah motherfucker" in Die Hard was hilariously translated to "Goodbye, brother Shit", brother Shit being a really 1980s specific curse word
It just has the completely wrong vibe and sounds hella formal
Well, the British (Comedy
) film "Keeping Mum" was translated to "Svigermor(d)" which is difficult to translate directly back into english for you guys, but "svigermor" translates to "mother-in-law" and "mord" translates to "Murder
" So it's a bit of a silly pun I always found kinda funny
The second Hobbit movie, the Desolation of Smaug, was translated into Danish as *Dragen Smaugs Ødemark*, which is literally "The Dragon Smaug's wasteland". It always struck me as such a weird thing - for one, it's an incredibly prosaic and wordy title, but why did they need to specify that Smaug was, in fact, a dragon
Like who is going into the second movie in this series going "wait, who is this Smaug guy and why does he have a wasteland
The movie Basketball Diaries was "translated" to The Streets of New York in Denmark
I remember the subtitles in Die hard on tv translating the epic phrase "Yippie-Ki-Yay MotherFucker
" To "Yippie-Ki-Yay bror lort" which means (Yippie-Ki-Yay shit brother)
Swearing was odd in older subtitles - like how it was decided that "pikansjos" (dick anchovie) should be the standard Danish swear word in films even though it's very niche and seldom used in real life
Well, "bror lort" was slang at the time
I remember it being used in the early 90's.
Yes, it means the same thing, but one is a euphemism while the other is very literal about saying it
The English title is a euphemism while the Danish title is very literal in its meaning
Lol yeah that's true, subtitles always seemed much more colourful than our actual swearing vocabulary
Here it's called De Skøre Riddere which means The Crazy (or Silly) Knights
Haha

Got punched in the face by a British guy in southern Spain
Got stolen my bag with my computer in it while biking and leaving it in the back basket
Being robbed while biking is quite common in Copenhagen
I have had a few bikes stolen and was shot in the head with an airgun
Because a friend of mine threw a snowball through the shooters window
The shooter threw a snowball first
I guess he was mad that he missed, and my friend did not
EDIT:  And also a break in in our house once, an in our car another time
And someone stole my phone in a changing room once
It seems like getting hit while in Spain is a universal experience
Huh, didn’t know that
The majority of Danish songs I listen to are guilty pleasures lol
Denmark has a giant “bad music” industry, we were behind both Barbie Girl and Uh ih uh ah ah and ai ai ai I’m your little butterfly
For modern songs I’d say [Niklas] [Icekiid] [Kidd] [Nik og Jay] and [Benny Jamz] are some good places to start
In the reaaally obscure category are people like [Lille Heroin] [Pattesutter] and [Jesu Brødre] but I’d say they require some Danish knowledge
Don't forget our "Overly explicit music for no reason" phase back in the 2000's. Sol over Gudhjem by Torrpedorr etc
Nik og Jay - [En Dag Tilbage]
I’d say Tessa, Pattesutter and Suspekt fills that niche quite well today
I don’t really feel like it counts because it’s literally a children’s song
Oh of course, how could I forget him
They are not ubiquitous
I've mainly seen them in older office buildings/schools and such
In people's houses [these] are by far the most common type
Not uniquituous in Denmark at all
Most houses just have ordinary ones that open to the side, while apartments abd such will typically have the ones that open up/outwards
I have only seen windows like the ones in your link once
They're only common in apartment buildings here
I've never seen a house with them
In Denmark those windows are uncommon in houses, where windows will generally open outwards
But in apartments and multi-storey buildings where windows often are inward opening (to facilitate cleaning without the use of ladders)  they are pretty much the norm
It obviously varies with the age of the building, with the price of the building etc
but you can get all sorts of "super advanced" windows
Those windows aren't particularly "crazy" or whatever
Here's another "super advanced" window from the Danish company Velux: [This Window Transforms Into A Balcony with The Touch of A Button]
Windows in houses are generally outward opening, but in muti-storey buildings, it is common to mount inward opening windows, so they can be cleaned on both sides without using a ladder
They are not used that much in Scandinavia either
That's a Danish murermestervilla if I ever saw one
Yeah that's right
But I think in older apartment buildings you still opt for the outward type because of their design
Like this [one]
I actually do it myself hanging out the window - slightly dangerous
Most people hire a guy to do it
They usually come with a lift, although sometimes they also use ladders
It's quite cheap compared to other services in Denmark - most people probably do it (have someone else do it) once or twice per year
Yes, if they are built before the war, then definitely
But already in the 50'ies sliding windows had become common
Yes
I lived in a dorm from the 50s where you could open windows both horizontally and vertically
Now I live in a building from the 1910s with new old-style windows

It's very common here, both between men and women when you meet someone you don't know, or in formal settings of course
If it's someone you already know it depends on how well you know them, whether or not you shake hands or exchange a hug
Fun fact: Last year (or the year before, if I don't remember correctly) there was a bit of a controversial law passed that stated that when you're attending the ceremony, which grants you danish citizenship, you have to shake hands with the attending public servant, who hands you the official declaration
The argument was that it is part of being "danish" to shake hands, regardless of your background or believes
I'm not a fan of that law myself, but the law sparked a big discussion of the meaning of a handshake
Guys here will often do a handshake when they go their separate ways, and also often when meeting
Look, it's just too intimate for a Scandinavian to hug another man when meeting him
We might short-circuit and catch on fire
>If it's someone you already know it depends on how well you know them, whether or not you shake hands or exchange a hug
Or just a "Hey
" or just a friendly "punch" on the shoulder or whatever if it's a close friend you see all the time
Having to shake hands or hug your close friend that you see nearly every day would feel weird to me
He'd likely just get a "Hey <name or nickname>!" and nothing else
Same with colleagues you see every day really, they'd just get a "Good morning
:)" when I entered the office (or wherever we work in this fictional example) in the morning
If there was a new guy in the office he'd get a handshake though, just to introduce myself etc
I find a handshake very formal and "cold" unless it's during an introduction, and hugging all your colleagues would just be weird
I think it also depends on the situation to some extent
If it's a close friend who drops by all the time he may just get a "Hey
" when he shows up for the 5th time that week, but if it's a friend you see less often who shows up to your yearly Christmas party or whatever, he'd be more likely get a hug
The more informal the setting and relationship is the less likely it is that I'll shake hands with them
And if we're into the "Hugging stage" of knowing each other, the more often we see each other the less likely it is I'll give them a hug I think
I don't mind hugging though so if a person goes in for a hug I'll just hug them back
It would just feel weird to me if I had to hug the same close friend every day
>  If it's someone you already know it depends on how well you know them, whether or not you shake hands or exchange a hug
Yup
If it's close friends you get/give a hug instead - regardless of gender
> The argument was that it is part of being "danish" to shake hands, regardless of your background or believes
I mean that makes sense
If you're a muslim man who refuses to shake hands with a Danish woman, that's any sort of danish culture test failed right there
Hard to think of a more radically non-danish position
I actually love the "handshake + one arm hug thing" it's not as intimate as a hug, but at the same time is less formal than a handshake alone
Cats, but unfortunately I feel like in Denmark it is often a one-sided battle
Cat people most often respect dog people but it's not always dog people respect cat people
Because unfortunately some people don't believe cats should be considered pets
I know it's a very small minority, but they are prevalent
Ironically it's often the people who complain about cats that starts the problems
Often farmers who don't sterilise their cats and then dump them in town, creating problems
Total cat person
I think my country is probably 50/50
A while ago I believe there was a survey that proved worldwide people preferred dogs so probably dogs
By "most often" I meant pretty much always
I don't know any people with cats who dislikes dogs
In Denmark we have a "Dog law" which is there to prevent wild dogs and other dog breeding related causes to control the dog population
It also includes you have to break if a dog runs in front of your car (IIRC)
But on the other hand we don't have a cat law that should prevent the same things, which I think is stupid
And it's almost always farmers and a few people who don't got the money to sterilise their cats, that keeps these problems flowing
We have unfortunately seen more and more cats from the wild coming into facilities due to there being no law to prevent people from dumping kittens
All of this unfortunately also leads to some dog owners feeling superior as cats doesn't have the same law as dogs
Edit: Sorry for the little rant, but this is something that means quite a lot to me as my mother and I are actively trying to reduce the wild cat population in our town with as many cats surviving as possible
Don't know if it counts but we have really heavy dialects that can be very hard if not almost impossible if you aren't from that part of the country
Vendelbomål and sønderjysk is very different from "rigsdansk".
Have you seen how big it is
And that it's made out of a gajillion islands, with one of them being the western half of Papua
The German-speaking regions come from the former Prussian Rhine Province which *you* annexed following WW1, so quite the opposite in fact
It's not the only factor, but distance helps isolating people, making it possible for different languages to develop
More importantly is that it's consisting of a lot of islands with jungles, mountains and other kind of tough terrain, that are spread out over a vast distance, there are over 5000 km between the westernmost and easternmost point of Indonesia
Russia on the other hand is mostly steppes, where vast distances can be covered on horseback
Edit: Also I added that the Western half of Papua is part of Indonesia, where they have like 250(there are over a thousand on the entire island) of the 700 languages in Indonesia
DLF Seeds A/S is a danish company that sells about 30% of the worlds " forage and turf seed" - grass, mostly for either sporting locations or animal gracing
Most of this is for other companies, but they do also sell a bit directly to customers under different names like turfline, or Johnsons Lawn Seed
There major customers are other companies like farms or the  UEFA Champions League
They also sell a large share of vegetable seed like beet seed and that sort of thing
Hartmann A/S
They produce egg trays from recycled paper
The customers are businesses, which fill the the trays with eggs and then distribute them to retailers
ISS is a huge Danish "facility management" provder (they do cleaning etc)
They have around 500,000 employees worldwide and thus one of the largest companies in the world measuered by number of employees
Maersk is the largest container shipping company in the world
there's 5
8 km to my work place - i use an electric scooter to get there
takes 13-15 minutes
and there's 3 different busses going from near my home - and one to my work place
i do live in a larger city in my country
I'd say in Denmark it depends on the city
I grew up a place where the busses only came twice an hour, and we were quite far from the city center, so if I'd stayed there, I'd likely need one (my older brother stayed and got a car the minute he could afford to)
However, I now live in Copenhagen and here you can go your whole life without getting a car, or even a driver's license
There's a bus stop two minutes from my apartment with a bus that comes every 5 minutes and a newly implemented line that shows every 3 or so
I'm 7 minutes from the nearest city-train station, where trains to all over the city and city around it, comes every 5 minutes
And as of a few weeks ago, I'm 15 minutes from the new metro line, which gives me easy access to everywhere in Copenhagen
You have to run in front of a car with a flag, to Warn people of it coming
as a driver, you ALWAYS have to stop at a crosswalk
Happens 1/10 times
It’s illegal to refuse to give someone a glass of water if they show up to your door and ask you for it
Passer ikke
§ 27 Stk
Kørende, som nærmer sig et fodgængerfelt, der ikke er reguleret, skal afpasse hastigheden således, at der ikke opstår fare eller ulempe for gående, som befinder sig i feltet eller er på vej ud i dette

Its a redudant law
And these tend to stay in the law books in Denmark
So there are a few Odd laws that over time have been replaced with others but they stay because they were the basis for the later more modern laws
Wooops
Welp
The Balkans are like Scandinavia - it is a geopolitical region, meaning that geography matters, but ultimately, the question of who is and isn't is more a matter of culture
The viking era is pretty blurry because Vikings fucking sucked at writing anything down
A lot of the “evidence” are from the Christian crusaders, especially descriptions of Norse mythology
In my city there is a castle from 1600s with crown jewels in the basement
It says a lot about the kings power and lifestyle
The same king also built the old stock exchange and a big observatorium
There are old houses from 1600-1800s still used as apartments, the building i live in is from 1801
This tells us something about how the rich and poor lived
On many houses they have hung up a sign if a famous/influential person lived there
There are still remants of the old city wall/fortress tells us something about how the city has grown, wars, our enemies, military history, kings
Theres a very overlooked ruin of a tower part of medieval fortification in the middle of busy intersection
There are old warehouses at the habor where they would store imports, among other sugar and tobacco from terroritories in the west indies which tells us something about slave trade, international trade etc
Also beautiful houses of those who profitted from this can be found around the city
On several occasions they had to stop the digging for the metro because they stumbled upon new artificats
In Jutland you have a lot of remains of the the old bunkers the Germans built as part of the Atlantic Wall during WW2
There is also the most important stones of all the Jellinge stones from the 10th century which in viking runes tells the story of how Denmark became a nation and how we went from Pagans to Christians
I've been watching all the old Time Team episodes lately, and it had never previously occurred to me that the Romans were in Britain for 400 years
I had somehow got the impression that it was a century of occupation, tops
Watching the programme, it seems like every field in the UK is chock-a-block with Samian ware and tesserae
I’ve not heard of this
Europe is so densely populated (746 million vs 328 million) and with much less wilderness than the US
There’s not really any true undisturbed wilderness in Denmark
But there are buildings from 1500, 1600 that are still being used for apartments, stores and other utilitarian purposes
Also a few from 1400
It’s kind of normal to me in my own city, but in other cities and countries I’m in awe
Sounds like the west coast of Jutland
Bunkers everywhere
(ETA: I took [this] picture at the beach a couple of years ago
Yeah, I've been actively avoiding the newest series
Besides, in the really old episodes, you get to hear Tony carefully explain to viewers what GPS is
Endearing, yet hilarious
It's a fantastic show, definitely
I have a Rejsekort (literally "travel card", which I hold up against a chip reader when I board or exit a train or bus
It automatically calculates the price when I scan it while exiting the vehicle
The Rejsekort has an account that I can deposit money into online, via an app, or via machines or even clerks at most train stations
Rejsekort (travel card) or by mobile, i usually use the mobile
I don't think cash is accepted anymore, and I never carry cash anyway
I'm a student, so unlike the other Danes in here (that I've seen) I don't use Rejsekort
For students like me, there's an option called Ungdomskort, which allows you to travel for "free" everywhere within zone 1 to zone 99 (so basically all of Zealand), if you pay around 650kr per month, and then you also get cheaper tickets for the rest of the country
Some students elect not to have it, because maybe they aren't at Uni very often, or in general, don't use public transport
But for me it's perfect
Especially because of the money I save on other tickets, since my parents live in another part of the country
You can also buy a ticket for cash on the bus/train station, or via app
I just want to make it clear that isn't available all over the country
Some of us are forced to still use paper tickets (Klippekort kan rende mig i røven)
When I'm in London I usually just tap my bank card, and I think there's this daily top up or something so I don't get charged over a certain amount
SMS
Please elaborate aha
Do you mean the rejsekort scanners at Hyllie, Triangeln and Malmø C?
With rejsekort you get a discount for traveling outside rush hour
That is maybe what you are referring to
Where isn't it available
Except for Northern Jutland and Bornholm, I have been pretty much all over the country with my rejsekort the last couple of years
If your journey is done, you tap the card against the checkout reader
If you're going on another bus or train, you don't check out, you just check in  on the other bus (so the system knows you have changed bus)
Normal tickets are about twice as expensive
30 day tickets are a little cheaper, but only if you have to commute almost every weekday for those 30 days
Those two places mainly, yeah
That sounds interesting, but at the same time slightly complicated
Also, that is so fucking cheap wth
Here I think the cheapest fare(like in town) is like €2
In Denmark we usually say smil (smile) or appelsin (orange fruit)
Kamelpis (camel piss) is sometimes said to make the subjects laugh, but it's generally not used with small kids
Appelsiiin (Appelsin - Orange)
The "siiin" at the end seals the deal
In Denmark, most people would just say the Danish word for "smile" which is quite serendipitous
That or appelsin (oranges)
Yeah, Denmark too
Don't confuse us with the Dutch
That happens all the time
And for the love of god, don't ask if Denmark is in Sweden
[Oh yeah you’re socialist, right
I find the “utopia” ones flattering but also a bit annoying
And you know, wrong
I’ve seen people legitimately shocked that we still have murders, bad parts of town, people losing their jobs, people struggling with the system, homelessness
I guess the "Do you have a knife on you
" question must be one of worst ones
Yeah
sorry about all those stupid Danish teenagers going there to party and make a mess
I would be much more interested in going to Uherský Brod and visit the CZ factory
As a Dane I will still get "Peter Schmeichel" and "Brian / Michael Laudrup" when traveling
We really need to start upping our game
Laudrup
Schmeichel
Eriksen
The footballer callout is the worst
Why i oughta
TIL Dutch people are Lamas
Yes, but the Dutch shares this weird "potato in mouth"-ish speech pattern with us
One of the first time I was in the Netherlands I could never tell Dutch and Danish speech apart on distance
Yes
Which is understandable to some extent
Both share weird distinct speech, both are flat, both are famous for windmills (wind turbines for Denmark), both have bikes everywhere, and both are kingdoms as well
I'm sure you can draw even more comparisons
Tbf i've only experienced it with Americans and one English lady
A lot of Americans though
Good one
I remember at some point Finland used to be the butt of all jokes along with Sweden in Denmark, but now it's just Sweden
Wow
Easy now
There's no need to take it that far
You have so much to live for
Fun fact: Some Danes and Dutch share the same English accent
I've experienced this weird anomaly a few times
Once online I fully thought the guy I was speaking to was Danish because of his accent, turned out he was Dutch
I think our poor Belgian friend must have hit his head
There is a reason you have never heard anyone say Swedish was nice sounding :P
Since both the Danish, Finnish and Norwegians all seem to hate you guys
have you ever asked yourself this question
Okay, I admit that skånska sounds ok I guess
And can't we agree that Dutch is the worst
The chance that someone joins is not low (there’s a good chance)
What are you talking about
Danes are the nicest people in the world
Extremely cool and down to earth, while also being back to back world champions in the best sport on the planet (handball, which we incidentally invented)
Oh, and very humble as well, you won't find anyone as modest as us :-)
Here in Denmark a luxury hotel for dogs has recently opened
It offers spa and massage for dogs

Way too expensive
Many danish designed bikes are produced in Taiwan
I'd finally be able to speak properly
Fuck
Yeah, no
There's nothing else to eat
We eat them about every day
Everything would fall into anarchy within 24 hours and suicide rates would skyrocket
I think i'll be fine
I'll go with various kinds of other roots
is there potatoes in Döner
i've only heard about it in kebab/Döner boxes
Fuck you're right
But like this we have our secret language even we don't understand xx
Anything where a danish team is remotely close to winning
It rarely gets violent, but people go absolutely nuts over the most ridiculus sports they didn't even know existed
Mostly Handball, but that's only because we are world champions, and really good at it
Football is unique as it’s fan culture historically is so rooted in working class culture not only for entertainment but also as an emotional outlet
I cannot think of any other sport that has the ability to attract the scum of society in such large amounts as football
Can confirm
If a Dane is winning, I am a fan
It's always a good move to invent your own game when you are failling at everything else
Curling
'nuff said
I agree
Although I remember back in the 00s when Team Saxo Bank was one of the mastodonts of cycling and Danes were worshipping Bjarne Riis and the Schleck brothers
Until those greedy brothers decided to join the rival
We'd probably just try to get attention lmao
Until the beer and snaps arrives
I’m with norway on this one
-Denmark
We'd probably just drink too much beer at once, puke and then collapse
Is there a reference I’m missing here
And real life
when i was in school, all i ever heard about was WW2
WW2, is of course interesting
but we never heard about WW1, what caused WW1, and how it relates to WW2
And we also never heard anything about the vikings and the wars between denmark and sweden, and so on
kinda weird
I think I'd like to have learned the truth about Denmarks role as a slavenation
We basically learned that we had the west indies but I clearly remember it describe like we were "the good guys" and it was more a "cooperation", and then our "great king" made slavery illegal as the first country in the world
We weren't taught about that we treated our slaves just like any other slave nation, we were horrible and racist
Even once the "buying of slaves" were made illegal in 1792, it was still legal for 9 more years, and you could keep the slaves until 1848
This story is not at all like the one we heard in school ( let alone how the 10 year grace-period, made it a trend to mainly buy pregnant women and/or rape slave women, so you'd get "two generations out of one slave".)
Luckily its becoming a more common discourse in the public sphere atm, but two years ago when I was a temp at a local school, they were still using the book that taught us the "false story"
I never learned about the danish gold age, where everything sounded very idyllic and romantic, but where the danish state was essentially a brutal police state controlled by an autocratic monarch
an example is in our national anthem: part of it compares the king at the time (frederik the 6th) to a fictional hero of peace, but in reality his time of reign was full of some of Denmarks worst catastrophes (the english wars, state bankruptcy, the loss of Norway)
Vikings and not Columbus discovered 'Murica
That seems odd, I was taught all of those things and more, even before secondary school (gym)
WW2 we maybe spent half a year on in seventh grade, and then it was also mentioned here and there - but in general, we covered everything from Vikings to the fall of The Wall, and everything in between
This seemed to be the general thing both when I went to secondary with kids from different primary schools, as well as now that I study history at uni - we all basically were taught the same things in primary and secondary
Maybe it's just what you remember
I remember a lot about vikings,  the middle ages, a lot of reformation stuff, serfdom and the absolute monarchy and later industrialization and democracy, and Slevig/Holsten and modern history
WW1 is not as heavily taught in Denmark because of our neutrality I guess
EDIT: I would have liked to have learned more about the Thirty Years War
A monumental era in European history and an important part in the decline of DK as a European power
I've learned some stuff about vikings, a lot about ww2 and nothing about ww1
I took a year of history in sixth form in the UK and we also learned about the reformation in Europe (Martin Luther), in relation to the UKs split from the Roman Church with Henry the 8th
&#x200B;
(That being said I was surprised at how your history subject functioned
We had 2x2 lessons per week, one of the days dedicated to English monarchs and one to WW2
This was the entire year, very different from how we do it in Denmark)
hmm that's weird
We learned a lot about how we mistreated  them
Our teacher didn't teach much tho so we got some pages and then googled the rest
Odd, I'm taking my masters in history now and it's something thats discussed a lot in the topic, that we until recently didn't tell the truth to the broader public
It's mainly used as an example of bad sources leads to wrong history
Most of us here though, did go to school in the early 90s and early 00s though, I'm aware that we've gotten better at telling the story within the last 10ish years :)
ah yes, a man that both Norwegians and Danes can agree is great (not so sure about Sweden tho)
I'm aware, since I did choose to take it myself when I was on exchange ;)
My qualms aren't with the system or the structure (we also only had four history lessons during the week in our sixth form level in Denmark, though it was obligatory to take it for all 3 years we have sixth form, though sixth form sisn't obligatory in itself)
My surprise stemmed from the fact that you only covered to topics a year (and as far as I know continued with the same next year)
We'd normally cover between 6-8 topics per year in Denmark, sometimes more depending on the topic
I feel like thats a better approach
I'm unaware of school systems outside the Italian, German, Danish and UK, but all have around the same amount of compulsory education
Ours stop at around 15/16, same with German and Italy
Then you go to our version of Sixth Form if you want to - in the Danish, we might cover more events, but our history subject from around year 7, has an analytical approach (can't say with Germany and Italy, though)
So all in all, there are many broad similarities - it's in the details we differ
I'm aware I'm limited to my experiences with my school in the UK - however, I also have anecdotes from other exchange students that attended different schools in the area, one of which was a 14-year-old German girl attending primary, who told the group that she never did her homework because they only covered WW2 and her being German, well, they didn't exactly tell her anything new
That sentiment seemed to resonate amongst the other western European exchanges, no matter if they were in secondary or not
(My sixth form was also attached to a primary, and when we started (me and a different German girl, who dropped the class after a month because she learned nothing new from it), we were called to a meeting with our history teachers who explained their subjects would mainly be a continuation of what the had taught the student when they went to primary, as most had been here since they started primary, that being WW2 and the UK royal families)
None of what you describe above (analytical skills, wider political implications, ect
) was taught to us in the UK, the Luther reformation was mentioned because the teacher made the connection because I and the German girl was in the class (and the rest of the class assumed this Martin Luther was Martin Luther King, so we ended up spending some time on it)
We simply had two teachers standing at a board, telling us about historical events pertaining to their chosen event/subject matter
I might have drawn the short straw and attended a shitty school - who's to say
But as I mentioned, this was a subject we discussed amongst our group of exchange students attending schools in the city, and my school was not seen as an outlier
Maybe it's changed, it is after all about 9 years since I attended sixth form in the UK, but back then, in those schools, this was the reality
Ours is as well, but we switch up the subjects so we learn the history, while also learning analytical skills :)
That being said, maybe my school was shitty because we had zero focus on analytical skills
I basically just went into a room on mondays and listened for two hours to man talk about WW2, and then another room on thursday to listen to a woman talk about monarchs for two hours
Once in a while they'd show us a film, but other than that nothing else
The Crown but with the Danish Royal Family
Pilou Asbæk should play Prince Henrik
I’d like to see a show like Supernatural, but where they hunt mythical creatures all over Europe - not just Denmark
There’s plenty of folklore to draw inspiration from after all
Actually, it's the other way around
Survivor started getting developed in the UK in 1992 by Charlie Parson, it just wasn't ever aired
And then the concept was bought by STV and it aired in Sweden in 1997
They focus a lot on mythical creatures and folklore in the earlier seasons, and even though the show is pretty cheesy at times, it leans into it and becomes pretty meta which is great imo - if you don’t mind a bit if cheese it’s great
I don't know about the rape, but you're sweden, so that automatically makes you a hellhole
What % though
In Denmark autumn is the only season
Some people also have the misconception that denmark is a winter wonderland

Wait, is that the amount of the Bulgarian population comprised of Gypsies who steal TVs, or just Gypsies in general
the european union stands as number one in pharmaceutical export, with 51,2%. the US is country number two with a world market share of 11%.
Rocket enthusiast and submarine builder Peter Madsen is up there
Took a Swedish journalist for a ride in his submarine, only to [murder her and cut her to pieces] before dumping the body parts in the ocean and denying knowing anything about her disappearance
Seems a bit silly, prostitution should be legal and so
This only increases my respect for the Irish
He did indeed
If I remember correctly he had threatened a guard with a vest that looked like a bomb, only to be caught within 10 minutes
A very young danish girl did what twats always do
She wrote to him in prison, they became “great friends”, she had a rocket and his signature tattooed on her arm and whined in public about how her family didnt want shit to do with her after finding out
Few years later shes back in the public eye being all “i was so young and dumb”
And how stupid is that
If a woman wants to sell sex, why should anyone be against that
There was also disgusting things like "woman torture" and stuff like that in his search history
I know her personally
Camilla Kürstein
She was always pretty weird
Same
Regulation is the way
Kind of the same for me
However, the eyeopener was when I watched the music video for the first time lol
It is a thing, I was send to I think two in my entire childhood, but I wouldn’t call it a tradition
Our summer vacation is only six weeks long so it isn’t really needed
Every summer vacation we were handed this magazine with activities in our municipality, though
A few were camps but most were “come and paint for a day with some random adult that *might* be a teacher”.
My stepbothers (a couple of years younger than me) were sent to summer camps a couple of times in the 90s
it's not super common these days i think
But they still exist
they're not entirely like in the american movies though
They are usually just sports activities and such
I wouldn't call it tradition but it does exist
I was on several as a kid in end 90's and start 2000s
It varies a lot for me personally because I have some problems with tooth that I really slow and have to get x-rays done 3-5 times a year
But the average seems to be 2 checkups every year
Here in Denmark we often (always
) use a "traffic light" system that determines how often you need a checkup
Green = 1/yr, Yellow = 2/yr, Red = 3/yr, depending on the condition of your teeth
If the checkup reveals issues, you will have to schedule an additional visit
One thing to consider, is that dentist visits are 100% subsidized until you are 18 years where after you have to pay yourself
I know a lot of  people end up skipping these checkups and only visit the dentist when they have problems with their teeth
>My dentist sends me an SMS when a year has passed, and generally I can call and get an appointment for the next week (this year it was a longer wait as Corona caused dentist offices to close for months)
My dentist sends an SMS with the appointment already set
I have to call/SMS/Mail them if I want to set another time, but I have a flexible schedule, so I just let them book whatever time they like
I just wish they'd send a calendar invitation along, so I wouldn't have to type it in myself, but that's just me being lazy
It's the opposite
I would be surprised by anyone from another country being taught anything about Danish history at all
Well i dont know if other nations teach this but my own teachers never actually went over the viking era, or that Denmark rulled a huge part of England at some point
I bareley even know anything about Danelaw and the conqouring of large parts of Britain, and I'm Danish
About the HRE part i never heard about that in my school, i first learnt about it on yt
Well in Denmark you *mostly* don't need to calculate taxes so for that part out isn't so weird we aren't taught it
University history student here
The only aspects of Danish history I have heard mentioned are the Viking Age, The Kalmar Union, our role in the 30 Years War, though that may only be because we have a phase of it named after us, and the Great Northern War
That is still neglecting about 1100/1000 years of history
Here in Denmark we have to learn about Shakespeare if we take high school English at the highest level
I haven’t heard anything about the magna carta in school
I still know what it is, but that’s because I’m a nerd
I mean, of course since your history is so intertwined with ours
It's the same in Sweden, Norway and Iceland
I should add the caveat "countries that haven't at one point been part of the same country as Denmark".
I'm just happy to hear that you are taught that the danes also were vikings
> Well we learn a bit about you here, but I think it's mostly due to the fact that our historys are kinda related
Again, for roughly 500 years, Icelandic and Danish history was two sides of the same coin
>and we also learn Danish though it's widely considered one of the most boring subjects among students
But very useful, in case you want to go study in another Nordic country, which quite a few people do
Uhm
I don't think so
I, at least, didn't learn any Shakespeare in HTX
Depends on the teacher I think
My mother teaches english and she says Hamlet is a bit too long
She teaches Macbeth a lot
Romeo and Juliet also seems to be popular
Oh right, sorry
I’m at STX
I kinda forgot about HTX and all the rest
That much is clear ;) Finland isn't Scandinavian for starters
Vatican city and monaco are smaller
I have no idea, i find it kinda silly really haha
Vastly depends on which non-eu county
Danes are fairly sceptic
Not particularly friendly at all
I would say immigrants have a hard time integrating into Danish society, and even if they do, natives will never view immigrants as belonging in Danish society
To take it a step further, if one of your parents is Danish and the other one is say, Japanese or Ghanaian, but you were born and raised in Denmark with Danish citizenship, a lot of Danes will still not consider you 'one of us'.
If, however, the other parent is French or Austrian, there are usually no questions asked
Fine as long as they are not spreading Trump propaganda ;)
Got several american friends living here
Yeah, my father is Danish and my mother is not, and I’ve been explicitly told many times “don’t try to think you are Danish, because you aren’t”
Not at all
It's very racist
That's not a debate you even want to start, believe me
Oh, you, too
Fun, isn't it
Yes that is true
In general Danes are polite people but not very open
So it takes a lot to make a real danish friend
I myself is in a relationship with an expat and her main social circle is other expats, however there's a big community of internationals
Over at r/Denmark, a question like yours is very common
If you don't study with people, then the most common way to get friends is through work or joining something related to a hobby
This is true
I have a friend whose grandmother is Polish (so he has basically no relations to Poland at all), and he still gets called a Polak
I think you mean orthodox easter
The first of may is a holiday in most social-democratic, SF or Ø municipalities, but no it doesn’t transfer
It's not really common to know about Greece being orthodox unless you have been there
I would say most people knows Russia is orthodox, and of course Italy being catholic because of the pope and Vatican in Rome
Also Ireland and Spain are known to be catholic
I've visited south Italy (where it's close to Albania), and Scandinavia/Nordics are also very exotic to them
Usually shower every 2
day but alot of people shower every day and some shower less often
I take a shower, once every morning, every day
Now that I don't bike to school every day and therefore aren't getting sweaty, I shower every 4-5th day or when my hair feels dirty
I obviously still wash myself morning and evening, but I will only shower when my hair feels dirty
I shower every morning
I think that is the general consensus to shower once a day and then it is different from person to person wether they shower in the morning or in the evening
I think they mean that people sweat way more in warmer climates, and yeah I can see why you might wanna shower more often then
Even in Denmark I can totally feel the (pretty mild) difference between winter and summer
You are not weird
I sweat very little, and nobody notices if I skip a day or even two
Why in the name of Maria Teresa García Ramírez de Arroyo would you do that
That is an atrocity
We have never used anything else than a pizza cutter
yeah, I learned it from a friend, I have been these last 14 years
Copenhagen - typical capital stereotypes, elitist, ignorant, snobbish
Lolland - drug addiction, petty crime, post-industrial depression
Not very lol
Randers - trashy but in a more light-hearted way than Lolland
Nordsjælland - very rich people, snobbish
Sønderjylland - incest, Alabama-ish
But I’ve basically only heard it online
Fyn - as the middle island it’s just a road bump
Edit: Jylland in general - country people who hate Copenhagen with a burning passion
They like to view themselves as more down to Earth, but as a capital snob, I’m not so sure
We have almost the same in Denmark, in that everyone makes fun of the Copenhageners for being upthight and fancy, but somehow still socialist hippies
While they make fun of the rest of us by saying we're poor, incest loving, farmers
Has the Copenhageners finally realized, Jylland is the better place to be, or have they just forgotten about us
Jeg vil sige at Limfjordsregionen ude omkring Mors og Thisted er Danmarks Alabama
Også selvom det er noget nemmere at forstå hvad de siger
Being from Randers I can't say I've ever found the jokes about Randers more lighthearted than about Lolland  In fact for those 8 years I lived in Copenhagen I've met more people who actually believed all the jokes were true, than I've met people who joked about it lighthearted
It is danish yes
From Zealand
Some are making fun of Funen for just being a highway connecting Jutland and Zealand
I've never heard people make fun of Copenhageners being socialist hippies
In my expirence (being from Jylland, but having lived in Copenhagen for 8 years)
People say people from Copenhagen is mostly CBS people and banditter i habitter
Oh don’t worry we have a lot of jokes about you too
Just added one
What I find even funnier is people from Jylland thinking the entirety of Sjælland is Copenhagen
You’re right
In this case, it was because I only saw it popping up after those Alabama memes became popular
People do tend to forget about it, yes
Source: I forgot about it until I read your comment
Bornholm is mostly remembered as a tourist-spot
The notion that people actually *live* there, permanently, is a fact quite readily forgotten
"Old people actually interesting nature funny accent"
I’m sad to hear that
People can be so insensitive
“It was just one joke what’s the big deal” yeah, but if you hear them over and over again
Connecting Jutland and Sweden* ;)
Alle andre er socialist hippier når man Vestjyde
Yeah, I think the divide between rural and urban is pretty universal
Kildare is relatively close to Dublin, so you have the same kind of steriotypes about people from somewhere like Desmond
nono, we dont think that, we know sjæland is bigger
we just realize the whole thing about being from sjælland is a complete paralel to being from Jylland
we dont talk just to talk so often you guys do, as an example
over here everything is just way more down to earth
its some kinda culture to be somewhat proud to be from Jylland
if Denmark split in half, im sure it would be Jylland and Fyn vs Sjælland and the island
all in all its brotherly love
Literally did not go a week without hearing a Randers joke for all 8 years I lived there
By the end I had to frankly sit down with my friends and tell them that not only was I tried of all the jokes, it hurt my feelings since it seemed like they actually meant it when they said I was a lower-class criminal who only drank mokai
I've literally had people tell me how "different I was from all other people from Randers" and how "they were so surprised when they met me, since they thought I would be like the rest of the people from the town". Nevermind that Randers is consistently one of the cities in Denmark with the lowest amount of criminals per citizen, and the most middle class populace
I've had friends visit me in Randers and go: "omg it's actually a city" or "where are all the bums and crime
". Honestly in the end I stopped telling people where I came from, it got so bad
Zealand is the english spelling
In danish it's called Sjælland, which I can't really think of an obvious connection between those two forms
Maybe the answer lies in old norse
In modern danish the direct translation would be 'soul land'.
Måske, mit eneste tilhørte forhold til vest Jylland er mine bedsteforældre, der begge var socialister
Men det er i hvert fald ikke en stereotyp i Østjylland
Og jeg har heller ikke hørt den fra mine venner fra andre dele af Jylland, men det er naturligvis ikke ens betydning med at dem fra vest Jylland ikke har den stereotyp
Det var mere fordi du skrev 'everybody', og det var ikke lige noget jeg genkendte
Down to earth how
And it's interesting the "talk just to talk" thing, I saw that more in a small town in Jylland
If you mean smalltalk on the street, that is
I guess it's mostly just a small town vs city thing
Jeg er nordvest jyde
Næsten alle jeg kender gør det, men jeg tror egentlig mest det er fordi vi er lidt sure over at de har så mange penge derovre
I appreciate you taking the time to reply
Have a good day now :)
like everything is more rooted in reality
but i depends where you are ofc
small talk mainly, but i feel like copenhageners talk and talk and talk, when sometimes its okay to just be quiet
that is of course if said persons are friends, i dont think people just talk randomly to random people
uanset hvad, så er det selvfølgelig kun smag og behag
Do those movies feature trolls
>I think that the two cities would have been called the same
Copenhagen and Malmø together with the regions of Zealand, Scania and Halland have indeed today joined in the Greater Copenhagen metropolitan cooperation (previously known as the Øresund region)
Having been to Rome, Venice and Florence, going to Milan was a weird surprise
It felt much more Northern European, more specifically German, which would make sense
It was really nice though, this mix of Central European and Italian
Love that city
>Köpenhagen
Is that how you write Copenhagen/København in Finland
Halland has been part of Greater Copenhagen the past two years and Blekinge is expected to join soon

First time i ever saw Furries in Fursuits outside in real life was when i was in Moscow
I thought that was funny because Furries are usually stereotyped as the members all being homosexuals (Not that i'm saying that's true)

Bringing in cake and/or pastries when it's your birthday is standard
My boss also recently got married and brought in a cake
On Fridays, people get together and have a couple of beers or a gin & tonic after hours
Recently, different people have started bringing in cakes or other treats to share with everyone just as something nice for the team
Probably not strictly COVID compliant, but we're pretty good about hand washing/sanitizing, wearing masks, etc
On the non-cake or food side, I have yet to see anyone bring in a card for everyone to sign, but one colleague got a small flowering plant for her office when she came back from maternity leave
Oh yes, cake for any occasion
We also have friday bread, taking turns bringing in rundstykker (rolls) and such, for an informal meeting in the morning
Danish sounds horrible in most metal music, and therefore you won't find any metal sung in Danish that isn't underground, and therefore I'm gonna throw a curveball, because you need to have Al Namrood - Xenophobia in your playlist

Christian the 7th was litterally insane
So properly him
I came to write exactly this
He is notorious for just how insane he was
He succeeded his father, Frederick the V., who was a drunkard and had been neglectful of his duties himself
That left the court to be dominated by power struggles between the councillors who wanted to rule instead of the king
Christian was himself caught in this, as a child through the brutal upbringing by his noble tutor which only worsened his condition, and after he succeeded his father at the age of 17
He tried to govern in the beginning and was described as intelligent but immature and full of temperament
Being easily manipulated and having no grasp of his duties and the power struggles around him, he gave up on his duties
He would go into Copenhagen with his prostitute lover Støvlet-Katrine ('Bootie-Cathrine') and drink at the seedy pubs and brothels until the early morning
He would brawl with the local police force and come home in the morning with insignia and trinkets taken from the police force
There are also stories of him leapfrogging over foreign dignitaries, when they bowed to him
It's hilarious to read about, but it's really tragic at the same time
The Danish state was an absolute monarchy at the time, which meant he couldn't be declared insane and thus was forced to stay in power to keep up the power balance of the state and the court
Damn, I never heard about the masturbation part :/
Ludwig was not mad
He was declared mad by some of the nobles because they didn’t like how much money he was spending on fairy-tale castles
Which isn’t exactly smart, but he was as sane as anyone
He was primarily king of Belgium/King of Belgians or how they title themselves
The fact that he personally acquired Congo didn't change that
Hence "Wir wollen unseren alten Kaiser Wilhelm wieder haben"
> but in the shortest possible time to put the backward agrarian country on the rails of industrialization
By starving the people in Ukraine
Also, Russia was expected to industrialise rapidly by just about everybody dealing with global politics back around the turn of the last century
The fact that Russia would become an unbeatable industrial superpower in the very near future, was one of the primary reasons that Germany was so hooked on going to war in 1914, because they saw it as a now-or-never moment
I don't think Stalin deserves that much credit for it
> ...and in all of the rest republics
Ukraine was by far the hardest affected region, which to my knowledge, was also the only region, where the borders were shut, meaning the starving peasants were not allowed to flee
I remind you this happened in what is probably the most fertile agricultural region on earth, and one of the reasons for it happening was extremely tough quotas, that often didn't leave the farmers with enough seeds to both feed themselves, and plant enough crops for next year
>Some of these crimes were neccessary for progress of young countries
Miss me with that genocide apologia
If you try to alleviate a starvation, why do you restrict movement out of the affected territory
>But Ukrainian propaganda loves to use golodomor as an act of genocide by evil Russians
Because it was just totally a very convenient mismanagement of the territory with the 2nd biggest ethnic group, which weren't exactly positive about Moscow rule, that just happened to severely gimp said ethnic group
You can extend this to Kazakhstan as well, the famine was a move to quell dissidents among the Kazakhs
Crazy story
what a life
There’s no direct meaningful translation of “thank you” from Danish
We literally just say `tak` which means “thanks”.
Some might argue that `tak skal du/I have`, directly translated meaning “thank shall you(singularis)/you(pluralis) have”, would be it
But nah
tak - singular
takker - plural
> India
but don't india use shitty old planes from the 60s or something
I dont recall the model
but i read some news about an indian pilot out-flying a MIG and shot it down (during this indian vs pakistan thing earlier this year (or was it late 2018
they mentioned the jet the indian guy flew with and i googled it
didn't look like the MIG 21
it had a weirder nose
and iirc it was from the 60s (i guess it was newsworthy because the jet he used was inferior to the MIG he shot down)
i was wrong
it was a mig 21
he shot down a  F16 (while also getting shot

I always carry these 4 things with me everywhere I go: Phone, keys, pocket knife and my wallet with credit cards, emergency cash, drivers license, organ donor registration, misc membership cards and stuff like that
Other than that, things that are important to me includes:

Rye bread (and Danish liver pate with bacon
My guns (sports shooting is a very fun hobby)
Some family heirlooms, especially some wooden furniture and boxes that my deceased grandfather who was a very talented woodworker made
Pepsi Max
I know, it's not healthy, but I don't smoke, rarely drink alcohol or other unhealthy stuff
But I need my Pepsi Max
I don't use mine very often, but I am pretty sure everyone I know has one somewhere in their kitchen cabinets

Danish is a northen Germanic language, so
We Danes have the tradition of borrowing indiscriminately from other languages
Just see the English influence on Danish over the last 70 years
And we borrowed as indiscriminately from German for almost a thousand years
Depending on the type of text anywhere from 10-30 (in certain cases even 45)% of the words will be from German origin
Almost all words associated with the crafts (håndværk) are German words for instance
On the other hand
Before High German was introduced/enforced/suggested all the way to the border one could say there was an unbroken language-continuum between Danish and German
Dansk, Jysk, Sønderjysk, Sydslesvigsk, Platte, Tysk
In such a continuum, when is it exactly a loan
I looked it up, and thought it to be some sort of ham(because of schinke), and then I saw it was basically just a weird German way of saying "placintă".
Not that commen, but still something you see now and then
Nobody cares
On some men long hair looks really nice

Ahh ok
Makes sense
Just always wondered since I've only seen it from dutch speaking people
We executed 46 collaborators after the war
It has caused controversy since because death penalty was not a possible verdict untill a law was changed after the war
The controversy came from the fact that the offender's were judged for actions commited before the law was decided
We executed a lot of the more notorious ones, sadly
There’s a movie called “Under the sand” that shows what Danes did with Germans, it’s a pretty good movie in my opinion
> Women who slept with Germans were shaved in public
Also happened in Denmark
Yes, sadly
I do not believe a government should ever have the right to execute its own citizens, regardless of what their crime is
So I think it is sad that the government executed them
It should be noted, that the Danish government stayed in power for some years after the occupation, and actively encouraged the population to "work with the Germans", even to the extend of actively encouraging unemployed workers to take jobs in Germany or otherwise work for them
Government was dissolved in 1943, and the post-war government made an ex post facto law that banned working for the Germans
They basically said: "You should have known we didn't actually mean it when we told you to work for them
It was a dark time for justice in Denmark
Agreed, which I think most Danes would
Likely that's why it's somerhing we don't talk much about
The execution place is rotting away inside Christiania only being conserved by the efforts of historians spending their own time and money on it, because the government refuses to
Even wartime execution powers can be used by a government acting in bad faith to execute dissidents
Opposition to the death penalty should, in my opinion, be absolute, but you have the right to disagree of course
Luckily, Denmark abolished wartime death penalty in 1978
Well most Danes despised the Germans by then because of what they did during the first world war for taking Danish soldiers to fight for them from Slesvig, even though Denmark was neutral during WW1
it's important to note that the war in Denmark, wasn't anything near what it was in Poland
Denmark surrendered after a couple of hours of fighting, and a cooperation government was formed that actively urged the Danes to cooperate with the German occupation soldiers
Also all of this were actually controlled by the danish resistance movement and not state officials, and there are quite a few stories of members getting their revenge on old foes by claiming they were collaborators
It was first in 1993 that it was completly abolished

Well, bokmål is probably the closest we get
As I had understood it, Norway has two languages, Bokmål and Nynorsk, both spoken and written
And I had somehow always thought differently, but TIL
Perhaps the loss of Norway and Schleswig and Holstein
After this Denmark for the first time in several hundred years was definitively no longer a player in European politics
Denmark had to redefine itself as it was now small, homogenous, weak and poor so we unified around everything Danish like the language, vikings, nature in art and literature
I would say it is the loss In the Second Schleswig war, loosing a lot of the best land to Prussiaz
That really changed alot about the identity
I agree, and I would say that the second Slesvig war and specifically the (lost) battle at Dybøl is the quintessential moment of that process
Another example could be when King Harald Bluetooth unified the Danish kingdom and his baptism in ~965
The introduction of Christianity was a pretty big thing, considering how powerfull the church would become in the following 1000 years
Christmas rice porridge
I just don’t like porridge, period
Every Christmas I get the same “WHAT
You don’t even consume the holy *risengrød*?!?!”
I actually love our cuisine in general, despite being a huge food lover
I worded it like that because there is a tendency to stereotype every European cuisine other than France, Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal as horrendous and bland
I pretty vehemently disagree, although I acknowledge that they have had the advantage of having the climate for a bunch of interesting vegetables
Herring, wether it be smoked pickled or fried, throw that fish back into the sea because its garbage
I hate it, too
Even as a kid, I couldn't stand it
I like porridge, just not rice porridge
And butter and cinnemon just make it even more gross
I like Risengrød, but used to hate Risalamande with a burning passion
Then I started making it myself and now it’s S tier (gotta roast the almonds before chopping them up)
Danes only eat it at Xmas - Icelanders eat it all year  Personally I like a good rice pudding (but having it at Xmas is enough)
U really think I would take advice from a Swede
Solid advice - the other day we ran out of whole fat milk so I made it for my son with full fat cream
World, meet Guldrisengrød.
It’s extremely varying what people do on the 23th
Some families have that tradition but certainly not all
People just eat it throughout December
I’m so interested in trying some Balkan food
What would you recommend
In Danish and I think other Scandinavian languages we have the word “grød”, which covers both oatmeal but also things like rice porridge
Basically, grains boiled with water or milk

Our [war museum] damn we have had a lot of wars
[M/S Maritime Museum of Denmark] build at an old shipyard, really cool location next to [Kronborg Castle] (Hamlet
“[The old city] see how we lived in the 1970s, 1920s and before 1900 in the city
[Frilandsmuseet] buildings from Denmark through the last 350 years
All I really remember about the Nordic museum is that it had several mistakes about Denmark
I visited back in 2018 with a bunch of my fellow history majors and we ended up being so annoyed at all the mistakes that we filled out a costumer review where we asked them to correct all their mistakes
Do you remember some of them
I remember one that annoyed me was that they claimed we didn't celebrate Lucia Day in Denmark and that we never did
They also had that weird Christian Den Gode lie that I often hear from Swedes
Yeah, they wrote about how we apparently call him "Christian den gode", which we never did  it's a lie fabricated by Swedish historians in the mid 1900s, it's assumed to have been as part of some anti-Denmark sentiment, and for some reason a lot of Swedes (that I have met both IRL and online) actually have been taught it as true in school
There are very few stores in Denmark so i say not very prevalent i counted 10 stores on google maps
On the other hand the one closest to me has been there all my life so guess they do alright
There are only 11, McDonald’s is probably more preferred here
They have plans to open another 25 restaurants
Yes
Dining out is expensive and not something most people can afford on a regular (multiple times a week) basis
We don’t have a restaurant culture like in Southern Europe
The vast majority of people’s meals will need to be cooked by themselves
Cooking is also curriculum in Denmark, I’ve said this on the sub before and France, Spain and Italy freaked out
It was really funny, I feel like those countries would have cooking a part of education if anyone

A 3000-year bromance
Not sure if the feeling is mutual for them
You mentioned Denmark, and positively even, but not Finland or Norway
Are you sure you're Swedish
Bikes, Super flat country, Tall and blonde, Chocolate on bread, Windmills, Vaguely potato sounding accent when talking English
Yup, pretty similar I'd say
Weird language as well
> Chocolate on bread
I don't know about that
They use those silly colored sprinkles
It's not a proper piece of chocolate
Ah, you're right
I didn't read the question correctly
Still flattered that a Swede said something positive about us lol
I'm sure we're more hilly overall, but our tallest point is 171m, while yours is a staggering 322
4 meters at Vaalserberg
(I was surprised to learn about that)
Dont worry, I think most Danes and Norwegians definitely think of you that way as well
I think Sweden is way closer to Finland in a way we're not
First I got a painter, and was a tad confused
Then I added "Chocolate" and got a product I've seen before
Sprinkles
Huh, thought "Með löggum skal land byggja" sounded familiar
The courthouse in Copenhagen has "Med lov skal man land bygge" on its' Pediment
I wish
The closest we get are the cliffs at Møn. But they aren't even tall compared to most other places in the world
we literally have a far left party who gets almost all their parliament seats from our capitol region since its our largest urban area, I vote for them too but it matters little in my remote rural area where almost nobody votes for them
Some may have a different view but i feel like Copenhagen is a world of its own particularly in the summer when there are tourists
It just feels different in every way
well also them yes, but there are 2 more socialist parties
This is just my interpretation, ok
but here goes; Ventre, centre-right party has had a firm hold on the small-to-medium rural farmers and some industries while the centre-left social democrats are more broadly represented among various regional industries workers, though more concentrated in cities too, though its not uniform across the country and the economic vs social-policies political blocs are more fractured than ever
What with the social democrats not repealing the right-wings tightened asylum and refugee policies
But the hard-left socialists are much more concentrated purely in the capital
our "red bloc" is rather large [List\_of\_political\_parties\_in\_Denmark]
A quick look at election statistics show that the three most left parties got double as many votes from the greater Copenhagen area in 1977 and still does in 2019
I think the Swedish left party as well as your social democrats have had a much bigger base and involvement from the rural areas from the start, whereas the Danish left wing parties have been more dominated by students, academics and workers from the few big industries that were centralised in the biggest cities
Occasionally schools, nursery homes or just families will have one
A “gift game”, I.e if you roll a six you can take a gift from a massive pile of gifts is more common though
Often the gifts are intentionally useless
We have an advent calendar scratch card
You get a certain number of Santa’s or Christmas trees and you win a cash prize
We have a Christmas scratch card calendar(each day and sunday advent you scratch a square), where you can win 1 million crowns as the big prize and several smaller prizes
**Norway**
Going to [The Gathering] in Hamar with a bunch of friends in (I think) 1997
Happy nerds everywhere, lots of coding and swapping tips and tricks with fellow geeks
**Sweden**
Spending three weeks canoeing with my son
Taking our time to get nowhere, and setting up camp whenever we wanted
No cell service, no obligations, and practically no people
**Finland**
Making friends with a Finnish border guard after crossing into Finland from Russia
My coworker and I had spent a few weeks in then-soviet Russia, and was happy to get back to "Western Quality" of
well, everything
The guard was going off duty, and joined us the local eatery of the small town on the border (I forgot the name)
**Russia**
Being invited home to dinner with a translator I had worked extensively with over some years, in the mid 90s. His family and I spent the better part of the evening and night eating dinner, drinking tea, and discussing the future of Russia
Later his daughter would end up living here in Denmark, and we still stay in contact
**Poland**
A coworker and I tried to drive through the night to get from somewhere I can't remember to our hotel in Germany
We wound up getting too tired and slept in the car
The following morning we were hungry and bleary eyed, and spotted what looked like an inn, so we went inside to get something to eat
A lot of the locals were hanging around, sipping coffee and idly chatting, and the innkeeper offered us coffee, and asked
something in Polish
We couldn't understand her, and neither she, nor any of the locals could speak anything but Polish
She got the meaning that we were hungry, so she grabbed us by the hands and took us into the kitchen where she opened larders, cupboards, and fridges and expected us to point at what we wanted
In the end we wound up with an awesome breakfast with eggs, bread, butter, milk, and something that looked and tasted kinda like knödlen
I can't remember how much we paid for it, but everyone's friendly curiosity was just so heartwarning
**Germany**
Living and working a few weeks in Lindau im Bodensee, the old part of town on the island in the lake
I could see myself living there
**England**
I once set off an explosives detector when I flew into Heathrow airport because I had been on a military explosives course shortly before I had to go to London for work
Practically everything I carried were apparently showing traces of explosives, and I had an actually rather pleasant chat, and a cup of tea, with the security staff while they looked through my luggage and verified my story with (I guess) the Danish Ministry of Defense
All in all that's a story in itself, but what really made it stand out was the fact that the same person who had initially tested my luggage when flying into London was the same person who tested it when flying out again some days later
He had a good guffaw when he noticed me, and while I still had my luggage thoroughly searched, he took the time to calm the obvious nerves of what looked to be his apprentice, and make idle chatter with me
**Belgium**
I drove through the country once
The motorway was in good condition, and all of it was lighted through the night
It was quite a while ago, though
**The Netherlands**
Spent a week training on a specific type of [Digital] software, with participants from all over the world
The course itself was so-so, but our odd group of students from every corner of the globe formed a friendship that would last several decades
That was also my first introduction to "true" Indian cooking, as well as the insane complexity of the Israeli/Palestinian problem
**Spain**
My wife getting me to skip the hotel breakfast, and go to the market just off the Rambla in Barcelona to buy cheese, cold cuts, and bread, and then having breakfast in a quiet corner of Park Güell
**Yugoslavia  (circa 1984)**
Hiring a boat with my girlfriend, and spending the day fishing for mackerel and frying them over a small fire on the beach of some small island
Then slowly sailing home late at night with a sky full of stars and a bright moon to illuminate the way, and my girlfriend snuggling up to me
We split up later that year, but the feeling of tranquility and calm as we made our way back to harbor on a wave-less sea will forever stand out in my mind
Those few hours I realized I was feeling truly happy, and I'll cherish that memory until I die
**Czechoslovakia**
Visiting with my girlfriend in '92ish and finding a little jazz club, partly hidden in the basement of an apartment building, with the entrance through the yard, and down a set of concrete stairs
The stage was only just large enough for an upright piano, a bass/tenor sax player, and a singer
The beer was good, and the atmosphere was awesome, and the bartender greeted us by name after a few visits
Sweden: getting our dog
Britian: eating at the street food markets by the river
France: going up in the eiffel tower overlooking paris
switzerland: taking the cabel track to mont blanc
Russia: experiencing St
Petersburg
Spain: nice and long vacation by the beach
Turkey: The mosques in Istanbul
Greece: going up to the acropolis
Italy: driving around Sardinia
In Denmark; we have had some infamous people from the different biker gangs like Hells Angels and Bandidos
They weren't necessarily famous from the drug trade itself as much as for the violence and shooting, which is very rare in our country
Our most infamous gangs related to drug trade are all imported, like biker gangs literally just local versions the American ones
Drug trafficking is mainly run by biker gangs like Hells Angels and "immigrant" gangs but there is and i believe has never been a drug kingpin the size and scale of anything seen in north or south america where they essentially run entire neighborhoods and areas, pay off police, run international supply chains, bribe politicians, own lavish mansions and apartments, drive around in fancy cars with convoys of armed men and own expensive jewellery
I once had an easter lunch next some very senior Hells Angels, we got there as they were finishing up lunch and then they har like 3 or 4 bottles of snaps brought out
They drank all of them collapsed like dominoes once or twice and were outta there a bit before we were done
10/10 great entertainment
In Denmark Middle Eastern gangs have also become a problem and are pretty much often in war with bikers over territory
So I wonder if in Sweden just like in Denmark, the bikers are seen as “heroes” by white supremacist and so on
I would say the big guys operate internationally (in Europe), which makes things more complicated
Most big cases there have been in the news, have been when police have discovered trucks or containers coming into the country
Also pretty much, depending on where in Denmark, I would either go to a biker related local white guy, a Middle Eastern, or a Eastern European for drugs
So it’s my overall understanding it’s all small fries here
Very unlikely but probably Sønderjylland which was part of Germany until 1920
[Fyn] (Funen in English)
I'm halfway joking, but there was a political party they was called "Befri Fyn" (Liberate Fyn) and most of their agenda was to have Fyn sceded and then tax everyone wanted to use things from Fyn
Like a tax or fee for each time an HC Andersen story was sold
Or a tax when someone eats a specific cake from Fyn
Something along those lines
I guess Greenland doesn't count considering it's not really considered a part of our country, but more so a part of our kingdom
So I would probably say something like Jutland if I have to be honest, but it seems rather extreme
Isn't there a large Russian minority on Svalbard
They could do a Crimea on you
Or Greenland and the Faroe Islands if we count them
Maybe Bornholm becomes independent
Sønderjylland is the most nationalist part of the country
Do you remember the election in 2015
Is Taffel Finnish
Oh my God
I had no clue
It is one of the few brands I have stayed loyal to since childhood
You have ruined it
I don't think we would even take it back anymore
Never seen a stray dog in my life here
All dogs are registered and chipped here
government agency you can call will "take care of them" for free
We like being honest with our kids about the meat going into their mouths, its pretty common for young school kids to visit a farm, its also very common for the Zoo's to do that, but us Danes turn it into an educational time for kids about the african plain animals food chain etc
the official reply from the zoo was "taking advice from the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria, it did this to prevent inbreeding as the zoo's giraffe breeding program already has enough animals with similar genes "
Blue for the most part
Although also a decent amount of black
Probably 65/35 blue/black
I’ve heard in Germany kids still have to learn to write with fountain pens
Heard from a left-handed German that she got such bad handwriting grades because of this lol
I can see that but being left-handed, I think I would find that so frustrating
He is technically correct, which is the best kind of correct
I would have thought a German would appreciate that :P
Not really, we do have dialects in Denmark, but we just focus on risdansk, or pure danish
I lived in the Southern part of Jylland my whole childhood, but we were never taught in school how to speak the dialect there, so I never learned it
I can understand some of it though
I find dialects charming
Now I live in the western part of Jylland
And here we also have a bit of a dialect
I can teach you something rather simple I learned here in the west
Here they have a word which is spelled: Hov
(said more like Huw) If you have an accident, this word is more than enough to say: Sorry, my bad, everything wrong, apologies
But all you say is just "Hov
" And it's just like a sound
Took me a while to understand that is enough to just say that here
Denmark
We were taught the differences between the different dialects and accents in a superficial non-technical way
Some very old teachers native to these areas would read aloud from a text in Sønderjysk and Bornholmsk
Unfortunately many are dialects are dying out as the young people tend to converge and sound like they do in capital region
I did have a brief focus on the dialects of Denmark during folkeskole in Danish class
I remember we watched these videos of people reading the same story but in different dialects - like Copenhagens, Thybomål, Alsisk, and Sønderjydsk
But, tbh, it was very brief and we never covered anything like that again
&#x200B;
Also, risdansk gave me a little laugh ;)
But i did have a course in school were we were taught a bit about swedish, icelandic and norwegian
I remember having to read and excerpt of some icelandic saga in original language
Absolutely impossible
It isn't risdansk  that's why it made me laugh a little
Its rigsdansk, which basically means "Kingdom danish"
Ohh
Hahaa that honestly makes more sense
I got no idea why I've always thought it was risdansk
Suppose I had too much Risengrød.
It's like when Pyrus applied to Rigsarkivet, thinking it was a place filled with rice
I miss Pyrus
Such good memories
Me too :( best julekalender we ever had tbh
I still have it on VHS
ham and cheese
salad and vegies preferd but not required
put mayo on it and il
be prety upset
A good flæskestegs sandwich is personally my favourite
That's not proper rye bread
Proper rye bread looks like [this]
I'd argue that our rye bread is simply more sophisticated (and therefore better), than your simple (sorry excuse for) rye bread
One rye bread to rule them all
Blasphemy
There shouldn't be flour on top of the bread
I would actually say our recent election was quite refreshing
How power was handed from the right to the left, where the sitting prime minister insisted on being intirim prime minister, not political
That was so refreshing
Smaller countries tend to be more dependent on other countries and thus better at English which is necessary for me
German is my “3rd” language and not much more;)
So I imagine that Austrians and Swiz ppl are better at English
However, I think Switzerland is quite expensive on many parameters
So Austria it is
Second would probably be Bayern/Baden-W. Germany got cheap cars;) (relative to my flair)
And I love the shape of nature north of the Alps
Slesvig wouldn’t do it for me
I actually don't know
Is it cheating if I say "Germany, but only the parts right next to Denmark"?
Germany, southern Slesvig
Basically nothing would change, depending on the social circles I associated with I could even keep speaking Danish
i'd pick switzerland, but i really dont know why
Switzerland is like the north korea of europe
The high salaries ain’t there for fun
Switzerland ain’t cheap, or am I wrong
i guess i just know almost nothing about the place
and they're rarely, if ever, mentioned in the news where i live
I just checked and prices vary depending on when you wish to travel
But an weekday trip price between the two biggest cities in Denmark with a stop in the third biggest is 30€. The trip takes 2h and 50m.
Quick calculation says its cheaper than car if you are one person, about the same if you're 2 and more expensive if you are three
On weekends the tickets are more pricy and here the breakeven looks to be between 1 and 2 travellers
In some cases I think it's actually more common that locating it in the capital
Don't take my word for it tho
Until recently not coming
Lately our previous government decided to move lots of the essential institutions outside the capital
This is having catastrophic consequences as these areas lack qualified labour and the current experienced employees won't move to the middle of nowhere
It is getting more Common
The last goverment adopted a policy of moving out central administration away from Copenhagen
historically very uncommon, but the government made a move a couple of years back to move a couple of institutions away from copenhagen
Among the most notable was The Danish Language Council (Dansk Sprognævn) and the Environmental Protection Agency (miljøstyrelsen)
Yes, but it was part of a populistic comprimise with the right wing party
Hence, the only argument for doing this was to get more votes from the less populated areas
This populistic compromise is now having significant consequenses
While I do get the reason to do it, my personal opinion is that such drastic measures should have a more solid argument and reason behind it than hunting populistic votes
E.g. lowering unemployment rates in these areas, more qualified employees or even cost saving
This has resulted in neither of these things
"Brev til månen" (Letter to the moon) by Ib Michael was the book that I had the most trouble getting through
It's about a young man in the sixties, who spends most of the book being in love with his best friend's sort of girlfriend
It's written in a very boring and slow way and most of the main characters are not great people
The only part of it that I enjoyed even a little was at the very end where the main character almost dies in a plain crash, but even that is somehow wirtten in a way that takes away all the intensity of the situation
That or Faroese
Knowing absolutely nothing about Swiss gun laws, I'm pretty sure they're infinitely more strict than (the average) American gun laws, so the comparison wouldn't be worth the paper it's written on
Aren't there also strict rules for how you can store weapons
I seem to remember hearing that you must have a safe for weapon storage, which the police can inspect at will to ensure that it's stored correctly
*Wealth* inequality is actually pretty high in Denmark (compared to the rest of Europe), while *income* inequality is the lowest or one of the lowest
Wealth inequality is hard to measure and research
But I think the theory is that very few Danes, compared to other countries, see the need for holding stocks, bonds and savings because welfare
So it runs in very few upper-class families where you inherit and are taught that’s it’s a good thing to have, while the general population just don’t care that much
Denmark
I am quite happy with my disposable income
I am not where real estate is affordable yet, at least not in my city, but i do have plenty for savings and investments
Can relate
Got a good (free) education, good job and more than sufficient income
Never seen a need for investing besides safe investments (as in real estate and bonds) for that very reason
Which is very sad and needs to change
400 DKK is 65 dollars, soooo I think they earn well above that haha
From google: “someone newly educated with a bachelor in software development can except to earn 30
000-35
000 DKK (4872-5684 dollars) a month
You will have the opportunity to become a developmental leader later, earning maybe 50
000 DKK (8120-8932 dollars) a month”.
... before taxes
I’m not quite on the real adult job market yet so I might not be the best to ask
But income tax is close to 50% if you earn more than 544
000 a year, which you do at 43
000 ish a month
Before that threshold it’s still quite high
At 30
000 DKK a month you’ll get about 20
000 (3248 dollars) in your pocket
At 50
000 DKK you’ll get 30
000 in pocket
A school teacher earns about 30
000 DKK a month for reference (again, before taxes)
Eternally growing wealth is happening everywhere, all the time
As long as humans are born and as long as those humans use money, or just want things, it will continue
Saying it is unrealistic is the same as disputing the laws of physics, it's just how things work
There are no negative outcomes when properly investing and it is a great way to raise one's wealth even further, on top of that it is idiotically simple to do and more people really should get into it
It has been growing for over 200 years, some wealthy families have grown for even longer than that
But do you really expect that humanity will just stop
It won't, ever
Not using ad much doesn't mean it will go negative
Only when the solar system is completely depleted, which will take a long time
There are 0 reasons to not invest
As long ad you have any money available for use, there is no reason not to
Yes, but a lot of money doesn't come from nowhere
It is all about those small beginnings, those tiny increments that can set it off
If you give up on investing because "well I won't be a millionaire tomorrow, so what's the point", you won't move one bit economically
And when those small stock investments have payed of you can start dreaming a little bigger, maybe invest in something that isn't stocks, maybe just some bigger stocks
"Nothing comes easy" is wrong, because investing is very easy, "nothing comes fast" is the actual truth
Time in the market matters more than timing
Even if you want to invest in stocks but are scared about individual stocks, you can just throw your money at an index fund at watch it grow over a couple of decades
i just make up new words when that happens, noone notices
I've had this exact same thing happen
Something weirder, is when a word suddenly 'loses meaning', where I cognitively am aware what it means but the word is just this random sounds and lettering
Like a strange disconnect
Happens all the time
I'm not embarrassed in the slightest though, I'm fine with it
I'm a student, it happens to everyone around me as well
I've used English to an extent where it seems natural to get stuck in one of the codes once in a while
To be fair, I dated an English guy for a couple of years and had very close friends in college that were international, so I've used English a lot
Because my closest friends were Danish, half Danish/half Italian and half German/half American, we ended up switching back and forth between Danish and English to a degree that it's completely normal for me to switch back and forth in the middle of a sentence
Good times
I'm a big fan of the Faroese variant of Danish, which is known as Gøtudanskt
I feel like it is the perfect compromise between Danish and Norwegian, and I'm fairly convinced it's the most commonly intelligible language between Danish, Norwegian and Swedish
At least for Danes and Norwegians, some Swedish people will have to weigh in on it, if they understand it better than they understand Norwegian
[I'm just gonna leave this here
&#x200B;
^(take that Sweden
Fuck
Norweigan is like danish but alot more charming
For me it´s Danish, even before I moved here
It just rubs me the right way when I hear it and always made me feel wholesome
It´s just really hard to learn :(
i must say that danish is the most beautiful language in existence
Danish
ITT people being categorically wrong
We have that too, you know :(
Bicycle Buddies Friendship Club = abolished
Yes
I love you
\*edderkop
> Though I have to say that in this interview of Eivør Pálsdóttir she does sound quite interesting
And at least she is understandable :P
But that's because she doesn't speak Norwegian at all, she speaks Gøtudanskt, which is how Danish traditionally was spoken on the Faroes, and which incidentally is named after her hometown Gøta
She does spice it up by saying mye instead of meget, but that might be how it's usually done in Gøtu, as it flows a good bit better than pronouncing meget with a hard g.
Imo Gøtudanskt is without any doubt the most easily understandable Scandinavian language
Yes
But we don't sound that good to others with that dumb potato in our mouth
What's up with the extra k in tak
Oh boy, you are going to get shanked like a grind, if you are implying Gøtudanskt is Faroese
I think the Faroese might you beat you up if you said that to them
I live an area of Copenhagen with more Faroese than Danes and I can honestly say they beat Sweden in how little they like Denmark ;)
Finland Swedish is also pretty easy for me
But Gøtu should be fairly straight forward for Icelanders, it's basically how Danish is taught and spoken in Iceland
... what
Danish has more phonemes than Norwegian, by a fair bit
Hell, I think Danish is the language with the most vowel sounds in the world
You mean letters
I’m pretty sure they have one more than us
Pronounciation
Certainly, a lot of our vocals are pronounced exactly the same
Socialdemokrat
Kælling
Hængerøv
Svenskerhår.
Interplanetære fribytter
Faroese was considered a Danish dialect up until the middle of the 19th century
isn't it that small minority swedish they found in a valley somewhere, that's actually closest
Only choked by you Norway <3
[Relevant webcomic]
At least a contender, I think we have about 30 different or so, and hell even with a lot of the vowel collapse that's going on, we are still going to be up there in the top
Roofs as in *tage*?
How do you say two k's after each other
Don't you swallow the last k?
Personally I think Norwegians say tak and only spell it takk
No I mean grind as in pilot whales
That's actually true
The pitch in Danish depend on the diealect
In a (strong) Copenhagen dialect you'd end up as well
It means [mullet
What if we formed a union at Kalmar
...Unless
Oh good it was a silly fight anyway
But now that our love is reunited, remind me again what his charm was in the first place
Denmark is smaller, but the older country - so geographically I'd say Norway is our daddy, while historically we are theirs
Yes, it's a male name and also a roof
I will thank my roof next time it rains
Tak tag
Takk tak
Thank you for the explanation
Mange tak(k)
I can't find any Danish words that end with a double consonant, so I can't really compare it
If you would thank your roof, would you say:
Takk tak
That actually makes sense, even in Danish where double consonant is also indication of short vowel sound
Vikings are back in town, pick up the bone  we finna be in Vineland in a minute
DR 1, which is the main tv-channel of the public-service Danish Broadcasting Corporation
The "DR" stands for "Danmarks Radio", since the company was orginally created as a public radio broadcasting company
Far from "really annoying" me, this is actually an incredibly tiny thing, but I hear it so persistently that it has started grating on me
For some godforsaken reason, Danes *insist* on trying to pronounce English place-names and brands in the English way, instead of just pronouncing it like a Dane would
Imagine an English news-anchor insisting on pronouncing every French or Hungarian city in the native fashion - it would be really jarring
This is not helped by most Danes having subpar English pronunciation
This is also only the case for English-speaking countries
If we're talking about Greece or India, we're going to pronounce it like a Dane normally would
Since many cities in e.g. America are named after places in Europe, this means that a Danish journalist might pronounce Athens (Greece) differently from Athens (America)
> we say "sister's son" or "brother's daughter" and so on
I mean, if those are a compound word, then that *is* your word for nephews and nieces
That's the way it is in many languages
In Danish, although we have *nevø* and *niece*, *søstersøn*/*brordatter*/etc
is the older way of saying it
Same in English
Denmark is now the 17th Bundesländer and I am guessing we're pretty pissed about it
no no no, we're the dominant ones
germany will become southern denmark and we'll gently overtake all their industry and money
either way, slesvig-holsten returns to their rightful country
I think Scandinavia (or even the Nordic countries) is perhaps the only European region with a real shot of political unification
But it does lead to some fun discussions of which monarch should remain head of state
Agreed, I like and can understand Norwegian (Bokmål) far better than Swedish
Not to mention reading Norwegian is easy as fuck for us Danes
&#x200B;
Now give us oil monies to fix our crumbling public infrastructure høhø
Are we more liberal than you guys
Is Bundesland the singular
It's been a few yeqrs since I last had a German class
> germany will become southern denmark
Oh great
Border runs for beer will be a *fucking long drive* now
>:(
If the rule is closest Capital to yours I would say Denmark would be the one
we will just do like in malaysia with a rotating monarchy
I think a lot of people in Copenhagen has a decent grasp of Swedish since Malmö and Cph are super interconnected
I see so many Swedes here and they are always a cheery bunch and great drinking companions so I certainly wouldn't mind more integration between Scandinavia
Suggest we start speaking Norwegian
It's a fair compromise between pronunciation and spelling of the three countries
Or we go back to old Norse
Perhaps liberal as in the scandinavian version of it, as in rightwinged
I think the -er adds pluralis to a scentence, doesn't it
you will then become part of our new glorious north sea empire as well
we didn't have lego back then
and even so, let's just say we've got our means and leave it at that ;)))
Most definitely
No because all of those are private enterprises netting very little benefit to the general public and our coalition government is actively neglecting our welfare services, if they aren't further slashing its budget that is ;(
icelandic, anyone
Thats propably true
Forget about our version of liberal when im on reddit (American influende i suppose)
Thats also possible, because if it is liberal in economical sense (scandinavian one) then Denmark is, by far, the least liberal country in Scandinavia
Pretty sure we have the highest taxes
Honestly I never really thought of that
Thought you guys were sexual alcoholic demons like us
plus the umlaut over the a
Damn
355 km from Copenhagen and 350 from Prague
sure
> Can there be more vowels than in Danish speech
I think we are the ones with the most in the world, we have like 32 different or so
> But as soon as they open their mouths you just hear a single initial consonant, followed by a long string of slurred diphthongs
We prefer to be called "Modern Day Windtalkers", thanks
Thanks for the cool bonus trivia
Hell yeah
yes
When I was a little kid I thought Denmark and England were the only countries in the world
My though was similar
I thought every country used euros except for Denmark
But why
A lunchbox does the job just fine
We will never succumb to imperialist currency
I have no idea
They were apparently the only countries I knew back then
Usually in larger gatherings but for smaller parties kids usually sit with their parents

The name of our supreme court is "Højesteret" literally meaning "the highest court".
There are currently 18 judges
99% of all Danes cannot name a single judge because they're rarely discussed
They aren't nominated by politicians but rather by an independent council based on their merits
They also retire by default when they turn 70
We say ones before tens as well
Danish numbers are notorious for sounding strange as they shift from a 10 base to a 20 base similar to French numbers
20 - tyve
30 - tredve
40 - fyrre or fyrretyve
It's four tens but the litteral translation is four twenties
Here comes the strange part:
50 - halvtreds or halvtredsindstyve
It's half third times twenty (3-½ \* 20)
60 - tres or tresindstyve
Three times twenty (3\*20)
70 - halvfjerds or halvfjerdsindstyve
Half fourth times twenty (4-½ \* 20)
80 - firs or firsindstyve
Four times twenty (4\*20)
90 - halvfems or halvfemsindstyve
Half fifth times twenty (5-½ \* 20)
You're messing up cardinal and ordinal numbers
"Halvfjerdsindstyvende" means 70th whereas just "halvfjerdsindstyve" means 70
The Swedish number system is so simple
I envy you guys T_T
I'm surprised he told everyone about our secret  numbering system
Now how are we going to reweal the Swedish spies
Oh well, they will probably mess it up under pressure
I'll change it
We used to have Swedish/Norwegian/English system as well, but apparently switched as it was easier for herring merchants
No joke
I wish, that could help with our subpar math education
118 = one hundred and eight ten = et hundrede atten
177 = one hundred and seven seventy = et hundrede syv og halvfjerdsindstyve
We have **multiple variations** of counting in our thousands
2500 = two thousand five hundred = to tusinde fem hundrede
2500 = two one half thousand = to et halvt tusinde
2500 = five and twenty hundreds = fem og tyve hundrede
Because we say *on* Iceland in Danish
:-)
We just have to make the system even more complex
[An entire hippie village] with classic hippie stuff like no cars, no advertisements, wacky architecture, animals running around, concerts and the biggest and most openly displayed weed market in Denmark
They sit on what would now be prime real estate in Copenhagen but no houses there are “for sale” like regular housing
One of my favorite places ever
The drug trade got taken over by organized gangs because duh
But everything else about the place is just wonderful

[Aqua
Lucas Graham
Idk, he's not *that* popular, bug he's up there
Lukas Graham, Mø and Aqua
Just to add a few:
MØ is pretty popular recently: [Final Song] and [Lean On]
Lukas Graham, presumably most known for [7 Years]
Volbeat has definitely had some international succes as well: [For evigt]
While I guess the likelihood of an American having ever heard of them is low, Dúné definitely toured a bunch in Europe and Japan: [80 Years]
And then I've always found it kinda funny that Dizzy Mizz Lizzy was relatively popular in Japan as well
Just seems weird: [Silverflame]
Kraftwerk
Don't forget Metallica founded by Lars Ulrich
Safri Duo
I heard that Mew ([Link] had some success internationally as well
Especially in Asia

Go' Mor'n Go' Mor'n by Annisette
Wow
Gomorn is exactly what we say
Only talk to driver if you’re buying a ticket
Otherwise we generally dont interact
Never talk to anyone
Seriously
That's dangerous
Run before it's too late
Lol that reminds me of something that happened on one of the few public bus rides I’ve taken
So basically some woman gets on a few stops after I got on and she said hi to everyone sitting in the vicinity and tried to converse with another passenger
I got instantly annoyed at her greeting me and when she started trying to converse I assumed she was mentally unwell
I felt bad for the other passenger who you could hear the annoyance in her tone when she gave short and close-ended answers back
I’ve had a bus driver in the countryside in Sønderjylland get angry that I didn’t say hi
I always thanked the driver for the trip when I lived in Århus
Would not dare to do that in Copenhagen for sure
I recently spoke with a girl from Portugal about this
She said she would even tell "bye" when she exited the bus from the back
Honestly I find that more rude than polite
Yelling in public, disturbing everybody on the bus and outiside for some arbitrary reason
Seemed odd to me
Yet she found me very rude for saying I never said hello or goodbye, so different strokes
I know this is a joke but I think this stereotype is really overblown personally, I’m in Copenhagen and I probably do a bit of banter with a cashier, a little remark in a queue etc a handful of times a year
On weekend nights it’s full-fledged conversations and mixing of friend groups
I don’t know if my friend group is weird or people stop doing it when they’re older (we’re around 18 ish) or what the deal is
Vi saje mojn når vi komme
I mean, you exit in the back or the middle in Copenhagen, so you would have to either walk up and thank them before you exit, or yell it across the bus  even when I didn't live in Copenhagen I would have found that excessive
"du skal ikke råbe i min bus
er du fuld
" or dead silence is what imagine the response would be :D
If i make smalltalk with the bus driver i would probably get some really weird looks
My cousin still tells the story about a "crazy American" who sat down with him and his friends at a picnic table and started talking to them, trying to make friends since "he didn't know anybody in town and had recently moved here". But that is mostly because they kept trying to cuing him into the fact that they wanted him to leave, but he didn't.
I think a lot is excused due to people being aware that people are more friendly in the US
You just have to be aware of the way people act when you do - if they are clearly not in the mood / don't have time, then drop it (they won't tell you this unless you really crossed the line and missed all their cues, BTW, you have to look at body language or how they answer you), otherwise, you are good
Either that or: "slap lige af mand" and everybody staring in anger
“Damn this queue is moving slowly”, “yeah haha”. It’s mostly not me, but the strangers who initiate this type of back and forth
It doesn’t happen every month, but every other month perhaps
At weekend nights it can be at the supermarket or public transport
In the summer, people who are also hanging out at the park/beach/wherever
Mojn in Southern Jutland Danish is different from German moin
It just means hi/bye
Think of it like the Hawaiian “Aloha”
Movies like "Rejsen til Saturn" and "Terkel i Knibe" were really popular when they came out
Jungledyret Hugo 1 & 2 are pretty nostalgic to me
We don’t talk about the third one though
A classic danish animated film would be [Valhalla] from [1986] which is based on a popular [comic series] about the nordic gods
Another very popular animated "film" is a short documentary called [The Tale of the Wonderful Potato] (1985)
Which is about the history of the potato, so it's often shown to younger school students
Hjælp Jeg Er En Fisk is also a really good one
Now we also have "Den ternede Ninja" from the same guy who did "Terkel i Knibe" and it's also really good, though not as violent
Other Danish animated movies which haven't already been mentioned:
Valhalla
Animated movie based on a comic series about Nordic Mythology
Jungledyret Hugo (Jungle Jack)
Very cute and charming movie
Jungledyret Hugo 2 - den store filmhelt (Hugo: The Movie Star - the American version is censored)
Amazing movie, though the American version is censored / edited
~~Jungledyret Hugo 3 - fræk, flabet og fri (Amazon Jack)~~
We don't talk about this movie
Ronal Barbaren (Ronal the Barbarian)
A very funny movie if you can embrace the crass humor
Also, if we are talking more "kid friendly" (though i watched both of those as a preteen), I'd add Valhal to the list
Absolute classic
Or even that show that animated all of H C Andersens fairy tales
"Der var engang" I think it was called :)
*regnen, though tbh the show isn't that popular here in Denmark
Also I think OP was looking for animated shows :)
What do you mean
The Rain is a live action show, it's not animated
Or is there some other show by that name as well
I'm a little yellow fish in the deep blue sea
I think the common complaint is that it's too American :)
My teacher told me he was in a awkward situation when he asked a norwegian friend of his if they should get morgenbrød (morning buns), which apparently mean morning wood in norwegian
Last summer I was on vacation with my Norwegian gf and her family
We had a couple of beers, and when we had to pay I wanted to offer to pay the bill
I asked her “må jeg betale
” which means “may I pay
” in Danish
Her response was not as I expected, she seemed a bit offended and just responded “nej, du MÅ ikke” = “no, you MAY not”.
The misunderstanding was that “må” means “may” in Danish but “have to” in Norwegian
So in her Norwegian ears I asked her “do I have to pay
” and she understandably answered “you don’t HAVE to pay”.
Why are you like this, Finland
Rolig nu :P
Some say that there are no Greek women
And that the Greek just grow out of the ground
Which is obviously ridiculous
I feel like it always goes the same way
People touting that this is the year we repeat EC 1992, and then when it fails, everyone goes: "well, of course
I always knew we never stood a chance
I mean, we did really well at the WC in 2018, but I doubt we will repeat that
Keeping in mind that the EU Championships is even more difficult to advance in, I guess our best bet would be quarterfinals, and that would be alright
>I feel like it always goes the same way
People touting that this is the year we repeat EC 1992
First time I hear of this, that's not at all the common conception, from pundits or fans - people know 92 was a once in a life time fluke
I expect a repeat of the of the 2018 WC where we give every team a fight but ultimately narrowly get kicked out in the knockout phase
Usually my only hope is that we do better than you
You too ️
Swedish is a beautiful language, it's a very melodic language, if you ask me

Arch Enemy is Swedish but sings in English

Here's one for the Norwegians: How do you feel about Christian IV
You cause one little bloodbath and you get named a tyrant
&#x200B;
But seriously, he's one of those kings rarely mentioned, so not many has an opinion on him
nah, not really
Mostly I would say Danes are not taught an opinion about him at all
Well, the only thing i know about him is his involvement in the Stockholm bloodbath
So i of course view him as a nice person /s
Case in point: Valdemar Sejr (lit
"Victory") is remembered as one of the greatest Danish kings, in part because of crusading in Estonia
So I googled it - because I'm taking a masters in history, so I was very confused when I'd never heard about him being called "Christian den gode" and here's what I found (loosely translated) from [Danmarkshistorien
dk] article about how Christian the 2nd was viewed in Sweden and in Denmark:
"An interesting development about this is that in the 1900-century, a myth about him being called "Christian the Good" in Denmark, started spreading throughout Sweden
\[...\] Partly this myth harmonizes with the image Christian himself tried to create after he was dethroned \[...\] the name "the good" is not anything he was ever called".
[source]
Given our history it's surprising how little Swedish history we learn and that we don't really have any  clear-cut Swedish villains everybody knows - guess it's a bit like losing interest in a long series that didn't turn out the way you hoped
Don't know
That's why I'm asking
They should do a remake of Gøngehøvdingen
No worries
Some people are worried, but the Danish language is such a core part of Danish identity, that it will never truly disappear
I mean
No matter what, the danish being spoken now, won't be spoken in 200 years anyways
Languages are constantly evolving
So I think it is futile to try an preserve them
Practically, it would be a lot easier without all of these languages dividing Europe
as a dane im not at all worried, our language is way too old to be replaced, hell, alot of your words came from us
I wonder if sønderjysk will last or be swept away
jeg er 50% sikker på det aldrig har fandtes i forvejen og det bare er en lang praktisk joke
“got it back from the danes” as if it wasn’t part of the homeland of the danes since before the swedish people existed
Most people probably don’t know but we had underclass people called ‘rakkere’. They were rejected from society, spoke their own langauge and made money by emptying toilets and removing carcasses in the night
The sami moose herder
They ride moose, which is pretty cool in my opinion

That was a nice summer

my summerhouse was nice
This narrative, however noble it might seem, is bullshit
The West did not create the Arab Spring
And it was the Arab Spring that lead to the Syrian Civil War and the migrant crisis
If you want to blame the West for something, you can blame it for not intervening more forcefully in Syria, and instead just letting Assad with help from Russia and Iran torture the population into submission
The West could easily have removed Assad if it had intervened like it did in Libya
But instead it has just stuck its head in the sand and let hundreds of thousands die and millions be displaced, because people are “tired of wars”. As if wars are going to go away because you are tired of them
He is Danish in Germany, not Sweden, and says Smørrebrød instead of Börk

of course, i don't want dirt and mud everywhere in my house - especially on my beautiful carpets
Sounds exactly how it’s done in Japan
I don't care if it was expensive
My shoes are comfortable, you better not make me take them off
i clean my floors every other day even though i don't wear shoes inside
so much grime, i must be a magnet to that or something
i still have marks from my mums stilettos from years ago
she seems to think that heels are ok to keep on inside
I honestly have absolutely no idea what tourists eat in Denmark
Our national dish isn't exactly something you'd usually buy off a food truck
Oh, my Dutch roommate makes this from time to time, such a great meal
Fries pork with parsley sauce
(And of course often with potatoes)
But when it was chosen, a couple of years ago
I think the majority of people would have voted for "smørrebrød" (black bread with topping like: pork, ham, sasauge and leverpostej (a kind of pâté))
what poor people eat for lunch, is what we feed tourists
that's pathetic
i'm sorry
Holy shit that's amazing
"normal" ?
Well, yes
but
rabbits are quite pricey compared to other white meats like chicken
i saw a store that sold rabbits for
~25-30 euro if i recall
That's a lot, compared to chicken
and the taste is way too similar IMO, for the price difference to be that big
It is not as normal as chicken, beef and pork
I even think some of my friends might see it as being a bit strange, however I find it delicious
Depends on what you mean by “Not originally from Europe”, because both of my parents are Danish
I was born in Singapore where we lived for a good chunk of years, as my parents were working there
Eventually my parents wanted to go back to Denmark and that’s how i ended up here
Don't think it would cause a huge difference in everyday minutiae if we one day woke up and suddenly were annexed by Sweden or Norway
Norway feels more similar than Sweden
But, I feel like Netherlands are surprisingly close to Denmark
The Dutch are a more sober non-alcoholic and direct version of Danes
I would love to live in Amsterdam
Yeah, that was my experience when visiting NL as well, it's like weirdly similar
Denmark is also very similar to Sweden and Norway for obvious reasons (history) and I obviously didn't expect NL to be *totally* weird and foreign either considering the distances, ethnic groups, geography (seafaring nations) but I certainly didn't expect it to basically feel like home before I went there
There are slight differences here and there in things like building styles and stuff and then there's obviously a language difference, but otherwise it basically felt like being back in Denmark which really surprised me
I didn't really know that much about Dutch culture and people before going there, to me it was just another country in Europe like I see most of them
It seems to be a fairly well functioning country since we rarely hear stories about it etc
but I really had no clue what to expect other than "other European country".
I think it's that even little things feel so familiar that makes it stand out
Most buildings, most streets, most people etc
look just like they do in Denmark
Even simple signs and stuff can be understood if you've got a bit of "talent" when it comes to foreign languages
It's really just about reading the Dutch sign and trying to guess how a word is pronounced and it'll likely remind you of either a Danish word or possibly a German or English word with the same meaning
For example, on the Dutch Wiki article about "Denemarken" it says: "Denemarken is het zuidelijkste Scandinavische land
" and while the "Zuidelijkste" can look a bit complicated to a Dane, if you try to "sound it out" it makes perfect sense
In Danish it's "Sydligste". Any Dane should be able to figure out what "Denemarken is het zuidelijkste Scandinavische land
" means without knowing a word of Dutch honestly
"Danmark er det sydligste skandinaviske land
In someway I feel like Denmark is closer to the Netherlands than Sweden for instance
I also feel like you guys remind me of the UK in terms of housing
Which humour
Denmark is not as progressive as you guys are
I would love to migrate to Amsterdam one day
My cousin from NL said that people in NL finds Danish to be an ugly dutch version of Scandinavian
> it's just that pan Scandinavism never got the same traction in 19th century like pan germanism and pan italianism did
Well, that is sorta pan-germanisms fault
Pan-scandinavism petered out after the loss in the Second Schleswig War
I'd like to see the source of that, because I see the Scandinavian countries like a bunch of brothers
Constantly ragging on each other, but when push comes to shove they'll stand together
But more similar than most countries' own population
>Denmark is building a bridge/tunnel to Germany as counterbalance though
We still have 12 years to create the KALMARUNION
Det må i gerne beholde oppe hos jer
Our “bridge” connecting the east part of Denmark to Germany will be done by then
No and no
not interested in any way
i havn't even watched the classic disney cartoon
(i have read it as a book)
Yeah, I heard about it when it was announced and added it to my IMDB list because of del Toro involvement, but I kinda forgot about it since it was so long ago
But I really like the story of Pinocchio, so I'm happy to see that it's finally starting to move along
Expensive
How dare you
...You're not wrong, though
I agree, at least for Denmark
Very comfortable place to live but not very exciting at all
My favorite activity is traveling abroad
It's actually true, here in the summer times me and my friends have already spent countless of evenings and days together, both male and female friends
In the winter it is often just me and my buds hanging out in the weekends or when we are working out together

we dont have any dialects, except on bornholm, where they speak a mutant swedish danish combo which just sounds funny
to my knowledge thats the only diallect, everyone just speak “rigsdansk” or they atleast try to(sjællandere og jyllændere)
I’m not Scottish obviously, but I cannot stress how important it is to keep both Gaelic and Scots alive
Especially Gaelic given its a Celtic language and there aren’t many Celtic languages alive to begin with
I have a question for you
Just how important are these languages for the Scottish culture and identity
And what is the general consensus in Scotland - do people seem to bother
Absolutely spot on in the sense that it’s often purely political and cultural when it comes to clarifying which languages that classify as independent languages and which ones that could be merely considered as a variation/dialect
However, I’ll try anyways, haha
The alemannisch variations spoken in Switzerland would, imo at least, fit better into the description of being a dialect
Simply because there is a fully fledged dialect continuum within the upper German languages/variations/dialects that connects all the variations
This is completely my own interpretation, but do you see where I’m coming from
I read the first part and was about to call you really old
Turkish guys who own pizzerias and sell Kebabs
How much kebab do you think a country could possibly eat
Now add 30%
Well to be honest the food is pretty good
At least at the places that I have been to
I think which things you reference, depends on what type you are
I grew up where Senecas was often quoted
For example: "Ikke for skolen, men for livet" ("Not for school, but for life")
Other things are more universal, though media is referenced more than books
I'd say there's not much Danish literature that's openly quoted or used by people in everyday life
I'd say H C Andersen is probably most common
Examples like: "what fatter gør er altid det rigtige" ("what dad does is always right" though now said more as a joke), "en fjer bliver til fem høns" ("one feather becomes five hens") and "at rejse er at leve" ("to travel is to live"), comes to mind
One I know as well as been used by politicians, remediated into songs, used at funerals and different parts of it might ring recognisition with most Danes, would be Inger Christensen "Det" (It), which goes (freely translated) like this:
"Et samfund kan være så stenet
At alt er en eneste blok
Og indbyggermassen så benet
At livet er gået i chok
Og hjertet er helt i skygge
Og hjertet er næsten hørt op
Til nogen begynder at bygge
En by der er blød som en krop "
It's hard to translate, because it relies very much on wordplay and doublemeaning, but it's basically:
"A society can be (so/as) stoned
That everything is one block
And the mass of citizens so boned
That life is going into chock
And the heart is all in shadows
And the heart has nearly stopped
Until someone start to build
A city as soft as a body"
I'm looking forward to seeing our teams compete
Eurovision is always in May, which is before the tournament
scenes when 2nd place is Ireland
I mean, Denmark has built up quite a rivalry with Ireland ever since we (the Danes) drew them in the World Cup Qualifying Playoffs in 2017
Plus, there's always been the rivalry/brotherhood with those damn Swedes
What do you think will happen to the group if Russia gets banned on Dec 9th
Earlier today I read that it's very much within the scope, and that St
Petersburg might even get stripped of its hosting
Either way, I hope we won't reach that
I'm looking forward to seeing our teams play
I'm not really sure
Guess we'll find out in 9 days
Funny it's the same in danish
It's official name is ambersand but it's mostly called 'og tegn' which is 'and sign' in danish
that everyone just completely close up after finding their group of friends during education
if you always had terrible classmates, or none that you related to, no luck for you then
Same thing here
As someone who’s still in school: is it really that bad :(
Huh that’s actually true for Denmark too, but for parties (with drinking) only
I don’t know why it’s so acceptable because it’s definitely not in other situations
you might get lucky if you join clubs, attend any social gathering you possibly can, and are very brave with approaching people and letting you goal be known to them
For me - high school was so much better than primary school
Kids aged 12-16 freaking sucks sometimes, but after that people do seem way more mature and open minded
That’s my experience at least
I strongly envy thata
It's not cool being the first to arrive
And in 48 days
It's definitely like that here
Most people start drinking somewhere in between 7th-9th grade, and by the time you hit high school, there are gonna be parties pretty much every 7-14 days
If you don't go, and don't drink, people are going to think that you're weird
It's very sad, but nonetheless, that's how it is
Beer in the shower, beer while getting dressed, then 5 beerbongs while your mates and you catch up before the party
Never heard of this
That seems way too forward for Danes to be comfortable with
They would probably just think "they must not like onions".
Why on earth would you put onion on a kebab
Here they say "mester".
His name is bossman
I'm kissing every day
But I never knew onion on a kebab was a thing
Salat, dressing and some chilisauce
'Nuff said
It's the bomb
Trust me
Copenhagen, the area was called "the Kings Merchant Harbor" for centuries, eventually shortened to "the Merchants Harbor" (købmændenes havn) - which became København (Copenhagen)
Because the danish king at the time wanted to build a castle and make it his town
Then it became the capital
Det rager mig en høstblomst
I'm not sure how to translate this
Rager: is rake or scrape
So directly translated it's something like "it rakes me a harvest flower". It's a pretty negative way of saying you have zero interest
A harvest flower, is an old term for flowers that bloom in autumn
Oh yeah, some people use papand instead of høstblomst, and that translates to "cardboard duck".
“Jeg er ligeglad” (I am equally happy)
“Det er lige meget” (it is equally as much)
"Spurgt", originally meaning "asked", became a way of saying "did I ask
"/"I don't care" in around 2015
It's mostly used among younger people
"Jeg er ligeglad" directly translated would be "I am equally glad/happy". That's how we express "I don't care". Doesn't really make sense in Danish either as far as I know
So one that isn't swearing: In Danish jeg er ligeglad, litteraly translated means I'm equally happy
It doesn't sound so positive though
followed up by yours grandparents with "så du aldrig glad"
\> for example, France longest land border is not in Europe, it's with Brazil in South America
&#x200B;
How about Russia
Denmark is one of the highest ranking countries for happines
But also one of the countries with the highest suicide rate
Also, us Nordics like our Christmas TV calendars
24 episodes of a (usually kids’) show each day in December up until Christmas
It seriously blew my mind when I learned that no one else had them
So do we
It's a Nordic tradition I think
And its damn good
> The Iraqi geologist Farouk al-Kasim discovered and helped us secure our oil reserves
Is he the inspiration behind the Sheikh in Flåklypa
In Denmark some also watch the Disney animation at christmas
Dinner for One is also a tradition in Denmark
Exclave
Yeah, definitely a trap
- People are nice, when they don't try to cheat you because they think you're a tourist
(that only happened in Valletta)
- The language is an odd mix of Arabic, Italian, and English
Your food is an equally odd mix, and it's awesome
(One lunch I had from a Pastizzeria:  Pasta and veggies in a creamy sauce with a dash of cinnamon, covered with a lid of pastry)
- Holy fuck, fix your roads
- I like that everything is super close
Which, I guess, comes kinda naturally
- It really shows it's size

Great novel taking place during hte Danish colonization of Greenland
For crime novels the "[Department Q] series by Jussi Adler-Olsen is quite popular, but for non-fiction I would recommend "[The ISIS Hostage] ("Ser du månen, Daniel") by Puk Damsgård
If you could read Danish, then I'd recommend Jussi Adler-Olsen
There's even a movie based on Journal 64, which is a book in the series
Fully recommended
I was recently gifted "Our ancestors" by Italo Calvino

"How do you do, har du slugt en flue
Meaning "Can I please use the toilet kindly sir
There's a great part in Die Hard 3 where the german(?) bad guys are trying to imitate native English speakers by using that phrase
The words can't even be translated like that tho
Whether "a" or "an" should be used is determined by the first letter of the following noun, where "en" and "ett" are random based on gendered nouns
We don't use nicknames
I certainly don't know anyone who do or any nickname-versions of another name
Especially among younger people, it seems fairly popular to nickname people with longer names by the first two syllables in their names
* Frederik -> Frede
* Karoline -> Karo
* Isabella -> Isa
etc
It can also be the last two syllables, e.g. girls/women named Sofie are often just called "Fie". When I was a wee lad, girls named Isabella often went under "Bella", but it seems have changed to "Isa" in today's kids
Danish doesn’t really have that many common nicknames but now that I think about it, we often just pronounce each other’s names in English to sound more lighthearted (or maybe that’s just me and my friends and family
anyone else do this
The idea that Facebook would back off the biggest market on the planet because of a rule change is prepostorous
Biggest market in terms of purchasing power
Only around 500 million people tho
Fucking disgusting of Facebook
Actually last year or was it 2 years ago, Facebook opened a new data center in Odense Denmark so would that be for  nothing if they stop operating
I wish
They won't, but Europe would be better for it
Facebook is poison
Shut that shit down
Instagram and Twitter too
And for the love of God, murder TikTok, and salt the earth

Hmm i still use it a lot well the messenger part of it at least
Ok, go ahead
>“Facebook is not threatening to withdraw from Europe,” a Facebook spokesperson said, adding that the court filing simply lays out how “Facebook, and many other businesses, organisations and services, rely on data transfers between the EU and the US in order to operate their services
Except they are not

I never use Facebook
"We support global rules on data treatment". I wonder how many times he had to stop himself from laughing out loud
Memes was never in danger in the first place
Somebody, like Facebook, just tried to spin it like that to make it seem bad to most ordinary people
GDPR is all about protecting your data and digital ownership - I.E. You can't just copy an image and sell it without permission
but let's say if they do leave EU, they've invested so much money in a data center for only a couple of years of use lol
You mean signal
But comrade, it is not your penis, it's our penis
I truly hope that the EU steps up to fill in the vacuum left by Trump's regime, as the forerunner of the western world and the safeguard of democracy
In all fairness, I've never heard of telegram until just now
Only knew of signal because of the Hong Kong protests
I don't know anyone that uses either sadly :(
I snorted ;-) Then was a bit saddened by how spot on that is
Sounds like the exact same point the Danish prime minister (Anders Fogh Rasmussen) made in a speech to the Arab world in 2005 during the Danish “cartoon crisis”.
Spoiler alert, it didn’t work and the point about not being able to legally restrict specific types of cartoons fell on deaf ears
Signing into law that portraying Muhammad is illegal, is the only thing that will appease them
Well, the point is that we need to be able to discuss things, and calling out racism and xenophobia is important for that discussion
If you are being called racist or xenophobe, maybe it's worth taking a look at your statements and try to understand how it might be seen as something different from "just stating the facts". Maybe not
Yeah, I can see why he might not be liked in France
But at least the take away from various newspapers is that France has stagnated and is in dire need of reforms
Of course, reforms are not always popular
His external image is however excellent
Perhaps he can can help unite the Europeans to take collective action against extremism
I had the same perception about French until, on a vacation, my dad asked me what language I thought the table next to us were speaking
It was a group of young people and I honestly thought they were speaking some dialect of German, because it sounded so harsh and ugly
But no, it was French
I fully agree that the words must be used only when applicable, and if someone calls you out for using them too lightly, indeed you should think about whether they might be right
It certainly goes both ways
There's nothing wrong with "attacking" someone rhetorically if you believe their premise or conclusion is wrong due to it being based on racism, or if you believe that they are arguing in bad faith to promote xenophobia
Both of these will invalidate the argument being made, and must be pointed out no matter what "side" you're on
EDIT: Let me just start by saying I agree with everything Macron is saying in this video
It seems maybe you think I am against what Macron is saying
> ...so every conclusion that involves race, is automatically wrong
no matter what
Of course not
Arguments based on biological race can be right or wrong, but arguments based on the racist ideology are only right if you subscribe to that ideology
Non-racist racial argument example:
>Our new medicine might have side effects on people with genetically brown skin, and ethnic Arabs tend to have brown skin, therefore our medicine might have side effects on any ethnic Arab
Racist racial argument example:
>Extremist Islamic terror has happened, and the perpetrators of such terror attacks tend to be Arab, therefore we should stop offering asylum to Arabs
The first example builds on the idea that there is a genetic difference between races, which is objectively true
The second example builds on the idea that this genetic difference causes all Arabs\* to be somehow mentally / morally inferior (in this case more violent), which is considered obvious within racist ideology, but for which there is no evidence
If you subscribe to racist ideology, there is nothing wrong with the structure of the argument
The statement "everyone has basic human rights" is an ideological idea, not an objective fact
But if you agree with that idea, you must accept arguments based on that idea
If you reject the idea, you must reject arguments based on the idea
\*Then there is the sort of secondary racism where people try to get around it by saying "I'm not referring to ethnic Arabs, but middle-eastern Muslims / Syrians / X", where X is some group consisting almost exclusively of ethnic Arabs
All things considered it is only the plug and that it can charge normally via that safely, so they can still do more above that
Absurd micro management
No I don't want the damn government to tell me which charger I can use, or limit the phones available for me to purchase based on what chargers they have
This belong in a Soviet Union dictate economy
What's next
Standardized computer monitor size
All must use 17"!
The phone doesn't tell me anything I can't ignore if I want
If I don't like it, I buy another
If the phone companies want me to buy their product they best make sure to make something I like, and which is better than the other options available
New innovative charging technologies might be one such thing
Or unusual phone design which does not allow for USB-C form factor could be another
Although not after the EU has dictated this aspect of course
Would a phone without any charger (perhaps only remote charger) be allowed by EU
The new legislation do tell me something which I cannot ignore even if I wanted
The government is simply limiting my choices
For my own good I'm sure they'd claim
So mandatory 17" computer monitor sizes next
Can we get standardized shoe colour also
Brown ought to suit everybody
Anyone can license the Lightning connector, they usually just don't because it costs money and USB-C and micro-USB don't.
> But the the law doesn't stipulate anything regarding a certain technology
That's because it's not a law
MEPs don't have the staff assigned to do detailed calculations on stuff like this, so they're supposed to write what they want (e.g. standardize x) and then the Commission (which does have the extremely competent staff) throws something actually workable together and bounces it back to the MEPs, who either accept it or ask the Commission to change something

See Utrecht, Netherlands for an example of how a city center can be reclaimed for pedestrians/cyclists
It's very nice imo
EDIT: [Example video]
Uh, cuz cars are big
That's quite misleading
There are also people IN the cars
The streets aren't just empty, unused space like that painting will have you believe
Yes, my god
It's kind of like Moscow
Dubai is even worse, except in Dubai you have overpasses instead of underpasses
There's hardly any traffic at all on that road, those cars are just for the people that live there
Here is [a video] of that particular street even
Cars are still allowed into the city of course (there are several important roads for the throughput of busses and cars), but the city is focused around being most accessible to pedestrians/cyclists
It's still an ongoing process, most changes have only come in the last couple years
I included a video about those changes in my original comment if you want to check it out
Well, that's an improvement

> A lot of people are saying that celebrity athletes are paid what they are paid due to them generating massive amounts of money
Pay is determined by what they generate but also how easily their skillset is replaceble
The people who produce Apple products are easily replaced despite creating a lot of money
A microbiologist create some money and has a skillset that is not easily replaced and the pay reflects the demand
A celebrity athlete might have a great skillset that cannot easily be replaced and also create lots of money for the owner which is why they can demand the pay they do
Its all about supply and demand

Fear is a useful and rational response to something dangerous like this
When people no longer fear it, they stop giving it the respect it deserves
They start mis-prioritising
Some of the people I know have started partying again, despite the fact the pandemic is still very much ongoing
I know most of them would have taken it very seriously 6-8 months ago, but now the situation has normalised enough to the point where they feel like boredom outweighs fear over something that is actually cause for that fear
We understand why, it's human psychology
Soldiers who go to war have a heartrate of a trillion the first time they hear real enemy gunfire in the vicinity
After a while they acclimate and adapt
That's what humans do
Unfortunately when we adapt, we don't always keep our good sense
I had a friend who went to Afghanistan, and he was often part of a group that went out and used a metal detector and other equipment to scan for IEDs
Eventually he became so jaded he would just step on stuff on the ground that looked suspicious, to see if it would blow up or something
It's kind of the same thing
He had never actually found an IED, in a long time serving in this role - so his brain just goes "It's not really a threat
". Even though he knew the ongoing statistics of how many soldiers (and civilians) were being killed by IED's on a regular basis
Eventually his buddy got injured from an IED and he took much more care after that
Unfortunately anecdotal evidence can overwrite the facts we have about the wider situation, in a persons brain
You might see, in your care home, multiple high-risk individuals get sick with the virus and be totally fine with no sideeffects, and then that will subconsciously warp your understanding of the danger it poses
But someone in a very unlucky care home where a whole lot dies, even young people - might draw the opposite conclusion; that it is more dangerous than it really is
The best we can do as humans is understand our own psychological limitations and how dangerous small datasets are
Then we rely on governments or other such institutions to gather the data and make objective decisions based on it
This wasn't targetted at you, by the way
I just had to get it off of my chest because I feel like people in my social spheres are endangering themselves and others by not adequately understanding this

"Unlike spears, nuclear bombs are only good to sit on". Unfortunately I can't remember who said it anymore
Aight imma move to Switzerland, they seem to know how to avoid war
As long as nuclear weapons exist, i'm very confident that we will never see a direct conflict between the largest world powers (USA, China, Russia)
On top of that, the world has changed in such a way that interdependency is so much higher today compared to the last time we had a great war because of globalization and international trade
War between the US and China, for example, is in no ones interest, even if you don't consider the potential of nuclear war, because of the way both countries economies relies on each other

I even took at day's tour to see the countryside the first time I was there; saw how clogs are made, their wooden windmills that are still used
Sadly didn't get to see the tulip fields, but I have heard they are mesmerizing
So yeah, even if I was a 24 year old broshit; and my mate even moreso, we both still enjoyed the city and the country
Hell, my mate didn't quite get why I wanted to do anything else but smoke weed, but he came around when I suggested we take the Heineken tour first

Pony or nothing

EU: Then you get nothing
UK: I vote against your nothing
EU: You really do not understand, do you
UK: I want more time to think about it
EU: For the pony or for the nothing

To change the politicians' minds, you need to change the minds of the people who vote for those politicians

The ocean step is probably the by far most important one of the bunch, because if the marine algae that produce 70-80% of all the oxygen we breathe today die, we're *all* fucking toast, not just humans
And they're dying because of the acidification of the oceans due to the increased amount of CO2 absorption and plastic pollution
And China and India are the worst offenders when it comes to ocean pollution
the oxygen in our atmosphere is enough to last us 5000 years, we're fine in that regard, and earth is fine too, it's been through highs and lows of oxygen multiple times
the problem is co2 absorption and retention which algae does a shit ton of

Why worry about something that is impossible

Based on the downvotes, I assume a lot of people don't get the similarity between Chernobyl and Global warming
5000 years is not a very long time in evolutionary terms
I mean sure, humanity would then have lots of time to colonize space or invent weather machines or something crazy, but our environment will then be literally on the clock, and there's nothing we can do to reverse that kind of damage
Good thing some people in this world will settle for something a little better than nothing then :)

I like how nothing happend to Denmark
Danish/German border isn't that far from the original
That's way to close to reasonable
Denmark's border is basically the same, so i'm fine with this
I'd imagine Bornholm would've been given to sweden though
Makes you realize how much effort has gone into making these countries
Not just the borders themselves, but everything that makes it possible for societies to live together
It's worth remembering this, when we look at war other places in the world
We ourselves might have peace now, but it took a terrible amount of work
Also worth remembering when people want to downplay the nation-state in favor of EU
It takes allot of work to make a peaceful semi-functioning society
If we want a good EU we better put the same effort in it

You used the wrong image for Denmark

The danish version is which one
Haven't seen that one anywhere else
I love the map
although it's the wrong image in Denmark (we are partial to the Kaj the Frog-Fi)
At first I thought this was wrong as I remember this being legal for a long time in Denmark
Turns out it was legal since 1989 to be in a same-sex civil union (married outside the church) in Denmark but the Netherlands did beat us to the marriage thing with about a whole decade
I hope equality, freedom, and happiness spreads to all

That looks amazing

Here in Denmark we haven't had a single day of snow through the entire winter
It sucks
“iT’s jUsT TEmpEraTUrE SWiNgs yOu gUYs, pERfeCtLY nORmaL”
In Denmark it’s raining all the time through, Nørrebro in Copenhagen has been flooded last I checked in the news
Yeah, it's freezing literally only in northern Scandinavia and central Iceland
I biked 8 km yesterday
The only negative was the strong headwind on the way home
40kph, or thereabouts
Except it's so stormy in Denmark at the moment, that it really feels like a solid -20° :]

And holy shit, look at the size of the area where temperatures are between 10° and 20° Celsius
In mid February
Good thing Hell is so nice and temperate now then
It's been a long time since we've had snow in December
But January and February have almost always had a lot of snow
According to DMI, Odense had records of 2,5cm of snow in 2019, 11cm in 2018, 4cm in 2017 so your friends memory seems to be not so great haha
I can't speak for Odense but where i'm from we had snow in the beginning of last year
I'm from Odense and your friend is wrong
We had snow every winter except this one, at least going back to 2016
I already mentioned Denmark
There's no need to add specific regions
That does explain the otherwise silly phaseout of the carbon neutral nuclear plants
Had a white Christmas here in Nordsjælland last year
Motherfu-..... Of all the places, the Devil Island gets a white Christmas
Well, we are tied with Vendsyssel when it comes to being the statistically most likely place in the country to experience a white Christmas
I think on average, there's about a 20% chance of a white Christmas here
Being so close to Sweden, Nordsjælland gets slighter colder than the rest of the country (except Vendsyssel)
My hometown actually received the first snow of the 2019-2020 winter back in early November
I live in Vendsyssel and it's been so freaking long since we had a white christmas
Parts of Vendsyssel had snow on Christmas Eve in 2018 (same as us
By last year I meant 2018, not 2019 haha)
Yea
And it gets more sparse every year
To be fair, white Christmases are very rare in Denmark
Since 1900, there has only been 9 white Christmases (more than 90% of the country covered in snow)
They happened in:
1915
1923
1938
1956
1969
1981
1995
2009
2010
That means that statistically, there's only a white Christmas in Denmark every 13 years, locally every 5 years
2009 and 2010 were absolutely crazy as a white Christmas had never happened two years in a row
Yes but as you say that is if you only count the ones where 90% of the country is covered
I remember several local white christmasses in the 2000s
They would have to be in the early 00's then
2000-2004 were the only locally white Christmases until 2009, and in 2002 the snow only feel in Sønderjylland
It's possible that Vendsyssel and the areas around Aalborg had snow in 2000, 2001, 2003 and 2004
That seems about right, but where can you see this information
With a little detective work, you can find articles published by tv2 vejret that sometimes mention previous snowy Christmases
Try googling "Hvid jul [year]" etc to get results

how about another Union eh
As a Dane I can say that people in Denmark did talk about the UK leaving EU as being a possible instigating incident to make us leave as well
I've heard it said that it would be appropriate that we joined the EU due to (our trade with) the UK and now we would leave due to the UK
>Also I didn't see them mentioning Austria or Denmark as likely candidates to leave, only Spain, Italy and Netherlands from the cartoon
[Well
Norway normally has their shit together
I think deep down, most scandinavians would like a Norway-managed Kalmar Union
At least I do
"It wasn't about slavery it was about money
'Easy for you to say when your ancestors weren't a currency
It definitely has
Personally i was on the fence before
I guess you could say i was scared straight
> Everyone here is talking about reforming the EU somehow
Everyone wants change
No one agrees what it should change into
The eternal problem of politics
It's a good way to promote unions
You could easily pass a law like that in Denmark and noone would bat an eye because if you don't have a union agreement you don't have employees either
u/kexes time to work
Look man, it don't work
How is this legal
Why again haven't we thrown Hungary out of the EU
Together with Poland and perhaps Romania
There wer two reigns of terror in France
One lasted half a year and saw 10000 dead
The other lasted many centuries and saw many millions dead
Danish newspapers are having a field day today
Saw [another one] on my way home, the title is a pun I’m a bit too tired to explain properly, but it’s basically combining “a bull in a China shop”,  “throwing rocks in glass houses”, and our nation’s highest honorary title of “knight of the elephant order” that’s often given to state leaders
So it says “[name of paper] bestows new honor on Donald Trump: Elephant of the glass store”
As a dane
I think its totaly fine by the news papers doing this
This is like when American liberals make those "The Queen of England makes Trump look like a dumb dumb"
The world's on fucking fire, Mette is too busy blaming refugees for all of our issues but at least we get to feel great because Trump saying an insane thing to get all of our eyes off of the actual issues in the world worked as per usual
By the by, there's concentration camps in the US and in China, and the Danish government has not denounced either
This news paper is actually slightly right wing biased
It’s a totally over the top front page - but guys
your president wanted to buy us
Calling BT a newspaper is an exaggeration - it's a tabloid at best
Altså han er en idiot
In the top right it says - train on womans breast
I would hardly call BT a newspaper
"Newspaper"
BT is a tabloid
Not exactly a newspaper
This is not stuff that the world nor Danish citizens need to be exposed to in this way
And also, there are no news here; we all know that this happened, that newspapers write about it isn’t news
That they do it in such a horrible, dumb way might be news
To anyone who would care to listen
DUMB DANISH NEWS SLANDER DONALD DUMB
Come on, get this off the front page
Everyone is getting dumber by the second and no one gains anything, not even the newspaper
That is some first grade rambling
Its like a mapping of a brain that is in free fall
Completely scattered
Expect lots of "Something is rotten in the state of Denmark". Good grief do American journalists love that one
He invited himself publicly with very short notice
He then received and accepted a formal invitation and the Danish government started the extensive preparations
Then Donnie threw a tantrum and cancelled it all because he couldn't have Greenland
To be fair, she actually called his *idea* absurd, not him directly
B.T. is just taking the usual tabloid poetic license
Time helps a lot, too
Some 200 years ago the Nordics used to not be able to go a year without some bloody massacre taking place, either Denmark doing it to Sweden, or the other way around
and often over Norway
Few countries indeed have warred as much, and spilled as much of eachother's blood, as Denmark and Sweden
But these days we're best friends, albeit the kind of friends that constantly tease eachother
Unless Football's on of course
then it's war
War with singing, and beers, and funny hats
Are there any ongoing conflicts in the Balkans
I know only some of the wars in the 90's, and have the impression that that was last when there was armed conflicts in the region
This is not a “Danish reaction” - it’s the reaction of a single Danish tabloid, which earns money from being as controversial as possible
In an American context I would call them more "racist moderate biased", but you're not wrong
,Egon
"Golf player accused"
"Grabbed woman's breasts"
"Torbjørn Olsen denies EVERYTHING"
For the Danish impaired
It's OK
We've had a good life
Valhalla awaits
Yes it is
Our prime minister called the idea absurd
That's it
Is that really "throwing a fit"?
We live in a socialist cupcake-loving communist hellish society where we pay all our money in taxes, and everyone can't even own an assault rifle
It's basically North Korea at this point
^^/s ^^in ^^case ^^anyone ^^is ^^confused
They are not wrong
Anyone that has been to Helsingør  knows the smell of rotting seaweed is offputting
Yup, and in this process we've wasted a lot of tax resources
Actually neither, we reject consonants out of principle so the Danish word is "Dum", but here it's the English "Dumb", which we then tend to over pronounce because why else is that b there
No, but Trump is often pronounced as Trumb in Denmark for some reason
No it’s the opposite actually
Wordfinal p/t/k is pronounced b/d/g. Wordfinal b/d/g is pronounced v(w)/ð/j.
Now you get why we're pissed
Yes
He mentioned off-handedly while talking to US media that after visiting Poland, he would visit us in Denmark
Then about 3 weeks later he mentioned on twitter that he was interested in buying Greenland
Greenland is part of the Kingdom of Denmark, though mostly independently run in all matters except foreign politics
Greenland's prime minister already said no  to the offer, and the Danish prime minister said that Greenland is Greenland's, so even if Denmark would sell it, we couldn't. Trump has the impression that Greenland is like an overseas territory or colony, which as empires used to do, could be sold and bought and traded
That's not the world we live in, and haven't been for generations
That is why in so many ways the, at the time, serious interest from Trump to buy Greenland off Denmark was, to quote our PM "Absurd". To which Trump, as the mature person he is, promptly called of his own invitation to Denmark, two weeks before he was meant to arrive
He was supposed to meet the Queen and PM, they were slightly offended by the double diplomatic slight of first inviting himself, and then cancelling for no good reason
I think our US-correspondent said that in international diplomatic circles, cancelling within 2 weeks is usually only done due to death or national tragedies and the like
I guess he could call for another state of emergency and use that as the excuse
Was just in Stockholm over the summer actually
So I hereby give you leave to buy all the beers you want
Make that Starköl, not the weak stuff
And maybe some bullet-shaped salmiak liquorice
Just remember to shout "The Danes are coming
" when the Systembolaget clerk asks why you need so much beer
do you mean wienerbrød?
I have no idea if you are right or not but most people on the far right claim they are not the far right
By who
We have right winged people in Denmark who aren't racist bigots
Those are not far-right
A typical Polish Catholic fundamentalist bigot i would consider far-right, yes
But it goes both ways right
Suggest anything left of center and you are suddenly considered radical left winged ANTIFA commie
I miss snow
Damn he's brave
Really brave
What did the guy do
Based Putin
Finally caught the Russian version of Rasmus Paludan lol
What an irony
“Oh it’s Independence Day
Let’s celebrate by honoring the people who wanted anything but independence for my country”
tf is wrong with people
Is that a joke right ??? Please tell me it is
it has to be
it's fucking 2020
Actually that’s Caesar’s salute
I mean you're not wrong, but Hitler kinda changed that
I searched about roman salutes and I found this comment:
"Most historians and classics professors agree that we really aren't sure Rome had a salute
Yes, as the photos show below, people's arms are out, but some are reaching, some were carved in that pose to show dignity, prowness, and even courage
The “moving forward general dictating his soldiers” thing was huge in ancient Rome
There aren't many, if any, mentions clearly by any ancient historians like Pliny, Tacitus or Suetonius
So it's all a guess
Seems like roman salutes are highly televised and historians are unsure whether the ancient romans acutally used it as a salute
I found out the first who officially used the salute was the italiens in 1920 when the facist party came to power
Correct me if im wrong
Wait ... Binface
What happens to Buckethead

Good on you France, you didn't cave to fear

what a relief
<3 thank you France

Why don't the French appreciate my Google translated memes
what memes
They were mostly Trump copies
> RIP European right wing populism
Every third French voter just voted for far right nationalism
She lost the election, yes, but her views obviously has widespread support in France
Haha
Try taking the train in Denmark anywhere else than Copenhagen and you'll feel differently about taking the train
God I love trains, this is my biggest wish
European countries needs to share common standards   and create a competitive market for train tech
But it's cheaper to fly, so why bother
Japan's Shinkansen is certainly used by commuters
Lots of them too
In the morning rush hours, the Shinkansen are so packed that some people have to stand up for long stretches
Also, a bunch of French cities (such as Tours) have a good amount of people who commute to Paris via the TGV
That can't be the entire story
It's about 3x more expensive to travel to southern europe by train from Copenhagen than it is by plane and you need to change several times + it takes many times longer
Edit:
Train infrastructure is a lot more expensive than it is for aircraft
It's an enormous investment for many countries
I can't afford to take trains though
I could then choose to not travel for the sake of the environment, but really how many people can be expected to make that sacrifice
I assume many Danes aren't surprised by how the US is doing, but given that this is in the wake of the whole Greenland/Canceled Visit Trump egotrip, I would assume that made the view even worse
Even though it is few people, I really wonder what made some people improve their opinion
Maybe they just dont follow the news
Am Dane, can confirm
But to be fair, that has been a constant for several years now
The more I learn about the US, the more of a shithole it appears to be
It's still a cool place in many ways but I most certainly do not wish to live there as it stands
[Sweden is like]
Let's not kid ourselves, the handling of the Corona virus is one factor
Ridiculing our Queen and badmouthing our PM is another
Trying to "buy" Greenland is a third
Increasingly xenophobic and nationalistic policies is a fourth
Increasing you consulate presence eightfold in Greenland after realizing a straight up "sale" is a non-option is a fifth
Corona handling might be the least important of these factors imo
DANMARK
DANMARK
Woohoo
Denmark
We're number one, we're number one, we're number one
Fuck
Yeah, there has been some serious Trump and USA hate going in Denmark
Now do one:
* Has your view of the EU changed during the Corona virus crisis
What EU
* Has your view of Denmark changed during the Corona virus crisis
You mean after blocking the EU rescue funds
* Has your view of Sweden changed during the Corona virus crisis
lol
* Has your view of Italy changed during the Corona virus crisis
Can we rename it Typhoid Mary
* Has your view of Spain changed during the Corona virus crisis
Are you guys allowed to leave your house yet
Can we call you Typhoid Mary's sister
* Has your view of Germany changed during the Corona virus crisis
How's the EU aid coming along
Pay up dude
I'm Danish and would have picked stayed the same, simply because it's what i expected would happen under trumps leadership
I have absolutely no faith in the US after they elected Trump
His world view only ever worked when information of the USA was scarce and filled with propaganda, like it was in the communist bloc
USA has always been a bully to it's surroundings and only a beacon of hope to their own citizens
Certainly not to the South American, middle eastern or Asian countries
Arguably not even to Europe, but they were instrumental to Europe's safety during the cold war
Pretty ironic he considered it a country to uphold civil rights when you look at the apartheid system that was present
Lad os håbe at amerikanerne svækker deres samfund indtil det punkt hvor vi kan invadere dem gennem Grønland, lol
Give us Rufus Gifford back, then we'll talk
I don’t hate you
I gotta admit, I'm in [this] camp, more than anything
You guys actually had me going there for a moment
Response was slow, and idiots were being idiots, but most people were actually dealing with it somewhat decently
Then a revolution started seemingly over the weekend, and suddenly nobody is staying home anymore, and cases
Happened again
Stay safe, mate
Oh no we love hating stuff
It's one of the reasons why we're so happy
You should try it
Typhoid Mary's whole thing was that she was a symptom free carrier
Considering how badly Italy and Spain have suffered from Covid-19 it's a pretty poor comparison
I texted a swedish family member actually
but they also didn't really have an answer to the difference
Maybe the view was already significantly worsened after the whole weird thing with the rapper incident and trump getting involved with the swedish justice system
Damn, I miss Rufus, guy was a true legend
Yeah, that gremlin Trump has put in his place is pretty awful
What about **Plague Rats** then
Has a nicer ring to it too
"*Are you going to the lands of Plague Rats this summer
*" "*Yes, i love pasta and death
In any case, super pathetic that Europeans are so desperate to look for failures in the USA, when there are plenty to look at, at home
Very few people actually hate Americans here
We hate your president, we hate your institutionalized racism, your nationalism (you call it patriotism) and your regressive religious views, but in general we get along great with individual Americans - especially if you're one of the many Americans who also dislike that stuff
empathy (or maybe I mean compassion
eh, either one) is not really your strong suit huh
Looking at the statistics, the USA is #12 in cases / million people
The only countries in Europe that are higher is Vatican City and San Marino
But they only had 12 and 698 cases respectively, so I think you are being a bit tough on them
Right now they are down to 0 and 3 cases respectively
You are technically right, but you are still wrong
Empathy with those that themselves show empathy
How do you feel the level off empathy with Americans are in this thread
By "here" I meant in Denmark
Other countries might be less American friendly, but I doubt you'd (commonly) meet outright hostility anywhere in Europe simply for being American
Well, maybe in, like, Serbia
It varies from post to post, but I see more people expressing dislike of Trump and a general like of the American people, and compassion with what they're going through than I see people making really inappropriate (and more importantly mean spirited) jokes about how many Americans have died
You're being a dick, and all the whataboutism in the world is not going to make that ok, so please just stop it
Dude, you need to read up on the meaning of "whataboutism". The issue is that a lot of Europeans here (and in the polled people presumable) seem to take a perverse pleasure in seeing Americans suffer
Doing the same to their own country and countrymen might show them the error of their way
Or not
Either way, unlike all those other people expressing genuinely nasty view of the USA, it doesn't take a genius to see mine only serve to express the point
When Europeans talk shit about America these days, you gotta understand that it's in large part directed at your government, more specifically Trump
People still like many things about America, we all watch your movies and your tv series, listen to your music, read your litterature, play your games, and buy your blue jeans
Many of us are even fluent in your language for this reason
American cultural influence on Europe is immense, and perhaps that's why we're so frustrated with your politics, because we can't really do anything about it, but it does affect us a great deal
No I don't. Whataboutism can be boiled down to: "Those guys are being dicks, so I should get to be a dick too
Why are you calling me out and not them
" It's fucking childish
Which would be relevant if I as an American was trying to deflect criticism away from the USA by pointing at other countries
But not when I as a European is trying to make the point that it is pathetic to wallow in the misery of others
Especially, when there is plenty of fuckups going around in our own house
whataboutism is "don't look at us, look at those other guys" (incidentally, pretty much what this thread is about) - it is not "look at yourself, not those other guys"
No, I'm saying you're using it to deflect criticism away from your own dickish behaviour
"I'm only being an asshole and making mean spirited jokes about Italy and Spain because those guys were assholes to Americans
" What you're doing is wrong, what they're doing is wrong
That just means you're not the only asshole in this thread
It was annihilation war Germany waged on Europe
It was war for German domination
People who were responsible for this didn’t had to be Nazis, many weren’t.

Didn’t his mother work in house of the Jewish employer at the time of conception and that is the reason of this rumor
Congrats
Maybe I’ve read bad news sources, but didn’t his party win the plurality of the vote
I’ve understood that he will only step down if his party fails to form a government based on the election results
Edit:
Dictatorship isn't decided by the existence of spotify and paypal
Montenegro has had innumerable elections going back decades where many parties are divided with shares of 20%, 30%, 40%, this doesn't happen in places like Putin's Russia (even with the fake opposition parties)
Or central Asian dictatorships
Or North Korea
I don't see how
ITT: People who aren't French and generally have a severely lacking understanding of a complex issue, overly simplify the issue and completely make up their mind based on that lacking understanding
>Turkey
>Europe
So in the half billion people of the EU, there's not a single journalist who received a prison sentence for DUI, shoplifting, or similar
Fiddling with numbers to reinforce your political point ought to be a moral sin in journalism, however correct your point might otherwise be
Its actually so fuccing annoying
Accurate
We already had it on r/Denmark ;(
Elections have consequences
Scotland deserves socialism good and hard, no doubt
Still you didn't secede when you could, the money was too good I guess
> I mean, the UK is fundamentally a socialist state so not much would change
Thanks to the scottish vote
> No, Thanks to the NHS, the police force, The Fire and Rescue Services, To the Care system
Denmark has all of these things too, if you're even Danish
No those are some of the causes of voting socialists in
Other causes are mass migration, a refusal to follow election results and so on
Denmark's Fire and Rescue Services are completely privately operated btw
Socialism is the first step towards communism
I know, socialism totally works, the others just did it wrong, this time we will get it right
You are cute when you are excited
Lets hope thats an O and not an A.

To be treated differently than the people that voted for her

What about Link tax
Why is nobody talking about that
What's that from

*Danish or Norwegian
Historians tend to disagree
Wasn't it the Danes
I was always told it was Danish vikings
There is a source detailing vikings arriving in England in 787 as well, but I don't know how accurate it is
DANMARK LÆNGE LEVE
Never forget that day the vikings saved the great treasuries of Lindesfarne from a great fire ️️️
Ay Norwegian weren't alone, this was a group effort
I prefer not to call them Norwegian, danish or Swedish vikings
Because it's all complicated with tribes and ancestors so I just call them Scandinavian vikings
I have heard these vikings being claimed as danish, Norwegian and Swedish
I hear that many monks were saved by the vikings and brought back to scandinavia where the vikings also helped them find work
"Vikings save treasures from monastery after monks die in hatchet-related incident"
The first episode or two, with all the stuff about travelling to an unknown land, is just so stupid
They knew fucking well that England was there
Danes had already visited in preceding years
It's not like Columbus crossing the Atlantic
Otherwise it's really well done
*You had some very bad people in that group, but you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides
Didn't they also make Roskilde Fjord look like it was surrounded by mountains
yeah, Lindisfarne is 793, but the first attack was in 787 already
Just not as impactful, and, more importantly, there wasn't a fucking chronicler present
Also, this is interesting:
>In fact, Lindisfarne was so full of treasure that the initial raid, and even subsequent ones, still did not impoverish the monastery
Eat The Rich, basically
I guess
Personally I’m getting tired of the current trendy Hollywood take on Vikings, and how historical figures and events are changed to Norwegian because it’s cooler
Not true, at this point in time the early Danish Kingdoms existed, although not united yet
The land of the Danes stretched from Jutland to Scania, and the people inhabiting them where referred to as Danes, also in the Anglo-Saxon chronicles
At least they made the location ambiguous by calling it "Kattegat" - feels a bit silly, but I can live with it
Wait, I wasn't the only one who was triggered by the blatant  Danish/Norwegian conflation
Them saying Kattegat with that super sharp accent all the time made me smile, tbh
It was fun
The word *is* derived from Dutch, being named by Dutch sailors
The Kattegat is a stretch of sea with many narrow passages, and at some times the navigable path through the Kattegat was less than 4 kilometers wide
Thus, it was considered a passage so tight that only a cat could pass through easily
Nowadays, it's one of the busiest waterways in the world
r/truecursedimages
We should make a religion out of this
No don’t
There's something surreal about this picture, but I'm not sure what
That man was fighting; you really have to give him credit for that
Same here in denmark
Hope you're doing well over there
Thank you USA
Ah, back to the status quo
Wonderful
The former prime minister of Denmark sent a message to Donald Trump as a response to Trump's way of handling his loss
Guess we'll see another war in Syria, Ukraine as well as a jihadi caliphate in Caucasus then
Congratulations on a great voter turnout, and a democratic process that is nearing completion
As a foreigner, it will be nice to return to some kind of normalcy
From a danish citizen
Didnt realise the US was apart of Europe
I think it's important European news considering Trump has been supporting (directly or indirectly) right wing authoritarians in Europe (and outside), like Orban and the the PIS party, which has been a lot closer to destroying the EU than Brexit ever could
And then there's the hold legitimizing of an otherwised sanctioned Putin and Russia
Thank fucking god, that short-fingered fucktard is out of world politics
Russia's goal has always be destabilization of the west
We can expect them to say whatever they believe will do that
Exactly
This is a bitter victory
Half the country is deeply unhappy
If they’re ignored again they’ll make sure another Trump gets elected next time - and next time he might be competently evil
Now is the time to *listen* to the plight of middle America
They’re not driven by racism, as is the media trying to claim
They’re hurting
Their jobs are gone
The cost of living is skyrocketing
Their towns are dying
“Suck it up” doesn’t cut it
“Just become a programmer” doesn’t work for a 50 year old trucker
Someone needs to stand for these people and help them, otherwise things are going to get worse
> political independence
Hopefully for smaller Member states aswell
We don't want to trade American Hegemony for German/Franco one
We still have Brexit to moan about
Why
Hopefully Biden doesn’t warrent the same critisism
We’ve been posting Donald Trump stuff for 4 years
Seems like a Good way to end that tradition
Let's not ask too much, It's the Americans we are talking about
They were part of the UK once i think
OMG what the hell happend in Bhutan
Yeah, Lukashenko might not have a foot to stand on when talking about democracy, but the electoral college / first past the post really is a mockery of democracy
It's honestly surprising, 'cause Slovenia is lowkey seen as the model Balkan state since there's been no scandal
That guy is an embarrassment
I don't mind Republicans, if they can produce an actual sane candidate
I never had any issue with McCain or Romeny
Both btw, were the only consistant critics of Trump on the Republican bench during these last years
We can tell half the country voted for Trump
If we believed the media, he’s an insane dictator and everyone hates him
Clearly the media isn’t portraying the truth
To some extent, but the Americans don't really ask as much of us either
So it's a concern :(
Who let you loose
Get back in /r/Denmark
It might win him the Votes in the swing state back
A moderate republican (who is actually a successfull Business man and Christian), might be something they are looking for
Time will tell
we might be back here in 4 years with President Hulk Hogan or something
TBH I'm worried of what'll happen without her at the helm
This is basically what the opinion towards the risks in Western and Eastern European countries
I'd commit voter fraud and elect her for a fifth term too
Me too
I don't get why Germany refuses to see itself for what it is, one of the most relevant and influential countries in the world
Calling the chancellor "leader of the free world" won't somehow revert Germany to the days of the Reich
Nah, whether or not someone's an ass is irrelevant to me as long as they have an agenda I agree with
It won't.
høhøhø lol :p
I mentioned voter fraud because I'm Danish and thus wouldn't be able to vote in German elections
>You can vote in our own elections
Not if you're not a German citizen
I was joking about his typo
Aah yes Occitania is the new Italiá !
*Sigh*

Also why does Greenland seem distorted in a weird way
That is hilarious
Even if it wasn't customary to do so, if he had signed and popped the pen in his pocket instantly and he was called out for it, he could've easily pulled "honestly didn't intend to do it, old habits die hard"
Oh he didn't do it as a joke
Ahaha what
Did he actually think he could just take it without anyone noticing with multiple cameras pointed at him
Pretty ironic, considering they want to join a political entity where the president isn't on election
as a dane i am actually shocked by how low denmark is
Like i get a lot of the others
I don't understand why the UK is so low
But here in Denmark, we use every single bit that isn't forest or a city for agriculture
Is the same true for the UK
Shameful :(
Denmark used to be covered in trees as well
Building wooden ships for a millenia sure costs a lot of trees
So the more trees, the less cultured a country is
Got it
Denmark so small the number doesn't event fit om there
Sweden: nice
spoken like a true dane
Kippis sauna Nokia
Also, Google Earth:
Farm, Farm, Farm, Grassfield, Town, Farm Farm - Oh, there's a tiny forest - Farm, Farm
>What's going on
Are they cutting down the trees to make farm land or something
Old nations
Ship building and farming in the 1600-1700 wrecked most forests
If look at Denmark, by the early 1800 only 2% of the land was covered by forest
So at 14% it's the highest it's been in over 200 years
The goal is to be at 20-25% by 2100 (Raising forests takes time
It used to be as low as ~3% in the early 1800s, which seems even more unimaginable
We had to import a lot of pine to stop desertation of Northern Jutland and to cultivate the Jutlandish heath:
> I dag finder man dog også en række andre fyrrearter i Danmark, visse i stort tal
De er indplantet fra slutningen af 1700-tallet, først for at hjælpe med bekæmpelse af sandflugten i Nordsjælland og Vestjylland, men senere også brugt i plantager på de ringeste jorde under forsøget på at opdyrke heden
Denmark has changed so much since then
It used to be very swampy and we eradicated our indigenous birch
There's a reason why the stork no longer visit
In fact, we've drained so much water since then that I personally grew up on a piece of reclaimed land that didn't previously exist 200 years ago
Probably why I equate the smell of pine with summer
I blame the British people for taking all our ships and cutting all our trees down so we couldn't build new ones after The battle of Copenhagen
Like where is that
I come from Fanø and i thought it was probably similar to your situation
But apparently not
During that time the people that lived there cheated wealthy people out of buying the island
I 1741 manglede den enevældige Christian 6
penge, og Fanø blev igen sat på auktion i Ribe
Denne gang var fannikkerne parat, og de frygtede andre købere - bl
a. herremanden fra Trøjborg og Ribes købmænd, som de i forvejen skyldte penge til
Det fortælles, at Fanøs repræsentant, Sonnich Jensen Møller, bestak en tjener til at dreje viserne på uret i rådstuen en time frem, mens auktionsholderen tog sig en lur inden auktionen
Derfor startede auktionen en time tidligere end annonceret, og fannikkerne fik hammerslag på 6000 rigsdaler
Kort efter kom herremanden fra Trøjborg, men da var auktionen færdig, og Fanø solgt til fannikkerne
Just forests
The goal to make as much as possible actual forests
But surprise, there are no actual numbers associated with this
&#x200B;
I don't much about Danish forestry . But the Ministry of Environment and Food of Denmark have a report (Danish) about the current state of our national forest program
> Like where is that
Frølunde Fed
It's close to the inlet where Vikings would sail up to Trelleborg
On really old maps it's pretty much all under water, even though the ones I just found from late 1700s on  does show it as little piece of land
> But apparently not
During that time the people that lived there cheated wealthy people out of buying the island
> Det fortælles, at Fanøs repræsentant, Sonnich Jensen Møller, bestak en tjener til at dreje viserne på uret i rådstuen en time frem
Haha, very sneaky
This also reminds me of Iceland and Norway
Both places has laws that dictates that about 30-40% of a company board must be women
However, the way I see it is that the law itself is discriminatory against both men and women
It is discriminating against men for obvious reasons - they might not get a job which they were more qualified for
The reason it is discriminating against women is that it assumes that women can't get the job unless they seriously handicap men
Choosing - and making rules, bases on the gender of a person is inherently a bad idea
The person, male or female, has to be chosen based on merit
"Positive" discrimination against one person is negative discrimination against the other

There used to be these ads run here, where they went to the US and talked about general facts-of-life stuff
Like "how many vacation days do Danish people get" or "the length of maternity leave" and the Americans are always dumbfounded
One that really stood out to me was the "how many vacation days" one because everyone gets six weeks guaranteed vacation and the dude replies "I get 64 hours" - like damn
The people are broken
New polls show that 70% of republicans still believe that the election was stolen
i mean that is just utter insanity
way too many danish people thinks its perfectly fine wtf
It was created at a time when the prevailing thought was "every citizen should have the ability to vote
But the poor might be too stupid and put their own needs above the needs of the state, so we need to do something to limit them
" Most other western democracies had similar stuff in their constitutions when they started out
Key difference is, *most* European democracies changed it because this idea that the wealthy are smart and put the needs of the state above their own needs is silly and also goes against the liberal ideas that spawned the democracies
Great Britain has some similar archaic institutions like the fact that there aren't elections for the house of lords
It comes from the idea that the poor needed to be contained
I don't think Biden would be stupid to compromise with his political opponents if he wishes to bridge the divide
You can't solely represent your voting percentage, which if I remember correctly, was about 51-52%. Then you risk alienating the remaining precentage of the population and possible entrench them further in their stance
I absolutely do not remember, it was a very long time ago
An NPR (National Public Radio) poll from last month
Should correct my original post “new” is not accurate
I guess except if you need an abortion
That is true, there was that conflict back in the day between whether it should be a "confederate" state where the states have far more power or a federated state where there is a federal state that has it's own responsibilities
However the idea of the electoral college and many of the limitations that exist(ed) in the voting process do in some part come from that early liberal point of view that the poor were too stupid, greedy or corrupt to be able to effectively govern or have a say in said governing
elected by Poles
I do not understand what the purpose of this post is
Why are we posting about a single individual that was killed years ago
The deceiving headline that is intended to make people believe that this is something that just happened is an indication of the motivation
This honestly just feels like political propaganda meant to frame a political group as victims, in order to garner support for their radical ideology
It would be the same as someone making a thread about a person that was killed by the far left or islamists years ago
I should note that I strongly oppose neo-nazis
I think it's a horrible ideology, but that doesn't mean that I'm automatically a fan of any political ideology that claims to oppose them, as limiting the choices to those two options is a false binary
PS: If you believe that antifascist isn't generally a radical political ideology, but simply a group that is against fascists, because they're called antifacists, then I would like to introduce you to the  *Democratic* People's Republic of Korea
Surely it must be a democratic country, because why else would they name themselves in such a manner
\*Looks to pile of explosives Danishly\*
It is something that happened 7 years ago, yet is being brought up here all of the sudden, despite the fact that there hasn't been any fundamentally new developments to this case
How did I Justify it
I literally claimed that I oppose them
I said that that neo-nazism is a "horrible ideology". I do not remotely condone what happened to him
You're trying so hard to set up a false binary, which I talked about, where any opposition or critique of antifacism must mean that I support neo-nazis, as if that is only two paths available
I feel like that would be an even bigger slap in the face of England
And I love it

How is Poland still in existance if this is supposed to be their best
Yeah - isn't it wonderful to see the voters represented /proportionally/?
In Denmark the liberals and the conservatives are not the same party
It works because of the collective intelligence of people
There will always be extreme outliers but the average opinion is pretty damn reasonable
The best compromise is always when everybody is unhappy about something
It really isn't. Absolute statements made about the incredibly complex nature of the world rarely is
It's merely his own bias showing through that he believes such a simplistic smear against his political opponents is accurate
It's simply the way he wants people to view it, instead of how it is
I was referring to his claim that "populism=covert racist", which isn't accurate
Populism is essentially a political method that simply means that you present yourself as being "for the people", which can occur on both the right and the left
The actual figure in the post is somewhat accurate, when it comes to the claims of socialism and covert racism, but it's slightly hyperbolic and obviously lacks nuance
>I assume you feel personally attacked because you support a party that the racist jibe is aimed at
No, i don't feel personally attacked, as the candidate i voted for is a part of the ALDE, which is the "centrism is exciting" group
I voted for the party which has a name that directly translates as "The left", but they're actually on the center right, because of the brilliant naming scheme of Danish parties
If i wanted to vote as far right as i could, then i could only go as far as DF (Danish people's party), which is a part of the ID group, which i presume is the orange (Liberal and conversative
) group
>If you don’t want these labels associated with your party, then you will have to convince racists to stop supporting your party
I think that's a poor argument
A communist, stalinist or marxist would vote for socialist parties, but i wouldn't label those parties as communist or stalinist as a result of that
I think it's flawed to try and define a political party around the worst of their voters
A political party is defined by their political policies, and if they aren't racist, then it's disingenuous to refer to the party as such
That's some scary elevation right there

Angela Merkel explains why opening up society is a fragile process
Credit for subtitles to [Benjamin Alvarez] on Twitter
This clip is not from a speech, she is responding to a question from a journalist
Thats what makes it impressive - Sadly, there is some context missing here, but she is adjusting her abstraction level according to the question, which is what makes this so good (in my opinion)
Anyone can memorize a speech, but to explain it on several different abstraction levels require a deeper understanding of the subject, which she demonstrates that she has here
Thats the joke

Victims of Stalinism and Hitlerism
Victims of Socialism and fascism
Or are you implying the only thing wrong with socialism was Stalin
Isn't 4th of May the celebration of the liberation of NL though
IIRC the Nazis surrendered in NL and DK on the same day
In that case it's not really a day of remembrance but a celebration of freedom I'd say
So you are excusing socialism, because the only thing wrong with it was Stalin
Please address whether or not socialism is wrong with or without Stalin

I really enjoyed World War 2 in Colour but thinking back on it it also seemed to be skewed towards the American agenda
To be fair
In 1945 people still thought the USSR were good guys that was helping again the bad guys

At least now we know the USSR were also bad guys

In the picture they reduced all fractions as much as possible, so I now have to compare 7/32 (14/64) to 15/64
Atleast keep the denominator consistent
Agreed, but we'd never get them to do that
64ths, however, is an easy change
Imperial is bad, sure, but this picture is also partly bad design

paté
I know some people who put jelly in them as well when they bake them themselves
I like to fancy them up with vanilla pudding, marzipan remonce and a tiny bit of chocolate
The only downside to making them yourself is the time it takes + realizing how much butter you're eating

Hi there Turkey
Did you call the activation number at the ballot you were given when first issued your new genitals
I’m sure your parents kept it around somewhere
There's no "Tom Cruise" on my search at all
It's a bunch of songs, then a "How do I find my Iphone", "How do I look", "How do I find my Steam ID" and "How do I update my drivers".
Yeah I can’t see our top English search being “how to meet Tom Cruise”
It's quite weird coming home from the Canary islands, to an even hotter Denmark
What we in Denmark like to call a “Danish summer” is somewhere between 18 and 23 degrees C with at least one rainy day per month
On particularly hot days we could hit 25, 26 or maybe even 27 degrees
In 2018 we had around 25 to 30 degrees with up to 2 months without rain
Where are the rainy danish summers I love
The ones where the grass was always green and soft, and no plants dried up and died because of the heat
We used to get snow during all of winter
Now we might get a week if we’re lucky and we temperatures barely go below freezing
Where are the white winters I know and love
I’m sure Denmark isn’t the only country that has changed over the past few years, and we’re probably not the ones it has the worst effects on, but people will look at how it has become visibly hotter and still refuse to believe in climate change all because there are profits in oil
Do they really think money is more important than our planet and her inhabitants
Or are they just so stupid that they can’t see the world dying
Either way they’re idiots who can’t see past than their own nose
Sorry, I didn’t come here to rant but it really makes me mad how ignorant and/or money hungry some the most powerful people in the world are
I hope you’re all getting through the heat
Remember to drink a lot of water and eat an ice cream every now and then, you probably deserve it

“Islam isn’t compatible with with European values” there I fixed it for you, sincerely an eurofederalist
They don’t have the balls for that here in Denmark
Until they realize they live in Central and eastern europe
Fuck Poland and Hungary, fuck eastern Europe in general, and fuck Islam
I’m so fucking done with this bullshit, downvote me all you want
I cringe when I hear the terms “defend our values and culture”. Who the hell is threatening it
This is a security and crime issue
Edit:
It’s annoying that in online spaces, you can’t say this without people assuming that you are an Islamic apologist and an open borders advocate
I definitely think that years of immigration without much concern for cultural and economic integration, coupled with a global network of extremism and conservative dogmatism in the Muslim world has been hugely problematic
But plz don’t give me that bullshit with “defending our culture”. How exactly is European culture realistically being threatened by Islamic extremists
Please tell me
Because the answer is usually some conspiratorial bullshit about Muslims wanting to take over the world
Which is not the case, if you look at reality
As I said - this is a problem which mainly concerns areas of crime, public safety as well as the economic burden of poorly integrated communities that are unemployed
The fact that right-wingers start yapping on about “erasing western culture” is a problem in its own right, and leads down to authoritarian roads just as bad as Islamic doctrine does
Edit2:
Please make a fucking argument if you are gonna reply
And let me state it clear: I DO NOT SUPPORT AN OPEN DOOR POLICY AND THERE ARE HUGE PROBLEMS WITH MUSLIM COMMUNITIES IN EUROPE
I am being downvoted because only THE MOST extreme opinions are accepted here
Decades of lax immigration policies and this is the result
So far
Every time you see boats ferrying people across the Mediterranean, EU demanding open borders, etc
this is what people should realise is the end result
I agree that Estonia is probably pretty good yes
I would like to visit one day :)
Please read my edit as I am tired of being strawmanned
I do not claim that values and cultures are not a problem
However, I am gonna object to the “very well defined” group- part
That is absolutely some bs that people tell themselves in order to simplify that problem - and therefore the solution
Do you have a point other than stating the obvious
I said “... without much concern for economic AND cultural factors” these two things are not mutually exclusive
Let me preface by saying clearly that I have a nuanced opinion on this, but integration would’ve have been relatively more easy if
We would’ve had a job market like the one in the Industrial age, in which unskilled labour was easily hireable
Instead, even being a carpenter today is a semi-academic education
My high school cantine employee was even an engineer from Egypt but couldn’t get his degree accepted
If the Arab world would’ve been stable, and if the most extreme groups would not be funded by Saudi oil money (+ Iran and others)
Having a conservative and dogmatic religion has ALSO been a huge problem, because it has created social control and isolated, parallel communities
But one must ask oneself, why hasn’t the Muslim world been successful in having a “reformation” and what would it take to achieve it
These are the questions that in the long run will make progress on a grand scale
In the meanwhile, we should have a restrictive immigration policy and an active integration policy which handles the roots of the problems we are seeing in local communities
There are a lot of young Muslims with potential that is ruined by both economic disparity, as well as the pressure and control of their own communities
We need to provide them with proper alternatives
That’s the discussion that will actually lead you to results, instead of talking about culture wars and what not
Well thanks for showing me the fine art of making an argument
And that's what we call proper outreach
People should not be scared when they see an officer of the law
It should not be that ''ohhh shit
'' feeling, they should be assured that there's people ready to defend and keep them safe if need be

No idea what's going on with the US though

The M3 and M4 lines are much more colourful than the M1 and M2 lines, though, while retaining the same overall minimal shape and style
I'd enjoy a bit more variation in shape, but honestly I find the new lines quite aesthetically pleasing
Haha, I definetly see it now that you've mentioned it, but the coolness definetly stands way above the London underground and even the cute Paris metro
Aesthetically pleasing, sure, but those seats that can only fit 1,5 person are a strange design
We actually only just got ours like within the last 10 years so it's not much of an achievement
Denmark
Are you actually European
In general, yes
I really don't know, but on all our other lines you can actually fit 2 people on those seats, so we've just halved the carrying capacity
Now that I think about your theory might be the most logical really
Well no, sorrt, but it's r/Europe so it kinda surprised me tbh
DK = Denmark
Ohh, yeah it's not like we memorize them either, but you just get very used to hearing and reading them in the news and stuff (probably also beacause of the EU) so we just asumme that abreviations like those are countries, and then you can guess your way to the specific country

Pretty much the exact same thing happened here in Denmark in various places,  Danish article but there's some cool pictures) all kinds of settlements and buildings all the way from the stone age to the viking age have appeared now
Restore the Austro-Hungarian empire
The street looks older than the Colosseum
Where are the meatballs
Multipla
oof, I'm not even Italian, but this annoys me on their behalf
Pizza was invented in Naples (Napoli) in the late 1800s
boys
boys
both kinds are amazing
it's rare to find good Naples style pizza outside of Naples though, whereas you can get decent Roman style pizza in most of Italy
The patterns on the Turkmenistan, Kazakh and Belarusian flag are gorgeous
Can Estonia into Nordic
The answer is the same
One of my really close friends is Georgian and I was supposed to go visit next month, but everything got corona'd :(
They are on the Council, but we do not grant them the rank of Nordic country
> Can Estonia into Nordic
What magical phrasing, ven
How goes the Corona Sweden
Dead yet
I was going for the r/polandball vibe

We're just helping you out with the herd immunity, giving ya a little hand in spreading it
You can thank our idiots later
This is fantastic
[This one is a bit blury] though
I think it's the flag of Norway with the symbol of Sweden-Norway in the corner, like [this]
The instrument in his hands is a [sextant] and it's used to messure the altitude of the sun or a star
It's for navigation
Edit: You can also use it to tell the time, when the sun is at it's highest
I think that's what he's doing
Norway was neutral during World War I, so no trench warfare atrocities for Olaf
There might have been some norwegian sailors who were hurt
If you want to know the exact moment, then there's no better method
Nah this is bullshit fuck the police
TIL that Berlin is called Berlino in Italian, which I somehow find hilarious
The people i've met from those countries have been quite friendly
So basically Eastern Europe and anyone who stops them from invading that
I wish the world was simple enough to just have a list of “countries that don’t like us” on the news lol
Lots of people buying into the USA neocon driven agenda of setting up Russia as the ultimate bad guys
I think ultimately they're afraid of closer European corporations and integration
We want to join the list too
The Russian ambassador to Denmark posted a [tweet] a year before the last parliamentary elections saying that it doesn't even make any sense to meddle in the Danish election, as the government will be russophobic no matter who wins
I see what you did there
Same for us
I really don't understand how we didn't make the list
We're NATO's gatekeepers for the whole baltic sea
We're one of the first targets that the Russian Navy would have to contend with if things got hot
In recent years aren't the UK trying to take down themselves
You’re just saying that because you’re Finnish
Looks like a road from one of those citybuilder games
lol, I thought it was Cities Skylines
I was just reminding myself to use this type of road more
&#x200B;
Then I read your comment
Gmaps should get a Nobel prize or something
Just drive really slowly and use the parking indicator and gps
And there's no snow here in lovely rainy Denmark
I'm going to Wagrain on Friday, seems like we have some snow to look forward to
Kinda crazy to see when we haven’t had any snow last for over a day here in Denmark
I looked up the density of snow
I guess this is settled snow which has a density of 20-30% of normal water
So let's say there's about 4 cubic metres of snow on the car, that's about one 1000 kg of snow
So yeah, quite a load
No snow in Denmark either
Five years ago we had snow to my knees
Had to clean the walk way every few hours
But climate change is a myth
Is this a thing
I get questions daily like “do you think it would be okay if I just went to” **bitch don’t leave the country
** how fucking hard can it be to understand
This is pretty funny
Have some fricking respect
Greetings from Denmark
I like the little figures hanging from string
Is this a typical room for a romanian girl, or are there certain things that have only been included to make it a bit more evident that it's Romania
Like the little flag or the picture of Jesus
Do you usually have such things
This is awesome
Remember when Clinton got in trouble for using the term deplorables, when she spoke of these garbage people
i wonder, can we make a campaign where we encourage the family to offset the bullies
Fuck People Who threats Thunberg or her family
Why would you make threats to a Young girl and her fam, just because she is trying to shed light on a very very pressing matter
Just don't get it
All
Why are people who don't love her automatically "scared" of her
They can simply be annoyed that she's repeating the same non-points over and over and for some reason she keeps getting attention for bringing absolutely nothing new or profound to the table
If she were anyone but a teenager, she wouldn't be getting any attention
That is effing great collective behaviour from the Belgian public
Good job <3

In case you've always wondered why "maneuverability" would be important when picking the correct gun, I guess this proves very well why rifles are not always the answer
I would say this is successful training
Now he knows this can happen
Probably won't do it again
Anyone got the link to the video
I'd love to /hear their reaction to the rifle getting stuck
I don't know
Isn't this military (as opposed to police)
In which case they should be training with the weapon that they'll be carrying around in the field
That's a lot of real fake doors
You should crosspost this to CringeTopia
Those are the special forces for sure
I'll just be enjoying my 15 degrees and rain, thanks
Meanwhile France is deeply involved in its former West African colonies militarily and monetarily
Smart
Completely inaccurate; those are pistols, real Americans use fully automatic assault rifles
Richest country in the world
surely you have the money
It's hard not to, when most European values straight out contradict US values
> It was common then for schools to offer extracurricular activities like marksmanship
That's still pretty common here in Denmark, at least in the area of the country I'm in
Although you can shoot pistols it's harder to get into and more expensive since clubs typically don't have any pistols you can borrow, just rifles
Typically you pay a monthly fee or a 1 time fee for the year/season and then you pay a bit of money for ammo each time (just a small amount since .22LR doesn't cost much) and then they have competitions once in a while where kids from across the country compete in it
Honestly a great sport
Teaches you discipline and patience and although not relevant everywhere in Denmark, in my area at least the general weapons safety knowledge/respect is great to learn too since a lot of people around here hunt
It can almost reach the other side
Their Gripens have no chance
Well seems like a good idea
No other countries have fought as much as them
Yeah, it's our newest, most expensive artillery
As would you, if you had those fuckers as a neighbor
We’ll never truly trust them
SÅDAN DET SKAL VÆRE, NED MED SVENSKEN
Of course
Det sådan man holder styr på dem
In our defence
They are tricksy bitches
Just in case
Indeed
We are very worried about the Swedish invasion
It's basically our No
1 foreign policy priority
Cannon taxation is sound policy
Also, thanks for knowing the real reason there
You good
Exactly
The other side was also Denmark back then, and the cannons can shoot about half way across, which is why theres a similar (albeit way less impressive) fort on the other side
I had to get a friggin' passport traveling through Sweden to Ystad so I could get to Bornholm
Reason
Grenades had been used in Malmö and ~~Swedes thought they were coming through from Denmark~~ concerned about where the grenades were coming from, Swedes upped border security
EDIT: [Hey, there's a whole wiki page about it]
You shoot at ships if they don't behave
When these cannons were put up ships had to pay a toll to the Danish state to pass through the Øresund
In those days we had guns on the other side as well - consider it a trade tariff
Oh if they don’t pay for passage through Øresund they were shot down, that’s how you control traffic
Remember these cannons were in commission when there were solely wooden ships on the sea
I thought Sweden had signed the Chemical Weapons Convention
Barsebäck was surströmming all along
Population is around 5

Nope

Depends on the country
Europe didn't develop uniformly
In italy
Sure, it's well after
In Denmark
In Denmark the medieval period is from 1066-1517/1537 so no
Not sure what the period is usually defined as in France, but probably earlier than 1509
\*shrieks in Malagasy\*

If you want to have nightmares for some time you should look up the picture taken of Mussolini's body/face after this mob lynching
Some British photographer snuck himself into taking a pic if I recall corrrectly
I wish I never saw that picture
This ain't a YouTube comment section, get outta here with that shite
And also please don't wear any headphones, not hearing anything can really distract you
And stop being on your phones ffs
But the visibility is pretty much the worst, it really removed any chance for the driver to help you
Last winter I almost backed into a bicyclist when reversing out of a driveway at night
I did not see the kid at first, he had no lights on and was wearing dark clothes and hood, but I faintly spotted a little light on his face which was reflection from the phone he was looking at
When shocked I got out of the car to see to shout at him, he removed his white headphones to just say a lazy "what
" before driving away
So, to sum up, that stupid kid was cycling down a dark driveway, wearing dark clothes, was listening to music, spending more energy on reading what was on his phone than watching the road and had no lights on
Fucking idiot
Lmao poo bear in the corner
USA are mostly mixed European - more than Europe which still stick to many nation states - so if shouldn’t surprise that US movies have broad appeal

My local newspaper's cartoon of the day was exactly like this
Their ’logic’ is that the pig indirectly represents the HK resistance towards the mainland
I thought the Swedish national pizza was the one with Bearnaise sauce on top
Here in Denmark we put salad on it aswell
Got to keep it healthy you know
Why do Sweden always get credit for this
It's not like they're the only ones doing it
The stuff of dreams
in denmark kebab pizza is this, but with lettuce, tomato and cucumber
its so fucking good
this doesnt look too bad either
Most pizzarias in Scandinavia  are owned by either Turks or Arabs
The beauty of it is that they have no respect for Italian tradition, so if you can think of a pizza I guarantee it's on a menu somewhere
Same here in Denmark
shit jeg kunne godt spise en salatpizza med kebab lige nu
Just moved to Germany couldn't be happier
Dane here, we could call them the summer germans, but it would be a different reason from the russians
Germany be out here scouting for possible weak points, before their next move
I wonder this would look pr capita as this just says there is a lot of Germans
huh looks like the nazis got their wish of lebensraum
I would love to see that
Finland doesn’t exist
As another non-artist I completely agree, I still remember having to draw the Portuguese flag in school for a project on other countries and even that one is fucking hard to get even remotely decent looking when you have no artistic sense at all
That was like 30 years ago btw so the horror of trying to draw it really stuck with me
Det er en død hest
Wtf i was joking, and i got 27 downvotes haha
I tried drawing Wales' flag once
Didn't go well
Yes, it's a beautiful flag but I just can't draw it myself
Hey, I have been there

As a danish tax-payer I am generally pro-EU
But having to pay taxes to transfer to proto-authoritarian regimes like Poland and Hungary, makes my blood boil
I would rather we leave the EU than support wanna-be dictators
What will this men for the average Joe
So the useless commission is going to oversee this
We are doomed
It would be a counter weight to Germany/France too
I hope it didn't get watered out too much
Overall I feel the EU is a great positive force and is happy to pay
But having too many parasites inside the system weakens it
Yeah, there are problems in many countries
At least transfer funds is a good means of keeping up the pressure
I am all for european solidarity
I think it is both compassionate and common sense, in that it is a good long term investment
Thanks mate - I love Poland and the Poles I know
Poland has so much potential
But electing this government - grrrrr
I'm honestly more confused now
Nice to finally see Europe waking up
Nice bait but ill bite
No one is doubting (except internet trolls) that everyone is opposed to Islamic terrorism and decapitations
Despite being in 2020, however, there is still systemic racism towards black people and other minorities and, in case you weren't aware, there are also black people in France

Seriously, leaving the EU was the worst political decision in newer time
I cannot fathom that it actually happened
I think it’s a huge problem we generally don’t trust our politicians, as it leads to more incompetent people in politics through extremist parties
At the same time you have to ask how you could ever trust any of the lying sons of bitches
That's just Boris

Crazy how nature do dat
You are right
I live in Denmark, which generally gets warmer summers and milder winters than the rest of Scandinavia, but this summer is exceptional for all of us
Yes and no, someone much smarter than me on the subject eplained it a few years for me
Bassicly when you get a shitty winter like we just had in the area, you get a hot as fuck summer
There is like a field that moves from the north and it rotates a bit and when it hits us with a shitty winter it will hit with a hot sommer almost every time as well
But it has still been a bit more than extreme here, we already got more "summerdays" than the past 3 years i think
Hah yeah or waterbottles for 20kr a piece
I live in København and it has that humid warm air from the sea and the heat radiating back from the asphalt that combined makes it feel 5-7 degrees higher than it is at times
Nah it's just that hot
There will always be people who didn't think to bring enough water in this heat and who cba to walk to a store
No, Dane born and raised
I just spend too much time on the internet
\*Cries in danish\*
Bruh why is everyone shitting on Denmark in here
Without us you wouldn't have lego or Hans Christian Andersen >:(
Denmark just transmformed from 1 peninsula and 2 Big Island into one blob and a weird ass Island
And we The Got The T royale
No strong opinions about Danes, I see - we're just boring and uninteresting
Looks like they nailed us to a T... uh, 丁!
They just ignored Denmark
guess that’s a kind of impression as well
they really just love ignoring us

When I lived in america there were a lot of times where I'd point to Denmark on a map and the reaction would be "isn't that Germany
Oh wow, I always thought that was Germany"
Another one was when I'd tell people that I was from Denmark, way too many would respond "oh, so you speak dutch
And don't get me started on the swiss/Danish flag comparisons and mistakes
Denmark
It doesn't help that Slovakians call their country Slovensko, and their language slovenčina
"I mean it all used to be one country, so it can't be that bad"
The classic one for me is that Denmark is the capital of Sweden
>**Volapük** ([/ˈvɒləpʊk/] in English;[\[2\]] [\[volaˈpyk\]] in Volapük) is a [constructed language] created between 1879 and 1880 by [Johann Martin Schleyer] a [Roman Catholic] priest in [Baden] [Germany] who believed that [God] had told him in a dream to create an [international language]
det rene volapyk
I live in Denmark and while yes, volapyk is used, I've definetely heard "Kaudervælsk" at least twice as much
(Also it is spelled volapyk, with y not u. \[no actually u is right\*\])
Vælsk meaning a welsh (aka
non germanic) language
Kauder is derived from the town in Switzerland that is now "Chur", so basically Kaudervælsk is just the romansh language
Edit\* I'm dumb and didn't think about the fact that the word had been translated to english, so the u is right
Is "volapuk" an English version
Here in Denmark we say "volapyk"
I've literally never heard this phrase
Gibberish is usually the go-to, isn't it
Volapyk*
Right
We use Greek or Latin for this as well btw
until i saw this post i never knew volapuk was an actual language
Volapyk*
Ain 't no danish word got no dots over no anything
Volapük? Er det en by i Rusland
Oh i see, that was dumb of me
I didn't think about the fact that all the expressions had been translated
Ja ich glaube das dänische Wort kommt aus dem (Nord-)Deutschen, so ist es jedenfalls oft
That's all fine,  but then why just "U" the first time
Yes it was an attempted universal language that failed, hence the Danish expression
That's because Esperanto borrowed a lot of Romance- and Germanic-derived vocabulary directly, whereas Volapük twisted the words a whole lot in an effort to make them divorced from their parent languages, so that it wouldn't be as eurocentric (due to being intended as a language for the whole world)
Haha
Christian sellouts ;-)
ATM machine needs a PIN number
After reading the press announcement of the approval, I don't think it sounds that bad tbh
It will of course depend a 100 % on how the rules are implemented and whether companies are able to find loopholes etc
I haven't been following the subject that much, so I might be mistaken and the press announcement is of course going to make it sound more positive than it is
That being said, I think this paragraph seems positive:
> Currently, internet companies have little incentive to sign fair licensing agreements with rights holders, because they are not considered liable for the content that their users upload
They are only obliged to remove infringing content when a rights holder asks them to do so
However, this is cumbersome for rights holders and does not guarantee them a fair revenue
Making internet companies liable will enhance rights holders’ chances (notably musicians, performers and script authors, as well as news publishers and journalists) to secure fair licensing agreements, thereby obtaining fairer remuneration for the use of their works exploited digitally
If it means that e.g. Youtube has to take more responsibility regarding their copyright system and be more active to ensure that it doesn't abused like it does today
When did EU become this piece of trash system
Was the original intent not a trade alliance or something like that
And now they censor our internet
They recently forced a change in the danish law as well, branding some of the maternity leave parents share, to the father
No one in Denmark wanted that; the system is already fine
This is not what EU is for; stay away
Go back to being  trading Union or what ever the original purpose was
So disappointed in the danish MEPs
Most of them voted for article 13 and no to amendments
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
i don’t understand why anyone would want this
I tried compiling a list of danish representatives, which political party they belong to and what they voted
It will be structured like this:
NAME (PARTY) (VOTE ON AMENDMENT/VOTE ON DIRECTIVE)
Margrete Auken (Socialistisk Folkeparti) (YES/NO)
Bendt Bendtsen (Det Konservative Folkeparti) (NO/YES)
Ole Christensen (Socialdemokratiet) (NO/YES)
Jørn Dohrmann (Dansk Folkeparti) (?/?) He has possible gotten misspelled in the PDF, not entirely sure
Rina Ronja Kari (Folkebevægelsen mod EU) (YES/NO)
Rikke Louise Karlsson (Independent) (YES/YES)
Jeppe Kofod (Socialdemokratiet) (NO/YES)
Morten Løkkegaard (Venstre) (NO/YES)
Morten Messerschmidt (Dansk Folkeparti) (ABSTAIN/YES)
Morten Helveg Petersen (Radikale Venstre) (NO/YES)
Jens Rohde (Radikale Venstre) (NO/YES)
Christel Schaldemose (Socialdemokratiet) (NO/YES)
Anders Primdahl Vistisen (Dansk Folkeparti) (YES/YES)
Crap this is depressing
Please correct any mistakes you find
Fuck
Smart move

Alright, anyone wanna help me carry 348 eggs
It's the same shit every time, not just the internet
The politician also decides the rules for the climate, traffic etc
etc
without letting the experts decide what will be the best solution in each area
I personally hope that Article 13 will mean that sites like YouTube have to be more active regarding copy right strikes so that the system doesn't get abused like it does today
> Who cares about 5
1 million+ signatures on a petition
That petititon was about Brexit, right
The problem isn't YouTube filters, it's that this is essentially pissing on freedom of expression
Yes, they've excluded memes, but the people that try to define this shit don't know what the hell memes are
Policies regarding the internet should not be made by people who don't know much about it

Actually that’s Sweden discreetly surrendering
Norwegian resistance was absolutely brutal, second only to the Finnish
There were a smaller danish liberation Army in sweden at the end of the war  - i presume - if the Russians came closer to mainland Denmark - the Germans would have sailed them to Copenhagen themselves :-)  Bornholm wasn’t that lucky - and were bombed before the Germans accepted to surrender to the Russians

Stayed out of Denmark
Good thing too
Don't want that sort of wankers here
'Cause Brexit was basically built on lies, and holds no ACTUAL benefits for Britain
It's also a massive hassle for British expats living in the EU, Which have to go through citizenship tests, now
Sure, for sorting
But I'm not going to tell somebody that I have an event on ''2019 in April on the 20th'' when I can just say ''20th April''.
But then it's just MM/DD, and we're back to the start
Oh, well
Only literally everyone I know
Saying ''April 20th'' here would leave a lot people confused at first
Here in Denmark, it's ''20th April'' in speech and writing, and so, I would imagine, it is in other countries that use DD/MM

Lago di Garda is absolutely lovely, *especially* outside the summer-season
I've spent countless Easter and autumn holidays in Moniga del Garda not far from Sirmione
Biking around the lake is highly recommended, if you like cycling
I've done it a couple of times, takes about 5 hours
A pit stop in Riva del Garda is a great idea, it's so beautiful at Piazza Catena
Other recommendations in the Southwestern part include Salò and taking a trip up to Lago d'Idro, going up from Gargnano and past Lago di Valvestino
> The Vittoriale degli Italiani is an amazing place to visit
If you continue up the small road, you'll eventually get to a little village called Serniga
There's a brilliant view from there
And if you continue from there, you'll go down Via Panoramica towards Salò, there's a couple of great viewing spots from there

The most fascinating and Dutch thing to me is that they remembered to include the bicycle path next to the motorway

3rd highest ranked nazi
How did you arrive at that
Maybe you should stop accusing others and focus on your own history and people
Nazis were German supremacists not some international group
That massacre like many others was carried out by your state and people not some unspecified group
Oh, I’m sure you knew
You’re just trying to make an impression that Nazism was nothing special, that it was not related specifically to your country and people which is a lie
Racism, war crimes, genocide are not unique to Germans, that’s true obviously
But Nazism was
Nazism was about German superiority and domination, about Labensraum etc
Are you denying this
All those movements you’re talking about are some fringe groups, few mentally disturbed people not representative in any way
Oh no

I'm sorry if this is misrepresenting Belgium like that
I think the main part is that so many europeans have *felt* the road difference in Belgium
I've felt it twice, once it was so hard we had to slow down because the road was so terrible
But it wasn't crossing in from the Netherlands
It was crossing from from the Flemish region to the Walloon region
And knowing the sort of history of it all made the moment pretty potent, honestly
Like, a visible line between the regions
Look at this fuckin' 80s guy smiling at the hottest girl in high school

Lots of apologists everytime
It is still state TV and a fucking disgrace for a western democracy
Poland and Hungary are banana republics in the EU
Do you honestly believe that DR in Denmark, SVT in Sweden and NRK in Norway are no worse than this garbage
If so you are very delusional
You are obviously a smart guy, but many other poles are not and cannot see that this is not objective journalism
I honestly have no fucking clue how to don't see this as problematic
Good aim and slingshots

Morning buses in Denmark are the best
Complete and utter silence
Unless friends meet, however they are usually respectful about it
3rd: drink alcohol
In the 10 or so years I’ve been taking the morning and afternoon bus for school, this is exactly what I’ve experienced with no exceptions
Haha, yes this so much
I always study on my morning ride, with the quite radio in the background
Hahaha this happens so often on my morning commute as well, and it's the most awkward thing sitting there, with nobody closer to the driver doing anything
I can recommend this movie if anyone's interested:
Well, it's a Pepsi light
And she is rather slim compared to most americans for instance

4 years ago our minister of science in Denmark was a creationist

We've had ***no*** snow in eastern Denmark this winter
It's depressing AF
I feel you
During one of my last classes in December the sun shine briefly outside
Legit everyone was staring out the windows enjoying the brief moments of sunshine before it retreated back behind the clouds
Yeah ... For a week in February if we're lucky
Winter started a month ago
But snow usually starts around mid november
It rarely stays for long though
Winter starts on December 1st
Winter solstice was on December 22nd
Interesting
Certainly explains the confusion
To make it worse I found this as well
> and in Scandinavia, the winter solstice is traditionally considered as midwinter, with the winter season beginning 1 November
Makes it rather confusing when communicating across borders
Nah, we're pretty much in the middle of it
But it's been a mild one this season
We once visited Taranto on the east coast (2012)
We were travelling the country for a couple of weeks, started of in Napoli and wanted to cross the country (we had seen other parts of the western part before) and thought why have we never heard of Taranto
Now I know
Before that I imagined all of Italy being beautiful
On the way there the bus was pulled over by police and everyone checked
The two very friendly young officers questioned me and my partner (2 Danish guys) a little about our plans in Taranto when we said we were just on vacation
I think they were initially puzzled with the answer but clearly realised we were just very random in our vacation picks
As I recall they smiled and wished us good luck with that
But plus side: We got to see nearby Lecce - maybe because of the contrast to Taranto I vividly remember a wonderful sunny day in charming Lecce
Probably worth it all
I was gonna comment that it seems like a rather small town to have a wall around it
But it seems it was more of a castletown
We knew nothing
Often we would research a little but on a 2-3 weeks vacation we only plan the first days and then with a broad idea after that (and a departure day and place)
We just looked at the map - and thinking like people in this thread that all cities in Italy were at least partly beautiful
At the train station when we were desperately trying to get away again, a guy approached us when he heard us speak in Danish
He was half Danish and half Italian (from Taranto)
He seemed amazed too we were there
Unfortunately he could not help us, it was a Sunday and no trains
We ended taking a very long taxi ride to the next city (which was wonderful again)
But in a way I don’t regret it
I don’t think travelling is about only seeing the most beautiful places
I think it is also about seeing the country as it is
I think it gave me a better understanding of Italy
Certainly a more nuanced one
For instance about rats on the polluted beach where children were playing half naked
It seemed surreal
I actually think we had the same logic and it was part of the reason we went
But yeah names can be misleading (Greenland enters the discussion - though beautiful, the name has not been updated)
Maybe you are right
I have not seen it all far from it
I can just tell what I saw and felt
And the reactions we got from Italians
If you wanted me to learn more you should probably have continued the discussion in English (or German, French or Danish :)
I don’t speak Italian
The Hagia Sophia is in Europe

These northern europeans butchered it
I understand that it raised some debate when the zoo animals' union succeeded in negotiating three months of paid maternity leave for rodents
> A few months back, red panda escaped from Plzeň's zoo, it was hanging out in the city for 12 days
[Red pandas] are so much cooler, and cuter, than those stupid black and white pandas
Red pandas deserve to be the symbol of the panda name
Funny
In danish you can’t call the animal that live in the middle east for a camel
It is called a “dromedar”, which I assume comes from dromedary
In the same way the Bactrian Camel is just called a “kamel”.
I am not sure if it is because of this small linguistic difference, that I find it really strange that people confuses the two animals
It seems like confusing horses and cows to me

Today we still get like 40% formality in emails/letters, it’s insane how self absorbing it sounds
It's a corn-blue colour
Everyone is afraid of the supposed WMD's under Putins desk, legitimate reason to fear going against him outside politics imo
edit: I get it, I know russia has WMD's, I was playing it safe because I'm not an expert on these matters
I'm a lazy college kid who plays vidya ffs, not a military strategist
Denmark on the front page, we did it
Its a hairy problem fur real
I'm embarassed for my country
This is no better than the open-air markets in Wuhan
Why has this industry been allowed to survive for so long
We have not yet received any news about a second lockdown occurring
This should be removed from the title
The world next year: It didn't work, all of Denmark must be killed
Maybe I'm just dreaming of an easy way out
Luckily, all minx are still safe
Those damn north Jutlanders infected with Mink
As if we dont have enough furries up here in the north
&#x200B;
Also, Ive never seen danish turned into engrish before
&#x200B;
I think its very sad that all those minks have to be killed
I also havent seen any definate replies to how we are going to compensate the mink farmers who I believe will lose their livelyhood and their breeding stock in one fell sweep
Im assuming since this is denmark and no the US, that there will be an economic net to catch them, but its still a tradegy all around
I think the first sick mink were discovered many months ago
I guess they were hoping things wouldnt get to this point
I was sat at home eating leverpostej when Mette ring
'Mink is kill'
'No'
Some journalist tried to coin that during the press conference
She was shut down immediately
Afaik it hasn't made the virus more or less lethal
But it has changed the outer 'spikes' of the virus
This can cause potential vaccines and anti bodies to be less effective
But keep in mind I'm just a pleb with no education/special knowledge within the field
Afaik they’re gassing the minks
The goverment is throwing everything at getting the job done, including the military
Pretty sure it’ll be over relatively fast
I can clarify for you
Almost all mink fur is bought by Chinese consumers
Without the Chinese demand, a lot of this mink industry wouldn't exist today
Unfortunately if there's demand there's always gonna be supply
> Hope this shit closes mink farms for good
Totally agree
I came upon a closed down mink farm not far from where I lived as a child, that shit was horrendous
Rows and rows of little cages
That's no life for any mammal
We started doing stuff with the mink and killing mink several months ago
So stuff was done, obviously not enough
Frankly, nobody except the mink farm owners have been interested in the issue
The public debate has just been like animal activists that are sad the minks ara killed and then the farmers like "but our money
", but nobody else has bothered much about voicing an opinion
You need to shut it or we'll stop producing bacon for you
Of course it's better than the open markets
They actually have very high security standards
But birds are suspected of having carried it in there
The open markets in Wuhan have 500 different species of live animals stacked on top of each other
These are american mink
Army and police are deployed to ensure the killing is done as swiftly and efficiently as possible
Don't forget Xi
But yeah, this is a fucking mess
Not to mention the cruel state of mink farming
How hard did you need to laugh
> Unfortunately if there's demand there's always gonna be supply
I heard today that the demand is actually kind of brought on by the mink industry itself, by having a pretty big focus on marketing, not sure if that is true but i imagine so
As my dad just pointed out to me: the real unspoken fear here is that our pig population will get infected
This pandemic really is the strongest argument for veganism I've ever seen
>There's a demand for human kidneys but as far as I am aware Denmark doesn't farm them
China does though, so your argument falls short
As long as humans are greedy, demand will cause supply
Lmao get Down from your High horse
Let’s not forget that uk (assuming from your username) is the second largest arms trader in the world
But you draw the line at fur
No, our prime minister ordered that all mink farms be turned into cotton candy factories where the mink are free to eat as much as they want
**Read the article, or at the very least the headline, before asking such basic questions
And how hard is that
Gee, almost like your lazy ass asked a stupid question because you clearly didn't read the article
Hope he sanitizes his hand after holding that pole
Sneakers and suit pants
Why is he standing up when there are clearly free seats
Most male top politicians in Denmark also use that uniform
At least domestically
Ministers seem to change shoes
Speaking of shoes i just noticed he's just wearing a pair of New Balance that look exactly like my dad's
I wanna hug the driver of that truck

Lick the coin and find out
I was once friends with a German woman, some years older than me, that told in tears about how scared she'd be, as a girl, that the police would snatch her dad up whenever he wasn't home on time
Must've been horrible living under DDR regime
Hasn't history unfortunately shown that the money meant for the development of East Germany was stolen by West German companies/individuals in a degree that rivals [insert your favourite example of massive corruption]
Interesting how you know the voters better than the voters themselves did
One could even call it arrogant
They say it's about losing sovereignty and being controlled by laws and (to-some-extent) unelected bureaucrats, yet you know better than to take people for what they say at face value and instead contribute negative attributes to the British people in general
But I guess just like a thief thinks everyone steals, so do a Xenophobe think everyone else is a xenophobe
These things so often come down to projection
Because nipples are dangerous, can’t have kids see them /s
there is just too much shit on the internet for erdogan to keep up with, some things are boundt to slip
For Denmark, roughly 70 % of the renewable power generation is wind and solar
The 30 % is biomass, biogas and waste incineration
Fuck you, Polan
Poland get a damned grip
Look at that sexy Denmark graph
Now that's rapid improvement
Edit: Props to Lithuania for an equally crazy graph
The waste incineration is not counted as renewable
Unfortunately
Even if the power comes from coal, carbon emmissions are still lower because EV cars are more energy efficient
Plus EV cars don't pollute the cities
Really
I thought the seas around Ireland were way too deep
There is of course floating turbines in development but they are still an expensive option
Isn't land wind much more feasible in Ireland
Denmark has the advantage that most of the seas are shallow
Wel
your hands might not be dirty but your pockets quite so:
*No
1 export) Mineral fuels including oil: US$76
5 billion (62
2% of total exports)*
Just join the EU already
I feel like Norway is cheating
Hydro was built because it was a nobrainer cheap source and now Norwegians can virtue signal about how green they are without having invested like the rest of us
Then it gets a bit complex
What would you do with straw, biodegradable waste and biogas
It emits carbon but would have emitted that carbon too if it was spread out in the manure
That accounts for roughly 10 % of the Danish renewable power generation
How is it like in Switzerland
I understood it that Switzerland imports energy from neighboring countries during their nightly off-peak hours for their hydro-storage
Which not complaining, is a great way to minimize electricity waste
Yes
I only counted biodegradable waste which does count as renewable
It has around the same share as non biodegradable waste in electricity production
It goes:
* Solar: 3,4 %
* Wind: 67 %
* Straw: 2,7 %
* Wood (mostly imported): 19,2 %
* Biodegradable waste: 4 %
* Biogas: 3,1 %
edit: non renewables (the ~30%):
* Oil: 3,1 %
* Natural gas: 21%
* Coal: 68,1 %
* Waste: 7,9 %
Figures from 2017
Yes, they have very strict emmissions regulations
In Copenhagen, they are installing an artificial ski slope on the newest one, so you obviously can't emit toxic exhaust gas there
Yeah, [those are Swedish actually]
Replacing natural gas with coal is not exactly the way forward
You do realise that Denmark has an incredibly high share of renewable, and it was done in the span of only a couple of decades from nearly nothing to 70%.
Demmark is flat as hell, so that excuse does not work for the Netherlands, as Denmark has proven that it's still possible regardless
It's harder, but it's not impossible
Yes it does, my bad
Well there are on the Danish side as well but the Øresund link is under water when driving past that so what are you gonna do
Sure there are losses in the battery, but engine losses in a ICE is around 60 %. All that heat just gets wasted
In the Netherlands, I'm sure there are district heating systems associated with coal plants
Transmission losses are small, maybe around 2-3 %. You need a lot more energy to transport fuel around in trucks than you loose energy in a high voltage cable
> That being said I'm all for EVs regardless of where the energy comes from right now
If there is no demand for more electric energy and less liquid fossil fuels then there is less demand to invest more into EVs which means there is less demand for less liquid fossil fuels etc pp
That chicken and egg problem can only be solved by attacking it from both sides
I agree
> while mineral fuel exports are the fastest growing export in Denmark
Is it really
Our North Sea oil and gas production is going down rapidly
From almost 25 million cubic meters in 2005 to below 10 today
I don't think you would need to share the oil fund
You would just need to contribute relative to your GNI
Yes
But the infographic is about EU countries
If there were one on Mediterranean countries would you demand Finland to be included too
But this graph doesn't count power imported from other countries, only power generated
So what we import is irrelevant
It's true that interconnections with Norway and Sweden will be important in the years to come when we face out some of the thermal plants
But it's not a problem reaching ~50% wind without hydro
The reason we import from Norway is the price
It's often cheaper than what our gas and biomass plants can deliver, especially during the summer
That makes 0 logical sense
Denmark has no mountains and gets almost no power from hydro, we rely heavily on wind and sun
We are jealous of Norway’s mountains
In Denmark we have the problem that windmills produce a lot of power during the night which we don’t use so we sell it very cheap to Norway who use that power to pump water up which they later sell to Denmark at normal price
This
Otherwise Denmark would also show some reliance on the nuclear we import from Sweden
Energinet (the company in charge of the electrical grid) have a nice live display of how the grid looks
Right now we are importing 1000 MW (roughly 25%), but that is basically because of the price
It is cheeper the buy hydro and nuclear than producing it with gas or coal
But
Norway is in the European Economic Area, meaning you have to follow the laws that the EU enforces
AFAIK it's mainly the fishing policies and the insane membership fee because of your high GNP per capita that makes you not wish to join
The subsidiary price for the windmills and solar cells for the 269 MW that was planed in 2018 had an avarage of 10% of electricity price
With the windmills being the lowest subsidiaries
Op,have you seen people in Denmark
*Notices Sweden has a slighter darker shade*
Swedes are all just a bunch of fatties, who could learn a thing or two from the fit Danish Chads
Yes, these statistics were made by OP looking at people
Wdym
People are hella fat in Denmark
Apparantly most other european countries are fatter
Danes are fatter than most of these nations that are in orange
And you base that on what
Seeing fat where you live
Just overall
Why do we have 80-year-olds in politics
It's so absurd to me
It's even worse in the USA when you see senators with canes
Jesus Christ
Earn 29
1% more money, HAH
Spend 67
22% more money on healthcare, oh
All that shit about Denmark during the presidential campaign is over
We Danes can finally relax and let Sweden deal with the hassle of explaining the difference between - I may have heard it from somewhere, so it must be the truth - and plain old verifiable facts
Enjoy Sweden
9 out of 10 times you are wasting your time
They are not listening to reason
Denmark is also pretty extreme tbh
The site isn't drawing correct data from some of its sources
It claims to be sourcing GDP per capita data from the CIA factbook, but a closer examination shows that the data is either a decade out of date or gotten elsewhere, none of the recent data sheets on CIA factbook show the same data as what this site is showing
Does this also count the black and hispanic communities in the US
Homeless people don't use a lot of electricity
Thats calculated on the total spending on health care actually both from the state and private people, so much for paying for healthcare through taxes being more expensive
> electricity
Norway has, essentially, free electricity from massive dams
Accordingly, they use it for a lot of things where others might use gasoline or diesel
I did the same (also in Denmark)
But for rich countries the demand for energy is pretty much inelastic (demand doesn't really react to changes in price)
I earn enough money not to care
I'd rather be warm and pay whatever that costs
I'm from Florida, so I keep all my radiators on max :P
I think what will make an impact is once the distributor can send pricing signals to the home and appliances can respond accordingly (start washing clothes or charging electric car at night when price is lowest)
I'm pretty sure you also have a specific shortage of doctors, at least from anecdotal evidence
I know a bunch of people who have come out of med school, went to Norway for a year or two and come back with what can almost buy a house
This is what would happen if the architects if the rebuild are all american lol
If you really want to increase the amount of church goers in the world this is a decent option
I’m scared
I suppose if history books are given the same value as whatever someone writes online, because it is "just something someone wrote" it is quite scarily easy to believe that this is happening
How
IT'S NOT NORMAL
Walking 2 km in business clothes and shoes is not fun
Can we please have our clouds and 15 degress back
Sooo warm
At 7am
when I walked to the bus it was 15c...
Currently sitting naked with all windows open, because there is no wind, so the warmth isn't being pushed out
Good
Keep it up swede
It's hot and uncommon for a country located 1/3 into the Arctic Circle
There's cold parts of the planet too, you know
Another contender
This bridge goes between Norway and Sweden at Morokulien:
Danish banknotes all feature bridges on them :)
Ironically, the entire thing is located just on the Hungarian side of the border
Why aren't they slav squatting
Fucking disgusting
Working on my knees with kneepads is uncomfortable, can't imagine doing it a whole day
Germans seems to be quite sensible people
It's almost as if they trust people close to them more
Yeah - I was applauding the german common sense ;-) Now at least
(Sure been a busy century for you guys
Like in most dictatorships it was probably driven by internal politics
Ironically - Dictators have to try and keep their internal popularity up
I say we invade America and install a puppet regime
Fuck up free speech
How is free speech fucked up
Article 17 - Right to property
Everyone has the right to own, use, dispose of and bequeath his or her lawfully acquired possessions
No one may be deprived of his or her possessions, except in the public interest and in the cases and under the conditions provided for by law, subject to fair compensation being paid in good time for their loss
The use of property may be regulated by law in so far as is necessary for the general interest
Intellectual property shall be protected
Can you explain what you mean by "free speech is fucked up"? So far you haven't explained what you mean
It's like many of these big companies will go to any length to not have to pay taxes and to ignore regulations
And yet, when they're fined, there's still a bunch of people who are more than happy to defend these assholes
Pay your taxes and follow the rules
It's disgoosting
And they went "m'kay, the fines are still lower than the taxes we never paid
Sad to see her take a step back from national politics, but she is really having an impact where she is now
Margrethe is my gal
Super proud of her - she's done such an amazing job in the commission
She was the leader of my political party, before she became a commissioner
She's insanely competent, she's an incredibly nice woman in person, and I obviously agree with her on most issues
Not to mention that they only get fined for the tax evasion that gets caught
Well, I do vote Radical Left in the elections
Though with the upcoming election I'll have to refamiliarize myself with their current political stance
Just a heads up, we're known as the Danish Social Liberal Party, in English
"Radical Left" is pretty misleading, when you're not familiar with the particular historical meaning it has here
B are more to the left than A these days ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
Edit: changed S to A. My bad
Really
I didn't know that
I don't really mind
I've never been overly sympathetic with A.
The Letters is a way to make counting votes easier if parties have similar sounding names its, counting is faster when votes go to A and B than when they go to Socialdemokratiet and Radikale Venstre
It also makes party focused election election posters much easier as you just put your Letter in you party colors on it and basically everyone knows who its for
Me neither
Claims to have some decent values but their policies don't hold up at all
I'll take them any day over the alternative though (DF and Liberal Alliance as a part of the government *shudders*)
Agreed
Very interesting&mdash;this reminds me of a similar pond known as Devils Hole located in Death Valley
> Devils Hole is a window into this vast aquifer and an unusual indicator of seismic activity around the world
Large earthquakes as far away as Japan, Indonesia and Chile have caused the water to 'slosh' in Devils Hole like water in a bathtub
Waves may spash as high as two meters up the walls [...]
Here's a link to the YouTube video that shows how earthquakes happening at remote locations can cause slushing of the water:
What's scary is that the Devils Hole is more than 150m deep and the bottom has never been mapped
And it has also taken the life of a diver, who went in under the darkness of the night in 1965, only to never emerge (only his diving goggles were ever found):
In pissed denmark is gone
But happy we got skåne back
I think most of my fellow Danes are perfectly fine with ignoring, and being ignored by, the outside world
As a Dane I am enraged beyond belief
as a dane i am offend that germany owns holstein
Else then that it looks better than ever
Maybe not calling norwegians after a traitor to humanity
Really had to do is Danes like that, huh
Denmark is just gone
I am deeply triggered
I accept losing almost our entire land mass just to spite the Swedish by taking Skåne back
F u regards Denmark
You've succeeded
I really don't want Malmø.
I have to agree
I looked at this map and thought it had to have been made by a swede
But there's a lot of clever details and a good sense of humour, so that idea seems quite impossible
I feel that lol
When swedes and norwegians insult danish people, they call them "danish devil".
When danish people insult norwegian people, they call them "mountain monkey"
When danish people insult swedish people, they call them "swede".
There's literally no word that is a worse insult for swedish people than "swede". I see nothing wrong with the map
Stop threatening to return Skåne to us, and just do it you pussies
Either that or admit you secretly love Skåne and wish all of Sweden could be like it
I feel its a terrible deal
The only thing better than cheap beer is free beer
And Denmark :)
Well, we're quite good with submarines in Denmark, lots of
enthusiasts
I say Denmark prepared for climate change and went full Atlantis
Everybody in Scandinavia adores Finland
You drink booze, freeze your ass of and eat shitty food like the rest of us in Scandinavia - and you fought the Russians like men
You got to respect that
Well, Denmark also worked willingly with the Nazis
at least until 1943, when our grand coalition government stepped down because they refused to introduce the death penalty
As a Dane, I’d say that’s fair :-)
Funny enough, we Danes also always joke about Skåne (and Halland, and Blekinge) being a part of Denmark
Yeah, i noticed after my post that Skåne in Sweden was marked as Denmark
That's likely to be a slight against the swedes than Danes
Or both perhaps
For some map makers Denmark seems to be this small detail on top of Germany that you can just skip for, I don't know, artistic reasons
Or space reasons
I assume it's the same people who skip Malta and Iceland
Hva' siger hun, hende der

Making a campfire is fun, burning a pile of rubber tires is just stupid
I think it's more a matter of blowing out pointless greenhouse gasses rather than fuel shortage
**Edit (a bit long, sorry):** Wow, this really upset some of you
I just want to add some more nuance to my comment
First of all, I was just pointing out that I think the first comment was talking about climate change rather than fuel shortage
I'm personally not bothered by this particular flight exhibition, but if there was a vote to do it or not, I would probably vote don't.
A lot of you are commenting "one flight wont change anything" and while that is technically true, it's also false in the long run
I think it's good to be mindful of stuff like this
Sure, substituting your ground beef for beans isn't singlehandedly saving the world, but we all need to work together to be able to send a message where it really has a meaning
Think of it as the butterfly effect: maybe your bean bolognese you serve for your friends is so awesome you inspire them to try experimenting with veggies themselves
More people reduce their meat consumption and now the beef industry needs to find a new product, so they start making veggie burgers instead
"*That's ridiculous
"* you might think, but it's actually happening in Denmark currently: Danish Crown (largest meat company in the country) launched a meat-veggie hybrid in 2019, and Arla (largest dairy company in northen europe) launched an oat milk last year
Pretty sure we can strike a balance and this is way off to the pointless side of that golden mean

My Serbian family who lives in small villages thinks the EU is devil incarnate
It’s absolutely shocking how much the EU is despised
I’m legit laughed at when I say I’m Pro-EU
I think because they're a candidate for EU membership
It should eventually pay off, given how much faster eastern European economies are growing, compared to ours
That was the idea, at least
The problem however, is corruption and the fact that Serbia isn't a functional democracy even now when we have the tools to discipline them
I'm afraid what they'll be like if we admit them to the Union and lose all control over them
Hungary or Bulgaria will probably be beacons of human rights and fiscal discipline compared to Serbia
Basically, we should go back to each country complying with the Copenhagen agreement criteria before they're given a single penny
Especially if we're talking about western Balkans which is collectively worthless
Freedom House says Serbia isn't a functional democracy and the corruption index puts it off the charts
Sorry if the facts trigger you
Don't listen to all that Russian and Chinese propaganda
That area used to be working class and the bars lining the canal were filled with sailors and prostitutes
Today it is a highly gentrified tourist trap
Ive been to copenhagen, but never in this part
damn
If you like copenhagen
You should try and take a look at South Funen
It's filled with small islands and lots of beatiful nature
Most of the cities are old trading/fishing cities
Copenhagen is definitely my favorite place I've ever been or lived and I miss it so so much
"You're not helping
" is exactly what I thought when I saw this post haha
Thanks for visiting
Come back soon
Copenhagener here
I agree Copenhagen is beautiful but this is a photo of the classic tourist trap Nyhavn
It blows my mind that if you google Copenhagen, you will just get 500 images of that street
[This] and [this] is what local Copenhagen actually looks like
I bike through there every day to work
Have often had to stop and take photos when the light or the life there is particularly special
As a former resident: Yes they do
You travel the world and rarely find places you would rather live
Notice “live” not just visit
There are plenty of places that are more exciting, but Copenhagen is just and incredible city to live in
I live just outside Copenhagen
It’s not that inhabitants of cities like this doesn’t know the beauty of the city
But the nice parts of a city, at least in the case of Copenhagen, are just mainly tourist areas and horrible expensive
Therefore locals rarely visit, and as you see more areas of the city, you realize there are far more ugly areas than nice like the area displayed in the picture
Therefore it gets harder to acknowledge the beautifulness of a city, because you are basically never there
That’s at least how I feel about it
This area is called “ny havn” (pronounced nu hawn, means new harbor) I pass by it everyday on my bike going to work
There’re always tourists in the area wanting to ride a tour boat, eating at the restaurants (colored buildings, top of them is residential), or famous people making commercials
Last month I accidentally passed by Mads Mikkelsen (the guy that whipped James Bond’s balls in Casino Royal) shooting a commercial
I was inches away from him on my bike path
In Denmark we have a modest culture so we see famous people as normal & respected humans as us
Specially if they’re Nordic
We really do
I don't live in the center but it takes me 20 minutes on a bike to get there
At any rate I love Copenhagen, weather and all
Every year (except for this crazy 2020
) when I go to the Mediterranean over summer, I find myself missing my city after a couple of weeks
> Copenhagen's landmarks
Christania is probably the second most visited place after Tivoli
Countries in the EU can veto alot of decisions, Denmark is often the “let’s rethink this shit guys
” Person at the party
Yes and no, we don’t really have mutch influence, but whenever we do somthing we scream out what we did
But we are pretty far along when looking at the green energy and social help stuff
Very true
Not very low temperatures but high humidity and windy af
Rivers in Denmark
Not according to any geography book published in Denmark in forever
No mountains, so no real seasonal fluctuations in waterlevels from melting snow, and the streams that do exist are too shallow to allow ocean going vessels under power to navigate them
So a river in Denmark is considered a larger body of water than exists in this land where no point is further away from the ocean than 50 kilometers
What we have is an å (stream, creek), but we do not have a flod (river)
Rivers
In Denmark
HAH
At most, historically, Denmark has had a lot of inlets
Like with Trelleborg near Slagelse, back in the day when the sea level was a bit higher
Nah, strøget
Very few Danes come to Nyhavn for Nyhavn
Most Danes are passing through or just sitting at the canal
I don't know any Danes who would eat there
Kinda depends on the neighborhood
I live in a concrete block surrounded by other concrete blocks
Quite drab and dreary
Never in my life could I afford the pictures neighborhood
Fårup Sommerland
It's not a landmark in Copenhagen
Don't beat yourself up, Fårup Sommerland is awesome too
Fond memories going there as a kid
Good luck this summer, then
We don't hate Norway, Only Sweden
Everybody here loves Norway
We adore our little mountain monkeys
I love all my Scandi brethren <3
To be fair Sweden has really nice neighbours
We don't hate Norway
Only Sweden
I didn't know I was supposed to hate Norway
Nice try, but we all just hate sweden
Danes do not hate Norwegians
Denmark and Sweden both love Norway more or less, it's actually one of the things in the world we can actually agree on
^^^Finland ^^^is ^^^not ^^^Scandinavia
Norway and Denmark are united in hating sweeden
Idk what this is, but it's very wrong
**Norway:** The hot (and rich) chick that both Denmark and Sweden wants to date
**Denmark:** Norway's ex
Has been in many fights with Sweden
**Sweden:** Norway's old friend
Has been in many fights with Denmark
**Finland:** Their quiet, mutual friend
Not really a part of the gang, but occasionally just follows along
With their powers combined, they become **/r/Navia**!
Just to be clear the "hate" here is mostly a running joke
It's more like playful teasing between the countries, while in reality we are very close (not just geographically)
Most people here probably understand that, but I just wanted to make that clear since there are places in the world where neighboring countries legitimately hate each other
As A dane, i Can confirm
Maybe
Denmark and Norway likes each other, but dislike Sweden
Nobody dislikes Denmark, but both Norwegians and Swedes think the danish language is gibberish
Norway and Denmark are both Denmark
Umm
I don't know any Danes who hate Norway
What is this
I can confirm
&#x200B;
\-Zach, Aarhus, Denmark
This is false
I have not ever heard a dane speak ill of Norwegians
Might single out the occasional loony, but mostly we just want to fuck, swim, get drunk and play football with them, in my experience
nono Danes likes Finns, tolerate Norwegians and doesn't like the Swedes
Yeah, Dane here - we don't hate Norway and we just pity the beautiful country of Sweden for being so full of swedes
The only thing wrong with Sweden is that it's full of swedes
Also, they banned fun in the 60's.
Excuse you
1: I can't speak for Norway or Sweden, but in Denmark you start your English education fairly early on
I was 10 years old when I started to receive English lessons in school, but that was in the 80'es
My eldest daughter who's 7 have a few English lessons each week
2: We get a lot of English spoken popculture via TV and other media, and unlike many other European countries that have voice actors dub the original English voices, we almost exclusively use subtitles
So you sit there and watch The Terminator and Arnold says: "I'll be back
" and then you immediately read that this means "Jeg kommer igen senere
Honestly, English teachers in Denmark have the easiest job in the world :)
Mind you, I'm not slamming the other countries for dubbing
I learned to speak acceptable german by watching Sesam Straße, not Sesame Street
If a Dane with really low intelligence moved from Denmark to Sweden, the average IQ would rise in both countries
I resent this (but pretty much)
They also have far and away the best neighbors
Don't know about kebab, but we win the falafel race:

There's also a bear at the castle
Here's a pic I took of it two years ago:
I know this will sound odd, because I was a tourist myself when I was in Cesky Krumlov, but the fucking Chinese tourists were ruining that town for me
They were generally just so rude, loud and obnoxious
The fact that they also arrive in groups of like 20-30 doesn't exactly help the case
No manners whatsoever
At least that was my experience ...
We also went to Brno on that same vacation
Entirely different experience
So few tourists but still an awesome city
As a Dane, I can only say ...
Typical Swedes

Serbia was ethnically cleansing its population, someone needed to do something
Don't make Serbia out to be some kind of innocent victim here
NATO expanded because the countries that were finally free of the Soviet yoke wanted to join, so that they wouldn't once more be put under Russia's thumb as soon as Russia stabilized again
Instead of asking what foreign policies Russia enacted in the 90s how about looking at the foreign policies of the USSR throughout the 20th century
Eastern Europe (apart from Yugoslavia, because Tito wasn't having it, and he was a hard motherfucker) was de facto occupied by them for a long time
Some since 1917, some since 1945, but none of them wanted any part of it
They just didn't have a choice until the 1990s.
> Where did I do that
After you answer that, tell me which NATO country Serbia attacked so that a defensive organisation had to fight back
Don't pretend you didn't imply it
And none, but who *should* have intervened then, if not NATO
The UN
Yes that would have been better, but they couldn't because of Security Council vetos from, guess who
Russia and China
>WWI and WWII showed which post war actions will lead your enemy to become your friend and which will lead them to become aggressive in 30 years
Indeed, occupying Eastern Europe did not win Russia any friends there
Except Serbia, because they never experienced the reality of it
WW1 showed that demanding gigantic reparations and bankrupting the losing side was a very bad idea
WW2 showed that financial assistance and democracy was a good idea (Marshall plan) and that gobbling up sovereign nations and enforcing your ideology on them (what the USSR did) was a bad one in the long term
Entirely different situations
Russia wasn't occupied nor a bombed out shell and didn't want/need the West to interfere with their internal affairs
Stop acting like they were the victims here
Re: "tangents" if you're too dense to  see the connection that's on you
Dane here, I've never heard anyone actually SAY the "hit". It's just "to fluer med eet smæk".

When I visited Amsterdam I was impressed by how pedestrian/bicycle friendly the city was
Even the area I stayed in which was far from the centre (IJBurg) was well planned and thought out for pedestrians/cyclists
Also the tram system is great
How did Amsterdam become like this
People just got fed up with all the cars and decided to try and change it
Same thing happened with "Strøget" here in Copenhagen, in the early 1960's it was still a regular street (for cars), but now it is a 1
1 km long pedestrian street (and tourist attraction, for some reason)
It’s gradually growing year by year too, as connecting roads are traffic sanitized as it’s called, when cars and parking spaces are deprioritized
By giving less space or no space, and improving the sidewalks and bike paths
Why is it always swedes having dumbass opinions
Live a year in Copenhagen or Amsterdam and you’ll understand
So effing cool

My great-grandmother was named after one of your islands

"HAS THE E.U. MOLESTED YOUR CHILDREN
Gosh this thing is making me laugh more than I probably should
They had a lot of exemptions which they would not get back, so they probably don't want to return
Rona
Her father, my great-great-grandfather, was a ship captain
He was passing by the island when he received news of the birth of his daugther, so he decided she should be named after it (I imagine more thought went into it, but it was a long time ago, so the story is pretty barebones)
I barely knew her, she died when I was only a kid, but my mom told me she had a heart gold
All I ever knew of her was that she yelled at me when I ran in the hallways or jumped in the bed
HAS DUMBING DOWN THE UK MADE YOUR PENSION IMPOTENT
Thank you
I have plenty of those, from both my mother's and my father's side (Rona is on my father's)
This one time, my great-great-grandfather, Rona's father, had stopped at a Norwegian dock to stock up on lard
Problem was, they used different units of measurement and couldn't agree on what a pound was, so to resolve their differences, they drove a fat, naked hag atop a hill of lard, and pushed her down
Then they scooped out whatever lard was caught between her cheeks and determined that to be a pound
The phrase of legend is that when they asked "What in hell should we do with this butt-lard
", he said "We'll use it for [klejner] a disgusting fat-based christmas cookie
It probably isn't true, but it's a good story
Another good story, which definitely is true, is that my great-great-whateversomething-grandfather on my mother's side, who had a castle in Normandy and hunted with a legitimate wolf-dog, had his entire face bitten off by said wolf-dog
His servants could only identify him by his clothes when they found the body
That's not even a story passed down to me, it's a local legend in the french village where it happened
Sorry for oversharing, it's just hard not to
My grandfather spent his life mapping out his ancestry, and my mom has followed suit
She was the one who discovered the wolf story by trespassing on a farmer's land while checking out the old castle ruins (the french revolution wasn't kind to them)
Luckily, the farmer was eager to share in his culture
In that case I'll top it off
The wolf-dog castle family originally came from Norway and invaded Normandy alongside [Rollo the Viking] who they shared a grandfather with (they were descendents of Rollo's father's brother)
As a result, they were granted a fiefdom, the castle at Sainte-Opportune-la-Mare
When William the Conqueror, Rollo's descendent, fought the English at the Battle of Hastings, 3 of my ancestors were present, one of whom shares my name
Then, when the french revolution was nigh, the family married into a danish military officer's family, my family, because they confused them for a Norwegian noble family of the same name
The other half of the family moved to southern Italy, where my wife happens to be from
Another of my ancestors was known as the "peasant tormentor" because he flogged a servant to death after catching him stealing
He was later executed, but hey, that's what you get for flogging your employees
I have practically endless family stories, as incredible as they are uncredible, but most of them have actual sources
For example, my mom found our old knight's crest at William the Conqueror's castle, so we know for a fact they served him as knights at the Battle of Hastings
She found the same crest at the ruins she explored while trespassing the french farmer's land

I started watching for the historical fashion, but the arc about Churchill's portrait was amazing
I also really like that they include all the racially tone-deaf speeches of the times
Like when Elizabeth holds speeches in the colonies
It's wild to listen to, and only fair that they include it
Yeah, the way you mentioned Charles is how I think of the Churchill episodes - Churchill was obviously the villain politically, and he's portrayed as a stubborn old oaf, but we see him come to the realisation about the >!glimmer in the pond being about his grief for his dead daughter
< I thought it was beautiful to show that complexity in an otherwise unlikeable character, and the actor did amazing
With racism, I'd much rather have it shown how it was at the times
But there would probably be pearl-clutching, because surely you can't portray a character with such views and not have them be a one-dimensional villain
And if it's in a fictional setting, it can be used to imply things about the author, *even if it's misunderstood* and based on faulty analysis
It takes writing effort to make it nuanced, and it's difficult to gauge how much the audience need to be told who to sympathise with
If the show is Morally Infallible Protagonist vs
Pure Evil Antagonist, of course they'll only be able to show racism in the antagonist, regardless of historical/cultural setting
It helps that the crown is based around real events, there are records of the speeches and such
Though I do think they glorify Elizabeth a bit, everyone comes across as complex and flawed people
Because they're not shown as morally infallible, it makes sense that they'd follow the views of the times
I'm not familiar with the particular atrocity you mentioned, but I don't doubt the royals have lots of dirty secrets, and anything coming to light publicly would be swiftly swept under the rug
But I think the producers had to draw a line, it's a drama, not an exposé. So they stuck to public records, and if there was a public scandal, they would show the characters reacting to the scandal - but only if they thought it would provide a good framework for interesting dramatisation
I imagine the writers focus on events that give them the opportunity to show the character developments and interactions they want
Historical events and objective truth are excellent for the suspension of disbelief, but it's not really ever what it's about
Something as serious as child sex abuse deserves more than to be a side note, used for a bit of drama before the story moves on
The victims deserve that publicity supports them, rather than just stick to what the newspapers wrote at the times
So I understand the decision, it seems a bit like a "damned if you do, damned if you don't" situation
At least from an outside perspective, I have no professional insight into screenwriting specifically
I get the idea, and it’s good
But this is just too unreal
If this is to prove a point, the critics will just use it to portray how unrealistic the European unionists are
With that said, I like the thought tho
Just some size adjustments would do the trick;)
One for all, All for One
I've just googled OECD and 2060, I can't find the report you're referring to
Most of the reports seems to suggest that the economy is going to level out more, but I'm curious to see where you have those numbers from
I would say more like the UK of Asia
Loves tea, imperialism, has a royalty
Thanks, 2012 seems old, but looking at it again I can't see they've updated that exact report
The only numbers I can find that are newer is on their data site, but they are from 2014
Here they say that the World's GDP will be 267,676,800 million USD
For the countries mentioned above
China: $62,591,470 million (23,4%)
India: $56,348,490 million (21,1%)
The US: $38,974,320 million (14,6%)
The Euro Area (EU16): $26,143,340 million (9,8%)
Japan: $7,887,404 million (2,9%)
So maybe slightly more "optimistic" than the 2012 numbers
One thing is for certain all countries mentioned is expected to grow, some are just expected to grow faster

My least favorite parts of Denmark and other European cities is when you leave the city center, and drive through ugly suburbs filled with yellow brick houses and flat roofs from the 70's, and then enter the outskirts of the cities where a ton of car dealerships have enormous empty lawns in front of them, and they're just wasting space
The only places I've been so far where this isn't common was Oslo and Cannes
Oslo is essentially on the side of a mountain, in a bay
So driving to the outskirts of the city you go through tunnels blown right out of the cliff, and drive through pine forests
In Cannes, you're driving by the coastline, under palm trees
Also with a cliff face to your side
So it's just so much more scenic
That's disappointing

Edit: Or maybe they usually spray it with RoundUp or whatever
I actually agree, I like the "touch of green" you sometimes see on cobblestone plazas, streets or whatever
It gives the place a more cozy and "natural" look to me
It doesn't look as "manicured". :)
Wanting the good without having the bad, eh
Cant get presents if you don't behave ;)
I wish old people didn't get to vote for something that wont affect them
Because you took one of the most retarded decisions in the history of your country
You even allowed that decisions to be taken by people with very limited knowledge about the consequences
I wonder if the British know that when they're acting like this, they're making Theresa May seem like she the most sane and realistic that they have to offer
They can make of that what they like
What are those "red lines" people are talking about
Well it's not like it's much work to say "Remember the billion times we said that XYZ are non-negotiable
Yeah those still apply
" when May comes back thinking she for some unknown reason has new leverage
I dont know what is wrong with that government
Literally run by children at this point
I mean how can you do this
You are giving a speech and you have people behind you cheering your or booing at you
Then you have people playing on their ipads
You dont have enough seats
You vote by shouting
Wtf
2019 people
Shouting over someone is not a valid way of voting even the Greeks knew that and that's why they did it with colored stones ages ago
It is pathetic
to say the least
You sure it wasn't always run by children
Every time I watch some news from the British parliment (House of commons
) it always looks like a bunch of kids yelling, laughing and generally being unprofessional
Well many European countries export a lot of goods to the UK (e.g. cars for Germany or pork for Denmark) who would of course prefer that no tariffs are imposed to make their products more expensive and thus noncompetitive in the UK market
But that's always rather heavily been outweighed by the EU not wanting to accept the UK idea that they can leave the EU while still retaining the benefits of membership (namely free-trade with the massive EU market)
The Germans will have to sell their cars elsewhere and we'll have to sell our pork elsewhere
The UK government has essentially been saying they could leave but retain all the benefits, like you could get a divorce and expect to keep fucking your former spouse
They've pointed to e.g. Norway who have free trade with the EU despite not being a member, while overlooking that Norway is effectively paying membership dues to get that access, and they submit to tons of EU regulations without getting to vote on it to make that happen
Neither of which the UK think they'd have to do
But no May never had any real leverage
If the UK was given a favorable deal of getting to not follow the same rules/regulations as the rest of the EU, while still enjoying the benefits (and thus gaining an unfair advantage effectively)
Then nearly every other country with sizable EU-skeptic blocs would be clamoring to leave on the same terms and it would be the death of the union
And in the end, the UK will likely lose far more on loss of exports to the entire EU than any single EU country will lose on exports to the UK
To me, as another outsider
It seems a symptom of the fact that big chunks of UK media has essentially been using the EU as a scapegoat for every problem imaginable for decades now (while never giving the EU credit for all positive regulations and whatever else that actually improve people's lives)
So there's a whole lot of resentment towards the EU if you only get your news from e.g. the Daily Mail
And politicians have played into it because it's an easy way to score points to say "Yeah, we'll take back control from those out of touch elites down in Brussels
" Basically very populist/nationalist pandering
Like May was at one point declaring that it was a great victory that the UK could now have their passport be whatever colour they want it to be
While the EU responded "That was always the case, the burgundy-red colour passport colour has always simply been a recommendation, not a requirement".
And then to some extent the UK as a whole just seems a bit lost in the past where it was a great power and an empire that could dictate world affairs
Mind you're they're still leaps and bounds more powerful than say Denmark where I'm from
But not compared to the whole EU
And the way that the EU works, in some matters it requires all member countries (no matter how small) to agree to a deal
Which is why we're seeing a relatively small country such as Ireland being able to impose it's will in saying no deal if it includes a hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland (though to some extent a lot of EU countries are supportive of that point, because no one wants to see a revival of the Troubles)
Another silly thing is this UK dream that they can be free of EU regulations and mandate their own with new trade agreements now
[The EU is so big that for most companies it's cheaper to just make all their products compliant with EU standards/regulations than to make separate versions] So the reality is that when the UK makes a trade deal with say New Zealand, then the goods they'll be importing will still be following EU regulations, regulations that the UK now will no longer have any say on
How’s everything so green where you are
He is going to cook himself
It's interesting how different the ages are, I am from Denmark and when I moved out at the age of 21, I was already getting reactions from people about being kind of a loser for living at home at that age
Could be a BNP map
There seems to be a divide between protestants and catholics in this thread which mest have spilt over to America
At least as a Dane Incan confirm that I was expected to pay rent and take care of myself from 18
Where are those numbers from
None of my Danish friends where still living with their parents at 21
At least in Portugal, the process of changing your official home address on your citizen card is quite bothersome and there are usually no legal penalties if you don't do it (as far as I remember), so most people don't even bother
I moved out of my parents' at 18 (never moved back in) and only changed my official address when I was 25 or so, so for all purposes I was still living with my parents
Now I live in Denmark and the process of updating your address is not only much easier, but you also get fined if you don't report a change of address, so everyone does it
Money/unemployment naturally plays a big part, but there's more to it than that
In my case I moved out when I was 19 and didn't have a job since I turned 18
Unis are free and we get €800 a month for not living with our parents while studying, which is enough to pay for student accommodation and all other nessecities throughout the month
I think it also have changed over time
I am old for reddit and live in Nordjylland
When I moved out at 18 it was kind of expected
My oldest sibling is 7 years younger and she moved out when she was around 21 and that seemed late
My youngest brother who is 15 years younger than me stayed home until he started at university and had to move
Some of it might be cultural too
I have greek friends who are financially independent (could rent a flat or even buy a house) but are expected to live with their family until he marries and starts his own
Dunno how common that is though
It almost making me feel bad that I in Denmark currently earn more than 1200€ a month working a part time job 10-20 hrs
a week, while attending high school
This is not even counting in the free money I get from the government on the side
Damn that is skewed
> I would imagine culture is also partly a result of government policy
Yeah that must be true
I suspect institutions and government policy shape each other in complicated ways
For example, culture might shape the electorate's wishes --> elected politicians --> government policy, which in turn might shape the electorate again
Clearly not for some of them
Maybe they are the exception though, I don’t know
So you believe it's mostly about the economics of housing

I hope so

I have visited Italy a lot of times - but there is always so much more to see ;-) (From Denmark)
Just wondering if I dare start booking for this summer - or if Europe will still be more or less closed
He ;)
Yeah, fingers crossed - getting real tired of this shiet
This would be like a dream coming true
Look at that distance to Sweden :,)
We're moving to Ireland
I could get used to that
Sweden is pleasantly far away too
That's an extra bonus
Because historical linguists have had it too easy for too long
Iceland was damn hard to find
yay Ireland
lovely place
That German/Russian border makes me kinda nervous
I can dig that
I have to say, in terms of drinking behavior and intelligeble language, Ireland is actually a pretty good fit for Denmark
As a dane with Irish ancestry I'm absolutely fine with this
The Kingdom of Denmark is the second largest European country
Spain moves to Germany
It's like the opposite of a normal summer
And we go to a tax haven
Denmark same temperature same amount of rain same ocean view and same size
thats like moving from one apartment to another in the same complex
Only advantage is the annoying neighbor Sweden is gone
Isn't 'the largest country' the same as 'the country with the biggest area'?
At least you two change climate somewhat, we just go from the northern/central European mud pit to the western European mudpit
Likewise
argh, right dad :)
A few years ago I was there via Euroscola and held the opening speech for Denmark
Surreal experience, I was only 16
I also sat right in the inner circle, at seat number 5
The feel of the chamber is crazy, it's as if you have just walked into the oval office
The huge sense of impressiveness and eyes on you almost made me stutter
Waaaay to many primary colors in a far to messy arrangement
Angela Dorothea Merkel fought alongside Elrond, son of Eärendil and Elwing, in the first age
That is truly awesome

Erhm, why is Danish Zealand (Sjælland) yellow in development
They’re closer to the biggest productivity hub in Denmark in regards to Copenhagen, and has several large cities and is probably one of the most well-connected areas in regards to highways and transportation
What are the criterias here
Because from a Danish perspective, that right there makes no sense
Northern, Western and Southern Jutland (Jylland) are a lot “less” developed from in comparison, so I dont really get this map
Edit: Also, can you guys start listing your sources on these maps
It should be standard, but I see tons of maps like these on this subreddit, and rarely does it include reference to a paper or study
Lovely Italy
Almost the entire country is "more developed" and then
# Sjælland
Cyprus is more developed
Always knew something was different about Sjælland
Regional GDP is measured by dividing production with the number of inhabitants
So there is a huge commuter effect
People living in Roskilde or Køge and working in Copenhagen will count to the production in Copenhagen while adding to the denominator in Region Zealand
Second, Region Zealand does have low labour market participation compared to the rest of Denmark
There has been for many years an exodus of people with poor labour market integration from Copenhagen to places with lower cost of living
Plus some towns in region Zealand, like Nakskov, have been hit hard by de-industrialisation
Apparently, the map is based on GDP per capita relative to EU28 averages (75-90% of avg
for status as 'transitioning')
But even using this metric, which really doesn't say anything at all about development, the data is wrong
The lowest average GDP per capita of any municipality in region Sjælland is Lolland Kommune, at 311
000 kr (2019) which is the equivalent of 41
802€ - roughly 117% of EU28 GDP per capita (35
623€)
I think yellow is correct, but the Copenhagen area should be red
Best regards from Jylland
OP linked this: [
As a Jutlander I made a roadtrip in Sjælland, Lolland and Falster minus Copenhagen this summer and I tell you there are a lot of ghosttowns compared to Vestjylland imo
cities like Sorø and Nakskov are really dying cities
Yes
What is going on
Sjælland less developed than Norrland
Gimme a break
That's Sjælland, which we in Jylland usually say is a part of Sweden
A surprise to me
And that's where Novo Nordisk is, one of the more well known Danish companies
Not a lot of action, it's right between the big cities of Odense and Copenhagen drawing most of the action
Novo Nordisk can't carry the whole region, and if Lolland is included, well fuck
At least it's nice and quiet here :)
Yeah, it's just poorly divided regions by the state
They wanted to wall in Copenhagen, and then just made the rest of Sjælland and Lolland the other part
Lolland is a job desert, and because of the rail and highway going through Sjælland between two bigger cities, Odense on Fyn and Copenhagen, it's easier for many to just work in those cities, and then there is the north-western part of Sjælland where Novo Nordisk is, one of the bigger workplaces in the region - but they can't really make up for the rest
Bornholm is not a region though, it's part of the Capital Region
TIL: Romans didn't like Bosnia and Herzegovina
We're a strong independent country, who don't need no Roman
Exactly, Romans were great engineers and could set up a rudimentary camp quickly
But when after the failed attempts to subdue the Germanic tribes more permanent forts were created to store garrisons
I think Hadrian was heavily involved in this, but it might have been sooner

\-Bowsers castle will be in France, near belgium
\-The Chunnel will be 2 pipes-London is a ghost house
Thank you for all of the support
Edit: Bowsers castle will be in Russia, as it is bigger than i thought :P
Love the idea and execution
Amazing :)

That's what i am going for so far
Haha, that would be great
Thanks
I will post updates along the way

lmao /r/rareinsults
too bad many of the monarchies are so close, else it would be cool to have castles in those countries
Is that why you left out most of our Islands
You traitor you
I would, but it is hard when working on such a scale
I have a lot of experience with it, that's why I chose it
Thanks :)
That's kind of my point, the monarchies would be great places to put the castles, especially since there's 7 of them in Europe
The problem i was trying to convey is that many of them are grouped quite closely together
The other one is us
^^right
^^^riiiight
Not a great look really
Yes
until the 14th of April
Edit: It's April 12th
Because UK probably leaves the EU on that date
If they pass a plan they leave May 22nd
If they fail to pass anything they are kicked out on April 12th
Why do people that defend Russia or Drumpf always uses the word muh
Are they cows
The parliament are voting no to everything
I think the only thing they would agree on is if the EU sends them free money every month
It's been 3 years, they have had plenty of time to figure something out, but when they leave there will be chaos, as they have not spent the time preparing
Thanks
They also voted no to staying
I miss Alicante, me and the family take a vacation there every summer

That picture is of one of the main tourist attractions/traps in Denmark - a pedestrian only street in the very heart of Copenhagen with just about any and every shop imaginable, from tacky souvenirs to high-end furriers - taken this Wednesday, the last day before Easter, when shops would usually be closed for 4 of the next 5 days, and judging by the shadows at about 11 am

and well thats why
Why
Shouldn't companies be expected to keep a reserve instead of doling out every bit of profit (and sometimes more than that) to stockholders
Isn't risk an inherent part of buying stock, or have the bailouts of the past decades erased that part of stockholders' memories
If the stockmarket were made to remember that there is no guarantee that poorly run businesses would be bailed out, then perhaps we wouldn't have seen this ballooning wealth disparity we have witnessed over the past 20-35 years
I mean look at a company like Norwegian (the airline)
Somehow they've been allowed to acquire a debt that dwarfs their estimated value at a pace of **60 to 1**.
Fairly certain others have posted it, but to paraphrase that Indian investor: STOP BAILING OUT FAILING COMPANIES
I absolutely agree with states receiving parts or even full businesses in return for aid
No taxpayer bailouts should be free
But businesses keep rejecting this and lobbying against it so it rarely happens
Sweden's handling of Nordea in the aftermath is a rare example, and one that should be copied round the world
In regards to the your middle quote, yes, but that's not what you're arguing
You are arguing for unprofitable and unethical businesses to be saved
If you are living well during the uptimes, you should be able to put something aside for the downturns
Your shareholders' interest shouldn't be your foremost concern
Your company's should
It's not just that Europeans are better off than in Africa
Imperialism just never died off, and we've been actively keeping poor countries poor by using the IMF to instate austerity measures on them while also making deals with corrupt governments that allow our companies far too cheap access to raw materials
If everyone who worked on your iPhone was to be paid a wage that's similar to a skilled factory worker in the USA, the price would only rise by 20 %. That's because part of it is already produced by skilled, high-paid workers in Sout Korea, and only some parts of the assembly is done in places like China
If they were forced to pay those Chinese workers 15 USD an hour, their wage would rise 12-fold, but the cost of producing the iPhone as a whole would only go up by 20 %.
So much good could be done throughout the world if we would just tolerate slightly higher prices on products

America going with the swedish approach
Because states count deaths differently
Fx Italy counted all Corona deaths, even if the patients had chronic  diseases or was ill beforehand with stuff like lung cancer
Where's other only count official deaths if the patient had no other  complications beforehand, which makes numbers look much better on paper
Sod off Sweden, go play with your highest number of deaths per capita in Europe
They are approaching Italy in terms of deaths per capita
Especially with Russia not a part of the EU, and Russia being the European country with the highest population
And even that isn't really that accurate overall
You may get some idea if you simply want to compare countries but it's damn near impossible to get any accurate number for a specific country
The social distancing, washing hands, "lock down" etc
obviously also impacts the spread of things like influenza which is very common around the same time that Covid popped up, so you may not end up with *that* many extra deaths since influenza usually kills people as well
You may also have fewer deaths from traffic related accidents, work related accidents etc
since most people were sitting at home way more than usual
So just because you don't see many "extra deaths" overall doesn't mean that Covid didn't kill a lot of people, it may simply be that we've prevented a lot of "normal" deaths at the same time
However, you may obviously be able to compare countries that way to some degree, if one country has no extra deaths and another country has a lot of them, that could be a useful comparison but you still don't really know how many Covid killed in either country
Another potential issue could be that the usual influenza may not have hit certain countries much at all if they usually get it from cross-border movements
It usually hits in the colder months after all which seems to indicate that it thrives in colder temperatures and thus it may not really impact the warmer countries much at all if no one's able to travel there due to a Covid lock down
So they may have way fewer influenza deaths this year for all we know
The problem is that we're working with a "sample size of one" here since we don't get these virus outbreaks that often
We have nothing remotely recent to really compare it to

Europe: "LISSEN 'ERE YA LIL' SHIT
No, it's not
Some argue that they are, but that makes little sense
Their arguments are somewhat stranded on either "identifying as Europeans", "Armenia had somr ties to The Roman Empire",  or that they are Christian
Nothing of it really makes sense
Identifying as Europeans does not make your country European
Just like Americans identifying as something that their ancestors were does not make them that
Using the Roman Empire as a standard for what is European or not is problematic as best
That would exclude practically all Scandinavian and Centraleuropean countries, while also making places like Tunis European
That doesn't make sense either
Using Christianity would make more sense that the other two as that is what bound Europe into a community in for instance the medieval period
Though that doesn't make whole lot of sense either as it would include different large parts of the world while also excluding places like parts of Bosnia and Albania etc
Europe is usually agreed to be countries North of the Mediterranean, and West of the Bosphorus and blocked off by the Ural mountains in the east
Though it is not middle eastern either, I suppose it would categorised as Asian
Or historical
But they are in Eurovision which is what really counts
Just because you consider yourself European doesnt make you European
Especially considering you're in Transcaucasia
Sorry, not European - culturally, geographically or at all
Attack helicopter etc etc
You can't really use the Roman empire as a standard for what is Europe and what isn't. That would create problems as for instance Denmark wouldn't be Europe, but Tunis would
That makes little sense
>The EU and the UN do, along with a lot of other European people
Not really
The only reason why Europe wants _any_ Transcaucasia nation in the EU is so they A) Don't align with Russia and B) Oil/Gas pipelines
It's all politics and nothing to do with culture
>Sorry, but your personal opinion doesn't really matter here in regards to this so
The same can be said about yours
And I think we both realise that this subreddit has an _extremely_ liberal definition of whats considered "Europe" - I think mostly due to the huge amount of non-Europeans commenting

Stop with the personal attacks
It's nearly half your comments in this thread
Why the fuck would _anybody_ think that I'm a European official, even if I was - this is a _personal_ account
> the transcaucasian state's are considered European due to their historical and cultural presence and whatnot
Haha what
> The view expressed in this server is, by and large from what I've seen in my travels
Anecdotes

>You're expressing your opinion from a Danish perspective, so it's understandable why you'd say so, but the generally accepted opinion is that of what I've mentioned above
You keep saying this, that it's an "accepted opinion", but FGM is also an accepted "opinion" in some places
Just because _your_ opinion aligns with the opinion of this subreddit, which I have mentioned already, that is has an _extremely_ liberal definition of Europe
Where does Europe stop then
Should we include Iran because of it's historic ties with Europe
What about Turkey
Is that European
How about previous colonies like Lebanon
None of those countries are European
You arent European and you're pretty butthurt about it
You "accused" me of not being a "European" official (Im sure there are MEPs that think no Transcaucasia nation is European)

If its the second worst genocide in europe since The Holocaust why havent I heard of it
o.O
Not being a genocide denier here, im really curious why this has gone completely unmentioned in the 5 years of highschool/college history I took
Man, I really feel old now
To me this is one of those events that you're supposed to know about because it was a huge event when it happened, but if you're born after it happened I can see why you might not have heard about it if you don't have an interest in newer European history yourself
And you must have avoided most news stories about the Balkans
But I actually thought they taught this in school, but I guess it varies from school to school
... you know about the Rwandan genocide, right
The only genocides I know of are Nanking, Holocaust and Armenian :p

Glad to see people come together to protest against bigotry and ignorance
I literally don't see any "nazis" in this thread at all, and I've browsed for a damn while now
I feel you're just massively overreacting, as I'm confident that the amount of people who actual are "nazis" don't make up any significant part of the population, just like any other extremist view
I wouldn't personally say that I belong to either side, which gives me a neutral ground to observe from
What I've observed is that the far left definitely uses negative labels more often, such as racist and nazis, to try and simply invalidate people who don't share their opinion, while the right don't seem to do it as much
Such an attitude and behavior towards people that simply disagree with you is not constructive in the slightest, but simply creates a divide, as people aren't going to be interested in any kind of debate

It snowed enough for you to go skiing
I also wondered
I know Madrid can get pretty cold
Snow is also rare in Copenhagen these latter years
Yes
There are many places that get cold but rarely have snow
Overall less snow (and then more extreme outliers)
I think a lot of people are unaware of the atrocities of the communist regime, especially in Eastern Europe, as I personally have only begun to learn about this recently
This is the reason why some countries actually welcomed the Nazis, as they hunted the communists out of their country
This isn't to say the Nazis were a force for good, but they were the shiniest of two turds for some
There's also the communist rule that Eastern Europe were forced under post-WWII, which were tyrannical and authoritarian, which is why these countries have especially strong feelings against communism
I don't disagree with the notion that a majority (50%+) of the presenters are letting their political bias cloud their rational judgement on PragerU, however, there have been decent people on PragerU
Here's a small list, which I quickly created by looking through their catalogue of presenters on their site
* Anders Fogh Rasmussen (Respected former Danish prime minister and former  Secretary General of NATO)
* James Damore (Fired from Google for providing scientifically supported feedback to an affirmative action course that asked for feedback)
* Ayaan Hirsi Ali (A somalian-dutch human's rights critic of Islam, and advocate for the rights and self-determination of Muslim women
* Christina Hoff Sommers (An egalitarian, who is critical of contemporary western feminism
I would say that these are all decent people, even if you might disagree with them
If your system forces its citizens to give up all ideas of money, social classes, and private ownership, then how is that not totalitarian
> And every time anyone or anything questions the current system, they are thrown in with Stalin and Pol Pot and demand excuse for all the myriad deaths under those regimes
What an utterly ridiculous strawman
No, people aren't instantly associated with Stalin and Pol Pot the moment they criticize an aspect of a European capitalist-centered society
Politicians constantly criticize the "current system" that they're in, because that's basically their jobs, and they don't get "thrown in with Stalin and Pol Pot" for it, unless you're advocating from a uniquely extreme platform
If you advocate for higher minimum wages, then the wider public reaction won't be that you're Pol Pot incarnated
Your statement is absurd
The point is that capitalism is a flexible enough framework that is able to include "socialist" policies like the ones you just listed
That is why capitalism is the "least bad" economic system
Just look at capitalist nations like Denmark, Sweden and Norway that have massive public sectors and healthy social security nets, these nations all operate under capitalism and have been able to maintain massive social programs to the benefit of all their citizens
If you're completely ignoring reality, then the discussion exists on an utopian plane that's disconnected from the real world, which could often make the eventual outcome of this discussion inapplicable to the real world
We have seen several different interpretations of communism applied in the real world, and the track record is dreadful, as they frequently result in human suffering
The most important aspect of any economic or political system is the actual real world application
It's easy to create an ideology, where you simply claim that everyone will have everything they need, and no one will be oppressed in any manner
Stating that is an incredibly easy thing to do, but actually making it happen is what ultimately matters, as that's the ultimate test
Communism has repeatedly failed that test of any system
I don't know how many more beta runs people require, before they admit that this communist ideology simply doesn't work well in the real world
You're obviously going to attack capitalism, but the reality is that capitalism has been more succesful in its application, even if isn't perfect
We could simply look at most western countries
It simply has a much better track record, because it accounts much more effectively for human nature, as it doesn't exist on this utopian plane to the same degree as communism
PS: It's not every version of capitalism that allows for total commodification of people's health
Im not arguing that capitalism is brilliant and flawless
However most of the succeses of welfare nations is due to the fact that capitalism is a very flexible system and allows for divergence and market manipulation to a degree
We are constantly looking forward in politics
Constantly arguing over the best ways to improve society, even if we disagree on the how to do that
The only thing that's quite clear to me personally, as someone who is a centrist in Denmark,  is that communism isn't one of those ways forward
Guess which countries have the best democracies
Capitalist countries
Guess which countries had worse democracies
Communist countries

I remember at the 2000 Sydney Olympics I came home at night and turned on danish tv
It was maybe 4am and they were showing some women shooting sports
I have no clue what it was
I guess I was the only danish spectator
And then the commentator
I don’t think he understood the rules and was clearly not at the venue but commenting from a tv studio
A sign came up - with the winner and the big letters AUS - and he proclaimed gold for Austria
The Australian home crowd then celebrated wildly with flags - and with a tired voice he added ‘a popular winner’.
I will never forget that weird moment I shared alone
Like all the other best moments
I had forgot how warm 10 degrees is
The weather is too damn hot
My thermometer registered a sweltering **17°C!**
Yeah its getting 13 degrees today
Satan has risen from hell and is visiting us
Actually true
So true
Was standing in the living room, looking outside on the fog, and the naked trees, wiping sweat off my brow saying "is it hot in here or what
Danish and can confirm
I’m digging out my shorts sandals this week
I for one am happy that it's already t-shirt and shorts weather
Humidity is a helluva drug
35 degrees in southern Europe feels like 20-25 degrees in Denmark
and we welcome him with open arms
10 degrees is kind of the spot where we are still confused on whether we are supposed to melt of freeze
Night temperatures over 15 degrees more or less makes us melt
(aircon is not common at all in private homes, for obvious reasons)
My neighbour whipped out his grill in mid March, while the temperature was still just around freezing
me too fam
Does pepsi taste better in russia
Sounds just like home
Absolutely not true
You can drink anywhere in Denmark, but some streets/parks/areas have ["no drinking in this area"-signs]
Damn, I remember a really good barbecue at 10c last year
Damn, I miss danish summer
We were too
ribs and hot dogs for everyone
IT was awesome
Back in the 90s I worked in Sct Petersburg for a little while
The first party I got invited to turned out to be a lot of people in a small flat, a coffee table filled with all sorts of vodka, and a kitchen table with dark bread, pickles, and fish
It was actually a pretty damn fun party
I learned to sing a few folk songs (badly
) and got accepted as a team member when they found out I would drink and sing with the rest of them
I recall some dancing too, but it gets hazy after that
Protip for Russian vodka: Don't drink anything that comes in a bottle with a cap you can't screw back on again
I swear some of those vodkas were re-labled surgical alcohol
The couple hours before it rained, but yeah, the day as well
uh, excuse me, Capital of what now
Pretty sure I just confirmed it
I didn't miss it
why the swedish are not condicered alcoholist
In the town I'm from when you're extremely drunk you're 'svenskerfuld' Drunk like a Swede
So it's not even the capital if the country it's situated in
How does that work in practice
I am really starting to doubt that Britain will go back to it's old glory days by stepping out of the EU

UK in EU -> now wants to opt out
Scotland in the UK -> now wants to opt out
Seems fair

[As of April 14, 2020, CDC case counts and death counts include both confirmed and probable cases and deaths

There are no second wave as its just the virus moving from new york and through the rest of the country
Its not confirmed cases as the headline says, for the US its confirmed and probable cases
Yeah and that's why you can't come to Denmark you goofy people ;)
Saying conspiracy-theory doesn't count as an argument
Suffering from succes
> You mean the number of daily infections doubling in three weeks is just increased testing
I simply say that you can't compare confirmed cases with confirmed cases PLUS probable cases

''Genghis Khan; the Scourge of China - An inspiration for us all
They absolutely lost their rag because a newspaper in our country posted a satirical cartoon of a Chinese flag with yellow coronavirus particles instead of stars
They sent a ton of social media bots our way and were comparing us to Nazis and everything
Maybe the Opium Wars are not something we should proudly exhibit as a Chinese failure, when it's pretty clear that the West was in the wrong here
A great example of Imperialism and profits over humanity
I don't understand it really
They want to present them selves as the heir to the oldest country in the world, but shit like the cultural revolution seem to indicate that they'd do anything to distance themselves from their history
There's a distinction to be made here
The CCP may be trying to built an idea that modern China is invincible, but it has never claimed that past China was
The term "[Century of Humiliation] is a central part of the CCPs founding philosophy
This, interestingly enough, started with the Opium Wars
Many modern Chinese political terms, such as China Dream and National Rejuvenation are based on the premise of China rising from the ashes (warranted or not), due to them not being invincible or powerful
If anything, using the Opium Wars as an example of Western supremacy over China (or Chinese failures), is much more likely to actually stoke a feeling of needing to fend off the West and to reclaim what was 'taken' (Center stage in the world)
The Opium Wars are viewed as either the worst or second worst thing to have happened to China, as it was literally the start of the subjugation of China and the Century of Humiliation
The Opium Wars are part of this narrative that the CCP is building that the West wants to subjugate and control them (again) and that they must rejuvenate in order to survive this

Get on With the times Germany
He lives on Greenland, everybody knows that
Yeah it was quite frustrating living in Hamburg
I hate cash
No one seems to trust banks, which, given Germany's history, *kind* of makes sense
But this is misdirected skepticism
Germans even hate credit cards because they hate debt
They have some *really* low home ownership rates because mortgage = debt
I think it's just a super conservative country
There are many parallels with Japan, especially given their reliance on, and domination of, their car industries
The practical aspects are the main one for me
Cash tends to get lost, I forget it at home, change is bulky
Additionally, it's much harder to track my spending
I can import my entire spend history into budget planners if it's all on cards - in fact, my bank does it for me now
I also think cards (and I use Apple Pay exclusively now) is more secure
You can steal my phone but good luck spending anything
When I leave the house I don't even take my cards with me
It's just my phone
My door is electronic
It's super simple and super secure
Panic :) No, if I'm honest it doesn't happen
My phone lasts two days easy and if I know I might be away from home for longer than that I bring a charger
Moreover, everyone has an iPhone charger, so if I *really* needed a quick boost I could just ask
Still, in all the years I've been using Apple Pay, this scenario has never come up

Mountain Danes don't count
Ireland says 120 but they have 100 km/h limits on country roads I couldn't feasibly driver faster than 50 on
I want to see a map of how obedient each country is in following the speed limits
Or, rather, the observed average speed
Humans doesn't get any better though
And while modern cars have more features for emergency breaking etc
many people don't drive modern cars
I'm pretty sure most accidents are caused by lapse of attention
Speed limits help limit the damage accidents cause
There's a huge difference between a car crashing at 110 and 200
From my experience driving around Iceland in June last year, Icelanders are happy to drive 100 kph and above on the roads that have the 90 kph speed limit
Breaking distance is at least 50% human reaktion time, which haven't improved at all
And like I mentioned, there are plenty of cars still without modern emergency breaking features
We raised the general limit from 110 to 130 a couple of years ago
The result was more accidents and more people killed in accidents
Yes it is and it's even better in person
It's a gorgeous city and I can't recommend it enough if you're in Spain
It also has some roads, with fantastic views, through the mountains connecting it with the main road system
The city is basically placed on two mountain/"Hill" tops with that bridge connecting them

Most important word for when Europe opens up for travelling again
Additionally, in Denmark, we also have "Bajer" which is generally used in the same context as "you want a *pint*?" Or "want a *Drink*?" Though it's specifically beer, it is more casual
If it did previously mean a specific type of beer, then it generally doesn't anymore
Imagine how much longer it takes to have a beer when you have to say “Hello i would like one GARAGARDOA please” everytime you order
Also lajs, humlegranater, grünes, stifter and many more – as we say, “kært barn har mange navne”:)
And if the island is in a lake it would be sjöööl

By way of logic you're now obligated to say you also love the Danish language
Well that opens the other trap card: Profess your love for the danish language or risk being stamped as "illogical" (a scandinavian cardinal sin)
And here I was thinking that isles meant islands
So there is a part of the Island of Ireland, that isn't Republic of Ireland and isn't Northern Ireland either

Things need to change
It really shouldn't be lauded as antisemitism to propose a ban on male infant circumcision
Especially in a non-Jewish country
It is child protection and an immutable right to bodily integrity
And they are very much in the minority with that statement
Most health organizations in the world with statements on circumcision are opposed to circumcising children:
Swedish Pediatric Society (they outright call for a ban)
Royal     Dutch Medical Association calls it a violation of human rights, and     calls for a "strong policy of deterrence
" this policy has been   endorsed   by several other organizations:
The Netherlands Society of General Practitioners,
The Netherlands Society of Youth Healthcare Physicians,
The Netherlands Association of Paediatric Surgeons,
The Netherlands Association of Plastic Surgeons,
The Netherlands Association for Paediatric Medicine,
The Netherlands Urology Association, and
The Netherlands Surgeons’ Association
College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia
This     procedure should be delayed to a later date when the child can make    his  own informed decision
Parental preference alone does not justify  a    non‐therapeutic procedure
Advise parents that the current  medical    consensus is that routine infant male circumcision is not a   recommended   procedure; it is non‐therapeutic and has no medical   prophylactic  basis;  current evidence indicates that previously‐thought   prophylactic  public  health benefits do not out‐weigh the potential   risks
Routine infant  male circumcision does cause pain and   permanent loss of  healthy tissue
Australian    Federation of Aids  organizations They state that circumcision has  "no   role" in the HIV  epidemic
The German Association of  Pediatricians   called for a ban  recently
The    German Association of  Child and Youth Doctors recently Attacked the    AAP's claims, saying the  benefits they claim, including HIV  reduction,   are "questionable," and  that "Seen from the outside,  cultural bias   reflecting the normality of  non-therapeutic male  circumcision in the US   seems obvious, and the  report’s conclusions  are different from those   reached by doctors in  other parts of the  Western world, including   Europe, Canada, and  Australia
" (scroll to  page 7 for the English   translation
The   AAP was   recently attacked by the President of the British  Association  of   Paediatric Urologists because the evidence of benefit  is weak, and  they   are promoting "Irreversible mutilating surgery
The     College of Physicians and Surgeons of Saskatchewan has taken a    position  against it, saying it is harmful and will likely be considered    illegal  in the future, given the number of men who are angry that it    was done to  them and are becoming activists against it
The President of the Saskatchewan Medical Association has said the same (link above)
The     Central Union for Child Welfare “considers that circumcision of boys     that violates the personal integrity of the boys is not acceptable     unless it is done for medical reasons to treat an illness
The basis  for    the measures of a society must be an unconditional respect for  the    bodily integrity of an under-aged person… Circumcision can only  be    allowed to independent major persons, both women and men, after it  has    been ascertained that the person in question wants it of his or  her own    free will and he or she has not been subjected to pressure
Royal College of Surgeons of England
"The     one absolute indication for circumcision is scarring of the opening   of   the foreskin making it non- retractable (pathological phimosis)
This  is  unusual before five years of age
"..."The parents and, when    competent,  the child, must be made fully aware of the implications of    this  operation as it is a non-reversible procedure
" |
British Medical Association
it     is now widely accepted, including by the BMA, that this surgical     procedure has medical and psychological risks
.... very similar     arguments are also used to try and justify very harmful cultural     procedures, such as female genital mutilation or ritual scarification
Furthermore, the harm of denying a person the opportunity to choose  not    to be circumcised must also be taken into account, together with  the    damage that can be done to the individual’s relationship with his     parents and the medical profession if he feels harmed by the  procedure
.... parental preference alone is not sufficient  justification for    performing a surgical procedure on a child
....  The BMA considers that    the evidence concerning health benefit from  non-therapeutic   circumcision  is insufficient for this alone to be a  justification for   doing it
Australian   Medical   Association Has a policy of discouraging it, ad says "The   Australian   College of Paediatrics should continue to discourage the   practice of   circumcision in newborns
Australian College of Paediatrics:
"The     possibility that routine circumcision may contravene human rights  has    been raised because circumcision is performed on a minor and is   without   proven medical benefit
Whether these legal concerns are valid   will   probably only be known if the matter is determined in a court  of  law   .....Neonatal male circumcision has no medical indication
It  is a    traumatic procedure performed without anaesthesia to remove a  normal  and   healthy prepuce
74%  of   Australian  doctors overall believe circumcision should not be  offered,   and 51%  consider it abuse
Circumcision used to be common in   Australia,  but the  movement against it spread faster there than   America, where  rates  continue to drop
A letter by the South African Medical Association said this:
The     Committee stated that it was unethical and illegal to perform     circumcision on infant boys in this instance
In particular, the     Committee expressed serious concern that not enough scientifically-based     evidence was available to confirm that circumcisions prevented HIV     contraction and that the public at large was influenced by incorrect  and    misrepresented information
The Committee reiterated its view  that it    did not support circumcision to prevent HIV transmission
The     Norwegian Council of Medical Ethics states that ritual circumcision   of   boys is not consistent with important principles of medical  ethics,   that  it is without medical value, and should not be paid for  with   public  funds
The Norwegian Children’s Ombudsman is opposed as well
The Denmark National Council for Children is also opposed
And     recently, the politically appointed Health minister of Norway  opposed  a   ban on circumcision, yet the ban was supported by the  Norwegian   Medical  Association, the Norwegian Nurses Organization, the  Norwegian   Ombudsman  for Children, and the University of Oslo
The Danish Society of Medical Practitioners Recently said the practice is “an assault and should be banned
The     Danish Medical Association is “fundamentally opposed to male     circumcision unless there is a medical reason such as phimosis for     carrying out the operation
‘It's very intrusive that adults may decide     that newborn to undergo a surgical procedure that is not medically     justified and if power is lifelong
When a boy when the age of  majority,    he may even decide, but until then the requirements of the    individual's  right to self-determination prevail
Yes
Are you aware of the subreddit we are in
Circumcision releases large amounts of cortisol in developing brains which has a negative impact, it decreases sexual pleasure, circumcised men have a higher chance of getting erectile dysfunction, most health organizations in the world with statements on circumcision are opposed to circumcising children
Those are the ones I remember off the top of my head
Well America is pretty much the only first would country that has health organizations recomend it
It's also interesting to note that other health organizations have responded to their statements pretty much calling bs, and american health organizations never have a rebuttal, nor do they ever seem to respond to the statements of any other health organization
Also this is r/europe
Yeah
Have you read their statement
It does not speak very positively of circumcision at all
They don't actively say that you must not do it, but it is certainly a lot more negative than the AAP
Also Doctors in Canada are generally not in favor of it, and even use that statement to back up their view
Are you actually implying that health organizations outside of America have a bias because of their financial icentive to sell comics about circumcision
I'm not sure because that's literally insane, but I can't see what else you'd be trying to argue by posting that as a response
They're not, they're concerned about baby penises being cut up
You posted it in response to something saying that doctors in America have a financial incentive to continue the practice, and that other doctors in other countries don't. Also that comic is depicting a brit milah which is a legitimately fucking disgusting practice
Why is portraying it as such anti-semitic
Damn that camera though

Ninja edit: Oh, and I've been ***told*** (and have not verified) that Putin did it to get back at the West for "what they did to Ukraine"
>people should have a right to self determination
They do under certain circumstances, just do a Google search for it
But none of those apply to the Catalonia case at all
However, "people should have a right to self determination
" doesn't just mean that you get to make up your own illegal vote and that the government then has to care about the results
If it did then Barcelona could decide to declare independence from Catalonia next Monday, then northern Barcelona could decide to declare independence from southern Barcelona the week after that, then a neighborhood could leave northern Barcelona, then a block of homes could leave the neighborhood etc
etc
Obviously that's not how the world functions or even *can* function
"people should have a right to self determination
" doesn't mean you just get to do whatever the fuck you want as long as you make up a vote for it
There are still laws, there are still owners of land etc
It's like when the controversial party wins the election, it sucks, but you get the popcorn any way
That way there's at least some good to it
That would probably make Spain veto you guys potentially joining EU if you should decide to go independent at some point though
Politics are complicated
No Greenland
Stay
That's a bit odd honestly, what exactly do those two movements have in common besides the word 'independence'?
Either way, I really wouldn't count on Spain being nice about any country recognizing Catalonia's independence, I'd seriously expect them to veto Scotland ever joining the EU if it was to happen
And the pro-independence folks in Scotland are generally also pro-EU, right
What a mess that could be

in denmark we are a few funny cities names like our capital which if you translate it right its buy a dock, aarhus which is year house, københoved, which looks like københavn our capital the diffence is one is in jylland the other is in sjælland, and one roughly translate to something legal and expensive and the other is a buy a head, we have a cities named barrels, we a town named taller, blue water is also one, an ironic name my hometown esbjerg which roughly translate to ace mountain and if you know denmark youd know why, have a town named the road, we have a town named odder which is the word for otter in danish and there is no otter there, we have one that translate to beer good, and sædding which is sperming, of course we also have the town named cum or sæd
Edit: also Tim, Wind or win (same word in danish), trapdoor, cage, Paris, clear, oddense (not odense), a town named happiness in danish, one named throat, DARKNESS, Dad's island (so that's where all those dads go), Gram, them not a translation, a town called make out, #Humble, and aother beer one this time just beer place, Monking mountain city which is near stonelittle and dianafield which is 8 and a half miles away from piss lake, hope you have a foot fetish then welcome to foot city, rude which is in english window or the english word rude, fan island where i grew up, there is also  Fokkenborg which sounds like fucking castle and it is suppose to i think since there is a rumor of in people who used to live there couldnt hold back of fucking eachother, also pikhade which translate to penishate, bored visit boring,also btw people talk about that wales city alot what about the danish founded new zealand city of  Taumatawhakatangihangakoauauotamateaturipukakapikimaungahoronukupokaiwhenuakitanatahu

You forgot “Londonderry”

Uh a fellow dane
Yeah, that surprised me as well
But most Danes speak English very well
It's not really that uncommon
English is taught in all schools from 1
st grade onwards and no tv or film is ever dubbed over in Denmark unless it's aimed for 5 year olds or younger
To call english a common second language is almost understating it
I watched so many BBC history docs and english languaged cartoons as a kid that I could read and speak english before we were even taught english proper in class, I know alot of people over her have the same experience
That being said I still appreciated getting to know the BIG MUZZY STORY / Muzzy in Gondoland all the same :P
You might end up having to follow all our ^^^^dane laws but with no say, makes me nostalgic

I suppose the real question is why they have statues of the guy in the first place, no why they didn't remove them due to hashtag campaigns
If the guy had the statues built himself, they hold no actual value to society anyway as they're not really about honoring some specific invention, exploration or whatever
Then they're just there for ego
The same goes for the Stalin and Lenin statues for that matter, and I'm sure they'll get around to those any time now
I kinda wish they had either taken it down earlier or later though, you can't make it seem like you give in to the hashtag mob these days as they'll only see it as a motivation to keep moaning
I'm willing to bet that most of them had no idea that statue even existed, they didn't know the first thing about the guy etc
and they really don't give a shit about any specific statue, which is why getting a statue pulled down never makes them stop anywhere
It only makes them move on to the next thing they know nothing about
If experience teaches us anything about those mobs it's that you shouldn't give them an inch
They don't care about some statue they've never even seen of some guy they haven't even bothered looking up, they don't care about some song, some dance, some tradition, some culture or whatever
They just want power over others, which is why they never stop, even after achieving what they were originally campaigning for
So far Leopold has probably been the most worthy of removal anywhere
Even the actions of the conquistadors are childsplay compared to him
But Bismarck is the guy that wanted to unify the German states into a country
Why should he be removed
I was thinking something similar, but I was glad to read this part in the article:
> It will be transferred to a warehouse of a Ghent city museum pending a further decision from a city's commission in charge of decolonisation projects
It sounds like it will be moved from the city to a museum where it will be put in a very different context than as a bust in honour of the man and his deeds
>and the Antwerp centrail railway station will serve to be essentially a cathedral for this man
How so
Is there anything obvious that will make the average person, rather than the history buffs, which will make the average person perceive it as a "cathedral for this man"?
I had a feeling this was the case
Thanks for information
It seems that the only real connection between him and this station is that the money gained from his actions were used to fund the construction of the station, meaning that there is no obvious connection to him, unless you're a history buff
That's what I gathered from other comments in here from people that seem to know hwat they're talking about
PS: Hold up
If you didn't know, then why on earth would you make such a strongly worded statement on it
Why would you have such a strong opinion of something that you didn't know
This is the issue with social media, as it encourages this kind of behaviour
Looks like something from Skyrim, which is a good thing
Since when is Armenia in Europe ? It’s in Asia/Middle East
These people who commenting like “Armenia is in Europe” do not even know what they are defending for
Armenia is in Asia/Middle&East and culture of its people is close to other middle eastern countries
Being Christian is not enough to be an European
These people who commenting like “Armenia is in Europe” do not even know what they are defending for
Armenia is in Asia/Middle&East and culture of its people is close to other middle eastern countries
Being Christian is not enough to be an European
Armenia is in Asia/Middle-East
Nope
Armenia is neither geographically nor culturally in Europe
What ? Are you a FBI agent or sth ? If you are, I’m telling you, you’re not a successful one lol :p
Well according to MyHerritage, I got 12% West Asian DNA so maybe, who knows ? But I’m pretty sure about that I’m an white a** European lol
Well actually I’m not ethnically Turkish but being Turkish sounds good
I liked it

You could pour thousands of euro into that system without actually getting what you were going for

And this gambling is targeted at young people and children
You'd never find a true Dane enjoying the weather — it's always too cold, too hot, too wet, too dry, etc
It's even part of our old national anthem:
Sig mig hvad fanden
oh, men så hold dog kæft, din fjeldabe
You can use "fint" in Danish too
As a Dane, this is so wrong
It's not inaudible, it's incomprehensible
This is misleading
There is no nice weather in denmark
Source: I live in denmark
fite me swedo
It's encryption built right into the language
As a dane, I hate that mute h.
Triggered
Also, the more idiomatic way to say this is "**sikke** et dejligt/fint vejr vi har i dag"
"sikke" is easier to pronounce than "vilket", in my opinion
But hey, it goes against the trite "kamelåså" joke, so eh
Yeah "dejligt" is more like "lovely" while "fint" is more like "neat/nice or even pretty" but could also be more like "alright". Fint is more mild for weather description
Addtional, "väder" seriously, hva' fuck Sverige
Hovedværk (Danish) = (author's) main work
Huvudvärk (Swedish) = headache
Græde (Danish) = cry
Grädde (Swedish) cream
Flink (Danish) = nice
Flink (Swedish) = skilled
Language is fun
Väskor (Swedish) = Bags
Væsker (Danish) = Liquids
"Tasker" is the Danish word for bags, but apparently that's Swedish slang for whores
Yes, I did work in an airport on the Danish/Swedish border
Why do you ask
Ahh, gode gamle tv2
No, we've never ever heard that reference before, sorry
I hate that meme
There are so many fun memes making fun of our superior language, yet people latch onto that boring one
They're from Skåne; calling Danish hard to grasp is a mere distraction
It is almost universal for all the germanic languages
The þ and ð sounds changed a lot over time, but they changed different in all germanic languages
þ became th in english, d og th in scandinavian languages, d in german
The english call it the great vowel shift, but it happened to all germanic languages
Weather comes from wedrą.
In danish it went wedra(proto germanic)-> veðr(Norse) -> vejr(danish)
In english it went wedra(proto germanic) -> wedar(old saxon) -> weder(old and middle english) -> weather(modern english)
More of a state of mind, really
the temptation to reply "...said the bosnian" is too great
The only mistake of the Stockholm Bloodbath was that the Danish and Norwegian nobility should have been executed, too
Yea, sorry bout that
Looking up the etymology for "dejligt," it looks like it comes from an old Germanic word - "degelik" meaning "good" as in skilled - which seems to have otherwise been forgotten
Also:
Kunstig (Danish) = artificial
Konstig (Swedish) = weird
Frokost (Danish) = lunch
Frukost (Swedish) = breakfast
Kittel (Danish) = smock
Kittel (Swedish) = kettle
Krydsild (Danish) = crossfire
Kryddsill (Swedish) = spiced herring
Skede (Danish) = vagina/sheath
Skede (Swedish) = phase
Talrig (Danish) = numerous
Tallrik (Swedish) = plate
Væske (Danish) = liquid
Väska (Swedish) = bag
Don't forget;
Danish: *Coronastrategi*
Swedish:
The go-to Danish middle school German class willful mistranslation (as in it was so common that it was one of the first sentences we learned), was "Der Tür ist böse
Now this obviously doesn't make any sense to a German speaker as it translates to "The door is angry," but it in Danish it is very similar to "Tyren er bøsse," which translates to "The bull is gay," which is a profoundly funny sentence to 12 year olds
Of other semi-purposely wrong German sentences I can remember "Guten heute, Leute" definitely stands out
Again it doesn't make sense - the intended purpose is to say "Hello  everyone," but it is more like "Good today, people
But it sounds great and I for one think the German council of words should embrace it
Danish one is frokost
Nerdonændene er bare danskere der er blevet lidt forvirrede
Eye, the derogatory term for swedes is "svensker"
Sweden has never ruled Denmark
Denmark has however ruled Sweden for more than a century
Hell, Scania (and Blekinge and Halland) has been Danish for longer than it has been Swedish
Well I wouldn't translate "tryk" to push that'd be "skub"
The way I heard it was " Ich bin böse und ich knalle mit die Tür", which translates to "I am angry and I slam the door", but in Danish it sounds like "I'm gay and I fuck with the bull".
It only exists in that sketch tbf, kamelåså isnt a real word in Danish
I don't
Indeed we are Like siblings, dont really Like each other
BUT IF ANYONE ELSE THEN ME MESSES WITH MY FAMILY they are going to regret it
Seems so
agreed, "tryk" would be press or pressure
Press the button: tryk på knappen
Under pressure: under tryk
Oppressed: undertrykt
Tryk is  just like the German "drück".
Morgenmad (morning food)
That's the one
It's been a few years since I was in school
I'd like to say yes, but mainly it's because it's 20 years since I had a German lesson
edit: And also because: Fuck German genders
I'd definitely be on board if the transphobes first target was der/den/dem/des+s and all that other shit
Reminds me of the difference of how Norwegians and Danes google the Dano-Norwegian kingdom
In Norway it's: "When was Denmark and Norway in a union
In Denmark it's: "When did Denmark own Norway
Denmark trounced Sweden like 50 times between the late 13th century and the early 16th century
So, no
So that's what they meant with "abolishing genders"
Languages only need two genders: Common and non
Right over
The utter dominance of Denmark in the 14th century is the reason why Norway as a whole and the Swedish commoners dethroned their nobility to elevate the Danish royalty to ac as their own
To focus on latter battles that never amounted to the spoils Denmark gained, is as willfully ignorant as celebrating a ship that sunk on its way out of port #NAVYSTRONG
Oh damn
How will we as the second largest European country ever explain to the sixth largest, how we came to be so small

> Kapitel 8
>Grønlands adgang til selvstændighed
>§ 21
**Beslutning om Grønlands selvstændighed træffes af det grønlandske folk
>Stk
Træffes beslutning efter stk
1, indledes der forhandlinger mellem regeringen og Naalakkersuisut med henblik på gennemførelse af selvstændighed for Grønland
>Stk
En aftale mellem Naalakkersuisut og regeringen om gennemførelse af selvstændighed for Grønland skal indgås med samtykke fra Inatsisartut og skal godkendes ved en folkeafstemning i Grønland
Aftalen skal endvidere indgås med samtykke fra Folketinget
>Stk
Selvstændighed for Grønland indebærer, at Grønland overtager højhedsretten over Grønland
fra [Loven om Grønlands Selvstyre af 2009]
Greenland isn't Finland, and Denmark isn't Sweden
They are literally free to leave if they decide to do so
Unlike Finland under Swedish rule
Formalitet
Formålet med loven var at formalisere vejen til Grønlands selvstændighed og blev indgået med det eksplicitte krav fra grønlandsk side at det var Grønland ikke Danmark, der kunne beslutte sig for eller imod selvstændighed
1 i sagsforløbet]
>Lovforslaget har endelig til formål at fastsætte ordningen for beslutningen og gennemførelse af en beslutning om Grønlands selvstændighed
>Det fremgår endvidere af kommissoriet, at der mellem den danske regering og Grønlands landsstyre er enighed om, at det tilkommer det grønlandske folk at afgøre, hvorvidt Grønland ønsker selvstændighed, og at nyordningen intet ændrer herved, og at selvstændigheden i givet fald skal gennemføres ved indgåelse af en aftale herom efter reglerne i grundlovens § 19
Kommissionens forslag til en nyordning skal efter kommissoriet indeholde en bestemmelse om Grønlands adgang til selvstændighed i overensstemmelse hermed
og dette bliver gentaget utallige gange, så dansk indflydelse på grønlandsk selvstændighed kan højst betragtes som de jure
Igen
Det er allerede blevet aftalt at folketingets godkendelse er en formalitet
Loven er vedtaget på dette grundlag
Grundloven er 170 år gammel
Nogen gange er man nødt til at nedfælde ord for at undgå at skulle til at ændre den
§19 som der henvises til siger eksempelvis at det er Kongen, der bestemmer på udenrigsområdet
De gør Kongen de jure
Hvor meget skal vi gi' for de jure i det tilfælde
Jeg har ret du tager fejl
Sådan er det bare

This is so going to be the embarrassing story at my wedding: when I was kid, I thought the same
I was told, "islands has water all around". We live, and think, in 3D. All around means below too
The very embarrassing part is that I liked geology and geophysics from when I was quite young (from at least age 12 that's what I wanted to study), so I thought that islands were floating, but also knew about plate tectonics at the same time
I knew, though, that islands like Britain or the islands of Denmarks aren't islands, since it just continent that happens to be not flooded, as opposed to the Baltic and North sea .. But I thought that actual islands, like Hawaii and Fiji, had water underneath them
It didn't go away in my mind until I learned about volcanic hot spots and the formation of Hawaii, and not even fully then
Years later, and this is the really embarrassing part, I even said something to the likes of "so when the plate moves away from the hot spot, then the new underwater "rock" will disappear and it will become an island" - and I did this in a bachelors class in geophysics
Luckily not in forum, but to my friends during break
My mind just can't let that "islands have water all around" go away
I have a similar problem with "current is the flow of electrons" and I still have to mentally pause and correct myself
You are free to leave though
Excuse me for messing with the self-fulfilling circlejerk prophecy, but not necessarily
In Denmark, back in the day, it was the poor country districts which managed to get their sh*t together and form a movement of schools and education for everyone, regardless of class
No reason for a farmer to be a know-nothing, nor his wife
To this day, it is called the "Highschool Movement" (or ["Folk High School"] but that's a potentially poor translation imho) - "a citizen-school for life" - founded by [N. F. S. Grundtvig]
Btw, he was a preacher, so religion isn't an excuse
> perhaps 'dumb' (poor) people might just have different interests, values, and opinions
Which they (in the case of wanting an autoritarian rule) have because they are uneducated
I would liken it to isulating you house with asbestos: If you are uneducated about asbestos it seems like a pretty good idea, it's fireproof, cheap and a good insulator
On the other hand if you are educated on what asbestos leads to down the line, lung cancer, mesothelioma and asbestosis you won't use it
Yes in theory it could be that these uneducated people just like lung cancer but I would be much more likely to assume that they just didn't know
And while I would say that it's not intrinsically wrong to isulate with asbestos, we as humans can look at the damage it causes and judge it as wrong or not a good thing
Everyone in that train is about to be down with the sickness
Why the heck did they do that
In Denmark the government asked the public transportation companies to get as many trains and buses rolling as possible, so people wouldn't be crowded together
Buses also don't pick up passengers if they're already half full
That was the strategy for the first few days indeed, but ever since, trains have been running less often than they did before the crisis, with the explanation given being illness levels among staff;
Then it makes sense
True, but they're still trying to compensate by running longer trains with more capacity
[A video about the strategic aspects of the war]
Is there a list of the companies involved, or just something remotely close to that
I would love to find out who's behind
Sometimes it feels like it would just be easier if you just let us Nordics rule your goddamned countries

The world doesn't blink in large part because words have been destroyed
Everybody is a racist, everything is a genocide
Thus nobody is a racist, nothing is a genocide - or ethnic cleansing
And when people read a report of an ethnic cleaning they go, "meh
Third time this week
This article is about alleged ethnic cleansing of Kurds in Turkey, Northern Syria, and Western Iraq
It didn't bother to make the case that it is in fact an ethnic cleansing (a few bombs don't make the cut)
So I'll have to say nonsense
I'm tired of so-called news media coming with bombastic ideological proclamations
Put out the numbers, make the case, or shut the fuck up
News media has become such a load of untrustworthy bullshit
I don't care much about Turkey either way, and Erdogan can go fuck himself, but I have to wonder how much of this recent drummed up anti-Turkey outrage is part of an orchestrated campaign
So I'm going to take the contrary position on this
At least I'm going to have to think thrice before letting myself become enrolled in somebody's political agenda
I’m not the biggest fan of the conservative Turkish leader but you guys cannot summarize this as ethnic cleansing the fighting with terrorist organizations in the middle east
I cannot forget what they did in France,U.K and Germany in 2016-2017 period
So, they are doing well what they do
True, although there can be no question that Turkey doesn't treat the Kurds fair to put it mildly, calling it ethnic cleansing might be taking it too far

Armenian Genocide 2: Azerbaijani Boogaloo
Armenia is a certified invader by U.N in this topic and this news is NOT proven
You guys are just crazy
This news is not proved
Most probably Armenian propaganda to hook Europeans interest
So what do you want Azerbaijan to do then ?  Just sitting and accepting all groundless accusations ? Also I’m not saying to Armenia to share their martial codes, I’m just saying if they are pretty sure about their statement, then they have to put forth their sources
I don’t think you understand how NATO work then
The airspace of most eastern European NATO members are protected by western European NATO members
While the transatlantic relation is strained missions are still pretty much carried out as usual
Most eastern European countries are part of NATO and I don’t think that NATO is de facto the USA
A lot of coorperation is happening betwen many member states under the NATO umbrella without american involvement
The Eurofighter for examples, is not developed through the EU, but through the NATO Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency
Also # of jets is not a key figure, # of operational ones are
Russia is however not a superpower, but a regional one

Funny how scandnavia and netherlands have monarchies and we are all happy with while being the most developed countries in the world
Stay mad republics
Literal king
fucking french bastard
I think part of it is the difference betwen knowing what a monarchy is and thinking that you know what it is
I guess a lot of people believe that monarchies works like in Disney or Game of Thrones
Like people saying that monarchs are only monarch, because their ancestors killed enough people, while in reality the three scandinavian royal families was elected into their position
We can still have an opinion about monarchies in other countries
Most Saudis like their monarch, but we can still critique him
And no, im not comparing an actual monarch with power to yours, just saying thats a weird argument
I mean most monarchs does matter
State visits are still a thing
Monarchs are pretty good at insuring a peaceful transfer of power and that you can have non-political appointed judges and civile servants
> Also, people should choose democratically their head of state
Why
I mean there is a lot of people working in the state that are not elected by people
I actuelly think that the head of state being elected is one of the weak points of republics
If the head of state and his party can establish a voting majority in the legal assembly, then you can essentialy coup the republic
That seems to be main way to turn democratic republics into dictatorships

Kinda ironic how we once owned so much, and now so little
For some reason I Founder it hilarious with the norwegian flag on crimea
But then what would they have done with Norway
This was actually quite nice
Thanks OP
Yeah, could've been a swedish flag
Or a dutch flag, if this map was made by an american
Came here to make this sentiment

I was stranded at Gatwick for something like 18 hours a handful of years ago because a cm or two of snow had fallen
I was prepared to grab a shovel and some salt and go clear the fucking thing myself after the first five hours in that hellish airport
37% humidity currently, that's super dry
The wind is not so strong in the [inland climates] Because of the [wind chill factor] the -5 C in Denmark seems more like -20 C with middle wind around 8 m/s.
Judging by the Olympics, it isn't being terraformed to fit he Russians, Norway
Tell me about it
It's minus -4 in Esbjerg, but according to my app, due to wind and humidity it feels like -14
Feelscoldman
The UK was one of the warmest countries in Europe today, it was even colder in parts of Spain and Italy
I bet the wind adds -5 degrees at least tho, my ears nearly froze off today :O
Oh man, the food was actually one of the more significant issues
There just wasn't anything left, because flights were being cancelled or delayed left and right
And of course, you couldn't expect anything from the airlines, when they were called Ryanair, Norwegian, EasyJet, etc
People were almost fighting over some cold, boring sandwiches that were left in one of those WHSmith stores (I think)
Its fucking horrible right now, literally feels like death
80% humidity -8C and 30-50 km/h winds this morning
For sure
Taking the bike anywhere is a nightmare and I'm sure my fingers will fall off on my way home
my gears froze solid over night on my bike
That combined with wind is not fun
How do I unsubscribe from winter
Ryanair were honestly too experienced
They cancelled the flight the night before, so we had to pick up some tickets with Norwegian, as they had not cancelled their flights
Instead, they just got delayed by some 15-16 hours and had to deal with loads of pissed customers, while Ryanair could kind of just sit back
I hate those fuckers for being so damn cheap, that I cannot *not* fly with them ...
Tell me about it ;_; Roughly 10 minutes into my ride to/from work with my shitty thin gloves, and its all icy cold pain
But now I got hot choco so I can forget about it until tomorrow :3
Fuck that noise
I'm staying inside for as long as I can today
I'm a student, so I don't have that many choices if I want to go somewhere
I generally try to fly EasyJet or Norwegian instead of Ryanair though
I actually flew BA in October 2016 to LAX and back again and thought it was quite nice, but then again at this point I'm used to no legroom, no service, no nothing
But yeah
No doubt that I'll be looking to avoid Ryanair at all costs once I'm done with my studies and hopefully become a bit more stable financially
To be perfectly honest, BA was only on the returning flight as the LHR-LAX one was operated by American Airlines
Brand new 777, where I was lucky enough to have the four middle seats all for myself
Never has anyone slept as comfortably in coach before
But on the way back, with BA, it was one of their A380's. It was quite nice, but really not as good as those new 777's.

Tolkien visited the valley in 1911, and all but confirmed it in a later letter:
>I am [...] delighted that you have made the acquaintance of Switzerland, and of the very part that I once knew best and which had the deepest effect on me
The hobbit’s journey from Rivendell to the other side of the Misty Mountains, including the glissade down the slithering stones into the pine woods, is based on my adventures in 1911 [...] Our wanderings mainly on foot in a party of 12 are not now clear in sequence, but leave many vivid pictures as clear as yesterday

As impressive as her career was, she had a couple of kids, cared for her dying husband AND was editor in chief for the her university paper
I'd like to add that I think the exact same thing about men who don't have more hours than the rest of us, but still have a career AND kids
The Rock is a good example
I really like the guy, but how can he be in every movie, be a businessman on the side, work out every day for hours and STILL get enough sleep to remember scripts and be in an anabolic state while still have a relationship with his kids

Question: Is Austria as bad as most other modern nations with it's domination of 2-3 parties of the system
Or is this an extreme feat for the Green Party
Well it will strengthen the EU, with more cooperation between our countries and less individual nationalism/isolation (closed borders)
With UK leaving EU it's a very tense situation in Europe
Every country has gained a lot of right wing followers during the last couple of years and they are basicially all calling for less EU, which would mean (if they got it their way) that every country is more on their own
If countries like France, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, Poland were to follow UK and leave, it would ruin much of the unity that has characterized Europe post ww2
Luckily (in my opinion), Germany (the most powerfull European country) is looking pretty solid

At the 2015 Roskilde Festival I shared a beer and a joint with a Norwegian guy called Christian who told me he was Norwegian royalty, but that he probably never would have to do any official princing around just cause he was like 18th in the line of succesion or something similar
Honestly, I never would have belived it if he didn't look so surprisingly wellgroomed and clean for a Guy attending Roskilde, and if he hadn't had a little posse of sober looking people with him that seemed to be checking the surroundings alot
I mean he might very easily just have said the whole thing to get some laughs and a bit of my Jay and his friends might have seemed slightly on Edge because of the surroundings infront of the orange stage but whenever I meet any Norwegian thats an atleast half decent person I try to get them merry and partying just because they are so much fun to let loose with, I mean, he didn't have to do the Elaborate ruse but you know, I know what my story Will be next time I visit Norge
Oh Yeah hi, Prince Karl Toffel the 3rd of house Oldenburg here, kan I have beer and bacon for free pls

For Norway it is also about exporting electricity which earns the energy sector a lot of money
Plus energy consumption will likely increase in Norway as a result of growth in your heavy industries (oil, aluminium etc) and household consumption (electric cars etc)
Denmark reach the target before the negotiations even started
Sure
I wasn't clear
I was just trying to explain why it makes sense to expand renewable energy generation even though you are at a 100 (for electricity) already
It is a good thing
And even if there is no will to develop more hydro it makes sense to develop wind in Northern Norway as there is a lot of complimentarity between the weather up there and in the North Sea area where most European wind generation will be situated in the future
This surely isn't the case in Denmark
We have the highest share of wind in the grid and one of the highest rates of reliability in Europe
We don't even need central power plants for stability any more
I know
My point is that it is possible to have reliable electricity distribution  without big central power plants
Even though Denmark still depend on those (coal, biomass and gas) there are periods where the Danish grid rely solely on import and decentral generation (e.g. wind and solar)

Speaking of, Sweden as well should come back under their rightful rulers
You're right, I meant in the Nordics
Sadly not a lot of love for art deco around here
Damn, I love that style - but all in all, I believe a mixture of buildings constructed in varying styles are best for a city
As long as it's not a steel-and-glass cube with no other details, I'm all for it
Not in my experience
Modernism has mostly been displaced by postmodernism for a few decades now, and from my own personal experience, those I've talked to all prefer the postmodernist look over the modernist
If you look at something like Taipei 101 or Burj Khalifa, those are postmodernist structures
Yes, they're steel and glass, but they're not just boxes - they have interesting shapes and forms
Whereas the old NY WTC buildings 1 and 2 were pure boxy international style modernism
Hmm, I think that's a bit of a simplification
Deco drew inspiration from many different styles, including mesoamerican and other traditional tribal styles
It had all the detail that earlier styles did, but with a very distinctive style, whereas modernism was more of a reaction against the very idea of detailed construction ("a house is a machine for living in")
As such, I think Deco was just the latest in a line of opulent styles of construction, which was what modernism rebelled against
Many features of deco, such as streamlined design of buildings, haven't been seen before or since, except in post-modernist buildings that specifically draw inspiration from art deco

Often when I read something in Norwegian it takes me a few sentences before I realise that it's not Danish

If you don’t want to adopt German culture, you don’t get to be a German citizen

** Fuck them
Hopefully one day we immediately deport people like this
No, I’m not being hyperbolic
I want these assholes to make *damn* sure they’re willing to leave their evil values behind when they migrate
If they don’t want to do that they shouldn’t come
Same in Denmark, here you have to shake hands with the mayor of your town and a bunch of other people at a ceremony where you receive the citizenship
If you refuse to shake hands with either of these people, you cannot get a citizenship and as it is a bunch of people, it's rare there is no women in the group
idk if its like that in germany, but in denmark you have to shake hands in order to pass the citizenships test
they did this because they knew muslim women didnt want to shake hands with men, so they force them to
Good
I do know the general hatred towards the Turks because of the political stuff on here but the thing is at least they are more civilized and europeanized than these radical people who migrated from the Third World countries

The beef between the Dutch and the sea just ascended to a new level
No way
How would all the rivers be drained
This is a solid idea
Sincerely, Denmark (average elevation 34 m)
Can we make the Brits pay for it
We can always depend on the Dutch to come up with these dam solutions
I don't see any reason why that couldn't work if people were willing to pay for it all
However, the potential problem with dikes, dams etc
is obviously them failing at some point
Imagine if the water outside that dam is just a meter higher than on the inside, and the dam then breaking somewhere
Imagine the amount of water that'd suddenly come rushing in towards the low lying areas we wanted to protect in the first place
It may be the best idea we're ever going to see though so we'd better hope they're well made and will last for a long time
I can't be the only one getting an archeology boner from the though of the neolithic stuff we could find down there
> However, effectively closing off the entire North and East Sea can't be good for the ecosystem
When we build this dam the ecosystem will be destroyed anyhoo
> Atlantropa
Kinda a akin to this idea
I still believe in making a massive saltwater lake in Egypt
Mexico
The water would recede gradually so in theory you could make blanket geophys screenings of the entire area as it drains
It would need to be highly automated, like autonomous vehicles and analysis done by AI, but it' within the realm of possibility
Of course geophys won't catch everything, quite on the contrary in the case of the neolithic, but it would be a chance to do something before it's all turned into wheat fields

Something, something, World Series, only American teams, something
Also, here are some of the countries in the world cup finals not from South America or Europe
Mexico, Australia, South Korea, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Senegal and Egypt
Ahh right sorry my bad
But still, it shouldn't come as a surprise that the top 4 nations in the world are from one of those 2 continents, considering how big a part of our culture football really is
It's the same thing with basketball
Since the Berlin Olympics in 1936, the USA have been in the top 3 every single time, except for the Moscow Olympics in 1980 (and they probably would have been in the top 3 if they had participated)
Also, they won gold medals 15 out of 19 times, honestly it's more exciting to see who will win silver and bronze
Well, they can just pay star players to accept Qatari citizenship and then proceed to assemble an all star national team from these players

You see benefits, I see hours and hours of unproductive work in administrative costs
Just more virtue signalling implemented as busy work to manage and oversee that all these rules are being enforced which does not increase the wealth of a nation but rather subtracts from it

Oddest comment so far
The EU does the exact opposite and you're not allowed to make special tax deals
Which is why Ireland is currently in court over Apples 14 billion euro tax bill
This is going to set the proceedings for other cases
The only thing you can complain about is the EU not being able to enforce it more effectively
However if they were people would be crying about how the EU has too much power over the member states and that the EU has become a federal superstate
That's actually insane
It’s like a Phoenix
Denmark: [We're down with bridges too - and artifacts
Something always bothered me about that design
While the notes themselves get longer and longer, why does it not start with the shortest bridge for the 50kr note and then use longer and longer bridges as you go up in value
Now we have the shortest of the bridges on the 200kr note, and that's just silly
Our largest bill, the 1000 kr
is 134,36 €. Now that our banks have negative interest on savings, I think a lot of people are seriously considering taking money out of the banks and storing them in cash
Large bills like the 500€ would be good for that purpose
And yes, it probably would be smarter to invest, but that is risky, and with the corona virus still around, the future of the economic situation has become harder to predict

May I ask what camera / phone / whenever you used to take it
This is such an outrageous claim that it is frankly absurd
> it’s probably the only way to transition away from fossil fuels fast enough
This is straight untrue
Wind is both cleaner and cheaper as well as much less environmentally invasive than nuclear
The dialogue on nuclear is always on nuclear vs fossil fuels, which is a completely pointless debate
The actual debate should be on what the best alternatives to fossil fuels are, a catagory where there's significantly more options than just nuclear as Reddit would like us to believe
There's so many issues facing nuclear power that makes it just about the worst solution we could choose to transition away from fossil fuels
Nuclear power is costly
*Significantly* more so than the alternatives
People in the UK are currently looking at having to pay 2
5 times as much for power generated from Hinkley Point (once it finishes) as they are right now
The only clean part of nuclear is the process itself
Construction and decomissioning of the plant, disposal of nuclear waste along with extraction of Uranium are all incredibly damaging to the environment as well as emitting significant amounts of carbon (not comparable to how much fossil fuels emit, but still a very notable amount)
And finally, and this is frankly the biggest issue facing clean energy production, it has a pronounced lack of flexibility
Flexibility in energy production is incredibly important as was clearly shown in Texas just a month ago
Nuclear isn't realistically able to meet the flexible demand for energy (and neither is wind or solar for that matter), yet it is of vital importance that we find a way to generate clean and flexible energy as currently the best solution is looking to be natural gas (which obviously isn't sustainable in the long term)
And just to preempt the "but nuclear power is flexible" crowd
Yes, it is physically possible but the economic side of things make it an impossiblity, not to mention that the carbon emission resulting from flexible nuclear power would be comparable to that of fossil fuels, which kind of defeats the point
I spent some time researching this topic as it is a rather interesting debate, despite how lopsided it is on Reddit
Trying to take a step back and take an objective stance on the topic it became abundantly clear that Nuclear Power is just about the worst solution to the energy crisis short of sticking with fossil fuels
I can provide peer-reviewed research on every claim I made above if it is of interest to anyone
No it does not
Nuclear power totals 66
08g CO2/kWh (analysis made by Sovacool and Valentine in *The National Politics of Nuclear Power: Economics, Security and Governance)
* They have a complete breakdown of the sources of emission as well if you're interested
This is compared to the 11 g/kWh for onshore wind, 12g/kWh for offshore wind and 27 g/kWh for solar
It's still a far cry from the 490 g/kWh of natural gas (the "cleanest" of the fossil fuels)
This is including operation, maintenance, construction, decomissioning and fabrication
Regardless, I honestly think it is the least relevant point to discuss
If we could achieve anything near 66g/kWh emission for the entire energy sector we would've come a *very long* way to solving the crisis
It doesn't even have to last that long
Just long enough for us to transition fully to other energy sources
I think that's being very optimistic about when we will be 100% renewable
Its not only about us (Europe) either but also about more poor areas who will definitely not be 100% renewable in 10 years
Also the last place to be hellenic in ck2 769 start date
Also, a reaaaally large portion of the "christians" here are probably christians by tradition only
Don't go to church, don't pray, but attend funerals and celebrate christmas
If you want to measure christianity then self-identification gets really sloppy
I know i’m about to be downvoted into oblivion by Le Atheists but i think this is sad
I identify as cultural christian/agnostic christian and don’t really believe in god but I like going to church on holidays and I adore cathedrals
To think that in the future even on Easter Sunday my church probably won’t fill up or that maintenance of old churches won’t be prioritised makes sad
And good riddance
Thank god
Good man
From looking at this thread it is obvious
The Union can stand no longer we shall split into two entities, the ones who like pineapple and the **Scum
I will never understand ananas (hah
) on pizza
I like ananas but it completely overwhelms the taste of everything else on the pizza
It's not like it's a "mild" tasting fruit after all
I see it like most other fruits tbh
I like oranges, bananas, and strawberries as well but I don't want them on my fucking pizza
Make some sort of dessert with ananas, oranges, bananas or whatever and I'm fine with it but don't kill my pizza
I actually like the taste of pizza so completely overwhelming it with the ananas taste is just awful
It's like the people who want coffee that tastes of cola, berries, beer etc

It's not that the taste of coffee, beer, berries, liquorice and cola is bad but that doesn't mean it all goes together
I also like salmon, nutella and red wine but don't fucking mix them

Woah, things are happening . They are happening fast right now
Yea like Russia and Pluto
Now all their troubles have not been in vain
Honestly what the fuck happened to England and tuition fees
Just some ten years ago before I started my uni degree I looked into going to the UK and then I believe it was £3000 per year
£9000 per year is absolutely fucking insane, honestly and afaik it is not even just oxbridge but all unis because setting it lower than the maximum by law would indicate you being a "lesser" school
Can anyone tell me how Scotland is not breaking EU freedom of movement of English students by doing this
There would be a lot of interested Danish politicians in how to stop EU students from studying in Denmark
Amazing how badly managed the UK is
And still people elect Tory governments
It's weird
I'm pretty sure this is inaccurate
Atleast in my case I've been informed (by student advisers at Scottish universities) that I as a EU citizen have to pay same tuition fees like UK students
Options are either specific loans or looking into programmes like the Eramus programme
So I have no idea what this post is about
Maybe I've missed some vital information somewhere
> Currently, EU students are charged the same level of tuition fee as UK students
The University is still finalising fee levels for 2019
We expect to announce them shortly
It is encouraging though that the Scottish government has already committed to providing the same level of funding support for EU students applying for postgraduate study in 2019-20
EU students can apply for a tuition fee loan up to £5,500
It's pretty obvious that Scotland can't offer free education to the rest of the UK with the ways the prices in the rest of their country are going
Everyone from England, Wales and Northern Ireland would go to Scotland for a free education which Scotland obviously can't afford
When Scotland offers students from Denmark (or whatever similar country out there
) a free education it's not nearly as big of a problem as Denmark already has free education that doesn't require people to move "far" (relatively speaking) away to get it
The vast majority of Danish students study in Denmark even though they can get free education elsewhere as well
If an English student had to option to save ~9k a year by going to school a bit further north, Scotland would be overrun by students taking advantage of their system, and they'd need massive financial help from the rest of the UK to fund that
In that case they might as well just get rid of the insane costs in England instead and spend that funding there
So where is all this money going
The universites are public, are they not
I assume the administration is being paid generously
When I visisted Cambridge I was told that the university owns basically most of downtown
I think this system is more classist than a tax-funded system
Poor people who grew up in a home that barely made ends meet are less likely to take on crazy amount of debt just to go to school
Aren't all the student loans in the US federally backed
How so
Genuinly curious
>But it's not debt that you have to pay if you don't make money
No, I completely understand
My point is if you are from a low income family and your family has no educational background and have always been carpenters or whatever
Then taking on £9000 per year is extremely daunting and your family will think you are fucking crazy for wanting it
This will discourage some
In Denmark where I am from, university is free and you get financial support from the govt
and we have some of the highest upward social mobility in the world
>The system increases access to poor people
I completely disagree
Ahh, yes
Yeah - big conumdrum
And sad for the UK
Sorry but that is not how it works
In Denmark, the lower social echelon of society takes a lot of resources and the top echelon pays a lot of taxes
So for a short while the university student has his/her education paid for by everyone - including the uneducated - but afterwards they contribute in taxes for the healthcare, childcare, eldercare, unemployment for the uneducated
The goverment already subsidizes startups here
EDIT: and the entire agriculture business
Delays infection speed, which can spread people who needs to be hospitalized over a longer period causing less strain on the healthcare system
Wow, take it easy buddy
I'm merely repeating what the government officials told us
I was not stating my own opinion
It doesn't matter who I listen to
My voice has no political power anyway
I didn't vote for the current government and they will sit there for at least 3 more years until we find out if people liked their handling of the crisis or not at the voting booth
But to me it does make a certain degree of sense that having less people means less people to get infected and less people needing hospital beds
Now I'm really curious
What exactly encompasses "all the good Napoleon did"? Because I have only ever heard him portrayed in a negative light
Fair enough
I must admit I never really studied him closely
I just know him as the emperor of France who committed atrocities and waged a whole lot of wars
And apparently that's enough to get you downvoted on here
True, in the end it was a bourgeois revolution that only replaced the old masters with new
This is the good kind of renovation, much better then modern renovation that destroy buildings
I worry about europe in general but specifically France
I don't even want to imagine what its like in 50-100 years if nothing is done about this

What is the word you were going for OP
Because it seems you have a mix of "shit", "satan" & "crap".
Not the same word though
Lort
Come on, that's just a slightly spicier word for poo, doesn't even count as shit
We say fanden, or Satan
Danish has the “fandens” too
Luxembourg cuss word #1: Tax
Kind of impossible to find a native translation since we just use "fuck" as a loan word all the time
Dane: Swede
Swede: We were talking curse words
Dane: Exactly
Pis, for fanden, satans, for helvede, fandens også, og sikkert flere jeg ikke lige kan komme i tanke om
Men jeg har aldrig hørt nogen bruge lort
Porca
I hardly know 'er
Jeg synes for fanden / fandens også er ved at blive gammeldags
Pis og fuck er vel de mest brugte
Det er også virkelig mundret
Jeg bruger "lort" ofte omkring ting
"Det er noget lort", "saml det der lort op". Selv hvis det er ting jeg er glad for
Stadig en bunke lort
Men hvis det bliver brugt i samme ånd som putain, scheisse eller fuck, så tror jeg helt klart "pis" og "fuck" er meget mere populære blandt danskere
Det vil jeg i hvert fald give dig ret i. Det er nok de to jeg bruger mest i hvert fald

There's a lot of curviness in art deco too, although it's usually streamlined/smooth curves, which fits well with the cowl of the Reaper here, and also the neck on the man is a smooth line
Furthermore, Art Deco tends towards an idealized view of the human, which is the reason for the muscular build which is repeated in many art deco sculptures (such as the Yuri Gagarin statue in Moscow)
Art Deco was popular both in the east and the west, and 'socialist realism' took a lot of inspiration from Art Deco - both were optimistic art styles at heart

How come Denmark didnt wanna talk about jews
we have jews here, right
I think this is an odd survey: It asks about two different religions, the inhabitants of an entire continent and a colour which is not even a proper skincolour
What about all the Turkish, Iranian, Afghan and Kurdish immigrants in Europe
Most of them are muslim as well as asians
Would you feel comfortable if your child was in a relationship with a Swede
It's a surprise to most Danes that discrimination against Jews is still a thing in many western countries
Whereas Sweden, the UK, and France are like: "Please just marry my child
Yes, but middle Eastern muslims would be Asians, so they would be in another part of the survey
Iranians, Chinese, Lebanese, Indians, Thai, Vietnamese, Saudi Arabians and Afghanis are all Asians
A third of russians are also Asian
In what universe is Asian a race
Or Roma for that matter
Doo it
Doo it nau
I am sure you have
Loads of Danes has a Jewish background
They just don't have funny names like Morgenstern, Goldmesser or Krankenzimmer
Fuck you guys anyways
-Love,

The middle East is literally a region in Asia
Being middle Eastern implies being Asian
Asian is a word describing people from the continent of Asia, including Iranians, Afghanis, Indians, Chinese, Vietnamese and 25% of russians
Gypsy is more a lifestyle than an ethnic classification
That's exactly it
Religion just isn't seen as a topic of interest here so it just doesn't come up very often
I have no clue if I've met any Catholic or Baptist Danes either for the same reason
I might have but how would I ever know
> And yet, in many countries people who see the word Asian will think of the Far East rather than the near East
A lot of people in a lot of countries are uninformed then
Gypsies are many different kinds of people
In brittain many, if not most, gypsies are irish
Asians are people from asia
Asia is a landmass with defined boundaries
If people think otherwise then they are mistaken

We decided a while ago to stop caring about trees in Denmark i guess
"Oops"
\- Denmark
Ok, hands down, I thought Denmark had a lot of trees
This is most likely because the country is quite densely populated and a decently large portion of the forests have probably been cleared to make farmland
Weird coming from Silkeborg a city within a forest

Our EU 'representatives' are an embarrassment
The Danish EU politician Jens Rohde described opponents of the bills as "net communists". After concerned citizens started to write him emails, he classified them as "spam" and said he had been hacked
Anyway, I want a list of Danish politicians who voted in favour
As I understand it, any place/person using bits of online journalistic content must pay a fee
You would have to pay to be allowed to post it on Facebook, Facebook would have to pay for having the link there on your profile, etc
From [this] I think you are correct
Facebook would have to get a license from a news agency to be allowed to have links to that agency's site
And, as the consequences section of that site points out, if Facebook doesn't want to buy those licenses, we'll all end up seeing a lot less reputable news sources
Where NSDAP at tho
They didn't haha, Danish people in general just do not care anymore
There is barely anyone left who is pro-immigrant
Refreshing to see these statistics aren't using Norway's 2011 numbers anymore
Because of the Utøya-attack, Norway had a 2
2 murder rate in 2011
The year before and after had roughly one fourth that
These maps and charts have without fail used the 2011 numbers for many years
I'm surprised Iceland isn't lower
I agree with turkey not being European,  but there's alot of debate if it should be included or not,
TECHNICALLY it's both Asian and European, but technically is so many other countries and you have to draw the line somewhere, afaik this sub considers turkey a part of Europe, but I might be remembering wrong
Switzerland has much stricter gun laws than the US in regards to how you can purchase the guns and how to store them
But yes, there are other factors at play as well
But that doesn't mean guns are not an important factor
[Harvard has a research centre dedicated to the effects firearms has on society
I agree that it's geographically more in the middle East
> People understimate how deadly knives are
You just need to get a bit closer but once you are within reach
It still takes a lot more to kill with a knife than with a gun
You need to stab someone in a critical area, which can only really be done deliberately
Meanwhile, with guns it's just pulling a trigger and you roll the dice
> There are 3-4 people injured by guns for every killed one on average
No, this is incorrect
The figure is barely over 2 injuried for everyone killed, at least [in the US:]
> In 2013, there were 73,505 nonfatal firearm injuries (23
2 injuries per 100,000 people),[7][8] and 33,636 deaths due to "injury by firearms" (10
6 deaths per 100,000 people)
This was the first hit that popped up
How does this compare with knives
I found some [data on this from London:]
> A total of 938 knife injuries were identified from 127,191 attendances (0
77% of all visits) with a case fatality rate of 0
53%.
That's 200 injuries to every death
That makes guns almost 100 times more deadly than knives
So yes, firearms are deadlier than knives
Far deadlier
That doesn't mean you cannot kill with a knife, but it just takes more effort and you're likely to stop stabbing before you've killed your victim
That's not the case with guns
> You just need to stab randomly
Yeah, and if you do, you need to stab repeatedly
Which again, requires more effort than pulling a trigger
My point is that accidentally killing someone you shoot would be more common than accidentally killing someone you stab
Say two people become aggressive towards each other
In one scenario, they both pull a knife, while in the other, they both pull a gun
Where do you think there is the highest risk of death
> Just consider the size of ah average knife and of the average bullet
You do realize that gun shots cause the tissue to expand, right
> Im pretty sure a lot of gun shot wounds gets unreported
And this wouldn't be the case for knives, because
> On the other hand, there is a lot of ways you can get injured by a knife that doesnt involve violence
Accidental shootings happen as well
But yes, I'll grant you that accidental injury is more common with knives
> Also, most of those US gun deaths are suicides, the sad fact is that a suicide very likely to succeed if you use a gun
It's about 2:1 suicides to homicides
Even removing suicides would still leave us at about 6 injuries for every homicide by gun or accidental death by gun
> Have you actually ever shot a pistol
I've shot air guns at targets, and I've shot a hunting rifle
Yes, it's difficult to hit at range
But it's easier to hit at range than with a knife, obviously
> If you shoot or stab someone by accident, youve done something very, very wrong
No, I'm saying that it's easier to slash someone in the arms and then have one of the knife fighters flee the scene than shooting someone and having the other flee
> If hey both pull knives, chances are they both bleed to death before any help comes, unless one of them is much more skilled
No, I disagree
The body is quite resilient
I'd argue that one of them will be injured and flee unless the other part really wants to kill them
But in a knife fight, that's generally not the objective
The objective is to either defeat the other guy or defend yourself
Both objectives are achieved once the other guy is injured and doesn't want to fight anymore
Why
Because it's far more probable that you'll hit an arm than the neck or some other vital spot because the other guy will use his arm for protection and it will be closer to you
In a gun fight
You don't really have much say in whether you're shooting to kill or shooting to injure
There is far less control over this than with a knife, exactly because hitting precisely with a gun is far more difficult than with a knife
> Pistol rounds are mostly too slow to really cause hydrostatic shock
I'm not talking about hydrostatic shock
I'm talking about the kinds of wounds you see when you search for gun wound in google images
That kind of damage
Which is the reason why it's more difficult to treat and more lethal than stab wounds, as per what the UK surgeon said
> Bleeding is very dangerous and its not that hard to cut a major blood vessel with a long slash
But still less likely that to fatally shooting someone
Eslali
When Denmark voted for the Euro in 2002, 46,8% voted for and 53,2% against
I have a hard time believing how that number is now 28%.
You will never take the queen away from our currency
We have our own currency, kroner, which we can use at the German border
Yeah, especially since Europositivism is up recently
I'd wager that a campaign from SRFÅ+VK, DA and FH could get us to 45-55%, as these EU elections always seem to turn out
If economic trouble comes (again) and it becomes favorable to pursue a different interest policy than what the ECB have, then you just do it
Leaving the EU would be easier if that ever becomes an issue
As a non euro nation your country is not guarantying for the bond buying to support euro nations that struggle with high debt, unemployment and fiscal deficits
Especially the last one is critical
If Denmark had been a euro member and wanted to leave we would have gained an extra debt equivalent to something like 10 great belt bridges
Just getting the population to support constructing one was difficult, but 10 at the same time
What not say “gold”? It means literally gold isn’t it
I would hate it
There's so many small coins
They're completely useless
But we're moving away from physical currency anyway, so it won't have a major impact anyway
Can't recall the last time I paid with cash
Yeah but it is a voluntary peg that resulted in low interests in Denmark when the eurozone had its last crisis
Imo you should have both common monetary policy and fiscal policy but since it is not possible, you should have neither
The peg ensured Danish politicians did not devaluate the currency, but found a different way to regulate money flows
Our situation is not like Greece
It was more similar back in the early 1980's when we pegged the currency, but now we got a massive pension private pension savings, little to zero foreign currency issued debt, stable/balanced public finances and huge positive trade balances
It's less stable
In some situations that can be an advantage - if the Swedish economy does poorly, the krona can lose value, making Swedish exports more competitive and helping economic recovery
But there are disadvantages too, like typically paying higher interest on debt
We really cannot
We had 20% interest rates before pegging, and getting even close to that would completely kill the Danish economy, as well as ruin the private economies of hundreds of thousands of households because of how flexible interest rate loans work
We're already literally paying banks to loan money from our national bank to push down interest, so there's nothing to really push on on that front, and we're pegging _way_ closer than the ERMII requirements because we **need** the additional lower interest rates we can get by being even more identical to the Euro
The reality is that even a looser peg is a complete no-go at this point
We do have the Euro in practice and the cost of changing that is so unimaginably high that it can realistically never be the best option
We just give up our potential Euro voting rights to feel good about having different bill designs
Not really
The USA have kind of the same problem
States with weak economies suffer from being in a union together with states with strong economies
Its an old friend we have gotten so used to we forget to address the issue of its existence
All Danish government debt is issued in Danish currency, and the trillions of pension kroners invested abroad ensures foreign currency is flowing to the central bank even if there was not a huge trade surplus
Scrapping the peg is no longer such a frightening thing, and considering Norway and Sweden free floats its currency, Denmark could do the same
Probably will not do it, for the simple reason that as long as we have the peg, the politicians can not mess with the currency
Yes
Print currency which will devaluate the currency and cause moderate inflation
This can be a good thing if needed
Maybe not for Denmark, but certainly could have been for Greece
I'm one of the 28% who disagree with that
We should be part of the euro imo
> To make new factories, Greece will need to import German machinery which will be relatively more expensive
The major export industry in Greece is tourism
That doesn't require German machinery
Chinese machinery competes very successfully recently
Printing industry for example, long years on German machines but Chinese are taking over, it will be the same elsewhere
Inflation can be caused by many things, not just printing money (as inflation is just the price-index of goods and services)
Unemployment skyrocketed after the crisis, especially in Greece
Having control of their own currency could have mitigated a large part of this
The inflation percentage is not the single number that is important
That only works for dealing with the natural fluctuations that come with recessions
The Greece Debt Crisis is fundamentally different, in that it is caused by structurally flawed financial management (which was covered up by the government), which means that structural economic management changes are what's needed
The West found this out the hard way back in the 70’s and 80’s, where the 1973 oil crisis caused spending to be unreasonably high, but this was approached as a recession
The issue wasn’t fixed, but the West now had both a debt crisis and an interest crisis (banks were charging 20-25% additional interest because of fears of government devaluation) along with it
This later caused the rise of Neoliberalist economic management, which dictated that a stable currency was priority number 1, as well as many decisions that really hurt, as it turned out that solving the interest rate crisis and spending crisis were the first steps to get back on track
The issue with dealing with structural economic mismanagement at a late stage is that there’s no way to deal with it that doesn’t hurt a lot
Convenience, higher influence on EU monetary policies, and showing support for the EU project
A national export is work your citizens do, which foreign citizens pay for
For example a Greek worker makes a car, a German buys it in Germany, so you made money by exporting it
Tourism is an export by the same reasoning
For example your restaurant make a meal, a German pays for it
You just transferred German money to the Greek economy
The fact that the German person is in Greece the moment he pays of the work of the Greek worker is immaterial for whether the work functions as an export
Infinitely more than 0 people
Not to mention that the decision made are directed by the EC and EUCO where each memberstate has a single representative
Small nations have greater proportional representation everywhere in the EU
I feel like the weather has forgotten that the nordic and baltic countries are a part of europe

The Mediterranean sea water is warmer than Scandinavia
We're chillin'.
Seriously - we've had like *one* week of 25°+ weather, all other weeks being these grey and cloudy 18° days
I love Spain's "I'm *so* tired of this shit
" expression
Thought that was agar
io for a sec
That's really smart
Definetely like the style of the map, though I find it a bit barren of cities, it makes Europe look like a desert landscape
Though I can see you mostly did the capital thing since borders don't show on the map it makes it look a bit weird is all, what with it not being entirely consistent (Some countries get more than one city, some don't, some don't get a city at all
Nice try, but whoever drew this forgot about [The Mountain of Heaven] in Denmark while making the topography
Love the style, can't help but be reminded of the intro to Game of Thrones
Kjolen means "The dress" in danish
I like that there's no apparent national borders and only some text legend, it gives it a more exploratory feel (If that makes sense
But yay, larger cities
Don't apologize, the map is absolutely great the way it is
So what if some forrest in Poland isn't on it, jeez
And I don't really see how any key cities are missing, isn't every European capital represented
Edit: Maybe I'm just tired, but I couldn't find Prague
Don't beat yourself up about it, map is still wonderful
That's more like it
Also, quite funny that I as a dane is pointing out that Prague was missing
Young danes are quite infamous in the Czech capital for being an obnoxious bunch of drunken assholes
And soon afterwards Latvia and Lithuania as well
Crazy how these small countries tries to overtake a giant nation like Russia
Tiny imperialist countries, sure got what they deserved

Ussually when there is fuss in denmark, farmers are clogging the freeways during rush hours and parking them outside the parlament
Yeah they don’t want 20 kids and they don’t want condoms
Can’t pull a man off his high tractor though
That is so beautiful, we have something similar in Denmark on this day but not quite as impressive
4th of may is our liberation day, too
We set a candle in our window during the evening, to show respect and remember the fallen soldiers who helped gain our freedom and liberation from the germans
Same in Denmark
The tradition of the candles on the evening of the 4th is that the BBC broadcast to Denmark in the evening of 4 may 1945 revealed that Germany had surrendered
People took down the blackout curtains that had been there for 5 years and went into the streets to celebrate
The tradition started soon efter that every year on  the 4th
Ah thank you, it is actually the same here in Denmark too, I just got it mixed up
The 4th is remembering the soliders who fell, the 5th is the actual liberation day
Thanks for correcting that
I believe several European countries have the same dates for these events, since the Germans retreated at around the same time
We were liberated late on the 4th, the radio announced this at 20:36 in the evening
And so the 5th became the actual liberation day, where everyone woke up to a war that had finally ended
Coming from the *other* bicycle-obsessed country, I'm proud of you, Germany
This world needs more cyclists
How many of them are broken or abandoned
i see a lot of broken bikes that are never moved
We have 25c for almost 2 weeks now, here in Denmark, this is already the year with most qualified summerdays in years, I have no idea how to handle this and I'm expecting the rest of the year to be rainy any day now
yup i feel you - Denmark
Having to work in an office when it's around 25 degrees is not fun
Ideally it would be around 15-18 in the summer, and if i want it hotter i will travel to it
Then again i'm a vinter person
Hunter S. Thompson said his blood was too thick for Nevada's desert climate
Want to swap
I would love some 8 degrees and rain here
It's the moisture and sun
Especially the sun
Fuck that bastard
I need some clouds here to not look like a wet lobster
25 degrees of clear skyes
You joke about it \(and so do we\), but it's been fairly warm these last few years

For all the bad the Nazi's did, they sure looked good doing it
I hope you were you able to do it faster than the Belgians were with their Palace de Justice in Brussels
When we moved to Brussels in the mid-90's I remember the scaffolding being on the building, I don't remember ever having seen the building without it, and apparently they [won't be done be done before 2028] Apparently budget cuts to the cleaning have been so bad that the old scaffolding literally rusted to the building, forcing them to start over
My favourite example of how bad planning in Brussels can be was from the road in front of one of my classmate's house, within two years they tore up and repaved their road three times; once to lay down new gas lines, another to lay down new electricity lines and a third to put down new water pipes, while each time took months to do the job

YOOO THAT EPISODE IS A CLASSIC
I remember this scene
Its when they are in the caravan thats driving down the cliff side

So after half a year i finally finished the project
Thank you all so much for the help and motivation, i could not have done it without you
The final product has been upscaled to 4K resolution, so you can print it and hang it as a poster
There is also a watermark to prevent people from claiming it as theirs

Thank you all so much once again and have a nice day
Pretty fucking amazing
Havde sgu ikke forventet jeg jeg skulle se et af dine post da jeg åbnede Reddit
I absolutely love that you included the oil rig Sealand
Nice

Ha, it's a funny story actually
In Danish, kage means cake, and I had an inside joke about kage with my friends
When I made my original reddit account in 2018, it was a parody of kage, the long dead cookie clicker and the postal code at the end as litteraly everyone had it in their gamer tags for some reason
Kageclicker2630, it was
Then I forgot the password, made a new one on my phone, got more karma on the alt and eventually made it my main account
Thanks

Can we get some deals that involve getting licenses for loads of anime
I'm tired of having to pirate shows
Oh wow, I think I read this headline last week as well
And the week before that
It's apparently becoming quite often that Japan and the EU sign free trade deals
North Korea doesn't trade with anyone, and they've got nuclear arms
Japan trades with all of the world and they have no nuclear weapons
WAKE UP PEOPLE
What /u/TheFischkopp said
Japan and the EU are moving closer in a time where USA is actively trying to distance itself from everyone, which is fucking dangerous in the long run
CR just acts as a "netflix" for Anime, still need country-specific licenses
mostly things are just licensed to America and not Europe

Are you celebrating Independence from Austro-Hungarian Empire or Slovakia
Czech-out
Didn't realize Czech republic have the best possible EU-Exit name
- Congratulations on your independence day :)
> Look at how completely dominant EU imports and exports to the EU are in our trade
Now consider there are idiots in this country who would want a Czech-out
To be fair, just because you're not part of the EU, doesn't mean you can no longer import or export EU goods, or that it would necessarily become more expensive for you to do so
Czechxit could work too
It's like that for all people in any of the memberstates
EU is such a great thing, but those against it only pick those places that could be better instead of all the great things that EU does
Some people are just blind
I don't like that it's not whole numbers

usually read one/or some of it before going to sleep :)
They were popular in Denmark too, at least back when kids stil read comics in the 80's and 90's.
I don't know if they are still as popular as they were back then, now kids plays games on tablets instead

Completely misunderstanding the point
Someone on r Overwatch made a thread of "Fuck you Blizzard" over losing 74 SR points when he got disconnected from a comp match without warning as Blizzard updated their policy
What a fucking braindead moron
Just ask them
They have a few days to comply
Which is understandable really
> This is the approach for companies that heard about the GDPR 2 yearsago, said "its plenty of time left" and yesterday went like "what do you mean it is tomorrow
Not even that
There is way too much business in it that youd go " what do you mean its tomorrow - fuck its lets stop giving them access instead of complying" just because its suddenly the time runs short
They just stored and sold shitton of data and made it their actual main business
Otherwise there is no way theyd get so much damage from GDPR that theyd feel the need to do that
Kinda
I'm guessing that if they don't reside in the EU, and don't really do business in the EU, then you'd have a hard time dragging them into an EU court
Maybe
Just like I'm pretty sure that I won't end up in a Chinese court due to my (theoretically) internationally available website
Recital 23 of the GDPR "...In order to determine whether such a controller or processor is offering goods or services to data subjects who are in the Union, it should be ascertained whether it is apparent that the controller or processor envisages offering services to data subjects in one or more Member States in the Union
This is pretty much how jurisdiction has worked as it concerns consumer law within the EU
But now being extended to data protection
It basically means that if the company attempts or has the appearance of selling to EU citizens, then they need to be compliant with the GDPR
So maybe they would not have to comply with EU law, in the case where they are not targeted towards EU citizens
Some things like having a significant amount of EU customers would suffice as proof of being under GDPR
But does the EU toss out Brexiteers with steam or digital
Bet she envies the dead

Stay strong and democratic Germany
Finally the actual leaders are in the lead, so can we get shit done before we have to pretend that everyone gets a say again
FREUDE
But please, do keep on giving us money though
We need to get Hungary, Poland and Cypern out of the EU
And welcome them back when they fullfill the requirements regarding democracy and rule of law
No Cuba
Yes we are Socialist hellhole
Please stay away for your own good Americans

If that dosn't scream dumb i don't know what does
North Korea
What kind of public health are does China and Russia have ? - I bet it’s far less “socialistic” than most of Western Europe
I wish I lived in the world 36% of Americans seem to think we do
fuckin' commies
honestly, that's actually far better than I'd expected -- this means that over half of the burger boys have at least a basic understanding of socialism
Even if we accept your mockery of Americans, and we assume they do define socialism wrong, they still have the right idea about the real battle being between state coersion vs individualism
Socialism/communism is basically a bogeyman at this point
Everything you dont like is socialism
Half the people in this thread has no idea what socialism is
It's not like Russia was socialist 30 years ago either
If the list is pre-given, the headline is streching the truth
Just like he did when he was alive
Well it is the daily mail

Europe has overall smaller cars with better fuel economy and different suspension because the governments of Europe tax fuel and cars more and the roads are generally better
The old cities of Europe also have smaller roads
Don't worry
Our politicians are very well aware that Donald Trump is doing his own thing
It all depends on how the rest of the country behaves, whether it has an influence on future relationships
And you know like fucking Linux
European cars are becoming increasingly automatic as well, party because of rising demand for automatics in Europe and decreasing costs
And that's a good thing, because here in Europe we produce great automatics, just look at the DSG

Is this a real ad
it's a "typo". Probably deliberate
Schuss means shot
Title is misleading
What the Danish political party says is that if wants the EU to use sanctions against countries enforcing a trade embarco against French products
So it has nothing to do with private citizens in foreign countries deciding to not buy French products
It is a tool to use if the leaders (dictators) of a nation declares a trade embarco against France

The Danish (and probably also others) way: If salmonella is detected in a chicken farm, ~~AOL~~ all of the chickens are destroyed
Result: Danish chickens are considered salmonella free and therefore there is no warning against using raw eggs in food for people who are in normal health
We do refrigerate our eggs, but I think that's just to keep them fresh longer and/or is just how it has always been
Why isn't he asking the real question
Like, why does all stores put a rubberband around my carton of eggs
so do we have no salmonella or do we have "no salmonella"?
I chose a dvd for tonight
I must have an AOL CD ROM somewhere
I heard they were everywhere
We just like to play it safe
In the link our experts basically says that all things kept cold will stay fresh longer therefore it is better to keep the eggs in the fridge
regardless of what everybody else does
They are kept in the fridge in the shops too
Both, we dont, untill someone find some
Iirc we have more salmonella in pigs than chickens
You can get eggs from other places than Denmark
It might have been true once, but not today
Just my guess
The department for food, fishing and agriculture first pulled their warning against eating raw eggs in 2013 (and I am pretty sure they pulled back a couple of laws about companies serving food with raw egg just last year) so year pretty recent development
So it's clearly Sweden who are the weirdos in this scenario
Glad we got that settled

It seems that it actually is for a stretch leading up to the red-painted bit
I was more referring to the fact that it seems that bikes have to cross a bus/turn lane to get to the bike-exclusive red lane
Those are a recipe for disaster
There are a couple in Copenhagen too, but they are all regulated with traffic lights (with the exception of one that I can think of)
Once the red bit starts, it looks decent since it has a curb
Is it far from Santiago de Compostela
Is it just me or is this a bad map/legend
There is no indication of what a place is
You could call Europe a place and colour it all yellow
I doubt  Schleswig-Holstein  is that spread out
I think the data from Denmark is incorrect or old
There are lot of towns i cannot find that I know for a fact has +1000 inhabitants
Is that because there is a difference in population density or difference in what constitutes a place, I wonder
Well it kinda is I guess
SH data probably shows municipalities > 1000 inhabitants, where the Danish data shows towns > 1000 inhabitants
In that way you would get a lot of rural localities with more than 1000 inhabitants
WTF
We did *not* ship all our best bacon and butter to you for the past 150 years just to come in seventh
Goddamn ingrates
I think *Neutral* (possibly combined with *Not heard of it*) creates an indication of noteworthiness, how much the Brits care about that country - a low rating means they care a lot
While the relationship between positive and negative then indicate how well they like that country
The NET Pos-Neg indication is also quite close to this
Naturally the UK would then be the most noteworthy country, but followed by Ireland as the 2nd most noteworthy country
In all of these lists whether they're important or not, i always look at whether or not we've beaten Sweden
You win this time you sunuvabitch
as a dane part norweigen and swede i am insulted that portugal isn't higher like does the longest alliance in the world not mean anything to you
That's not how I interpret "not heard of", but as what has that country done recently and people would not know as they "haven't heard anything", it doesn't mean whether or not the country exists
nobody knows what Estonia is
Of course you are, look, Denmark is right there
Yes well, you've kind of ruined that reputation a bit lately
You can't be sure that that is how it is to be understood
It is much more likely they haven't heard anything new or from that country, so they can't place themselves in either positive, negative or neutral
Not for me
Paid rioters
Is this the Soros thing i've been hearing about
Oh my god, you're making me blush
Isn't there also a group of countries including scandinavia and a few countries to the right of sweden
That really depends on what people in their minds put in front or after the sentence "haven't heard of".
, "I haven't heard of anything recent that would change my view on country1 one way or the other".
Besides these questionnaires are often done by phone, so it isn't the person who answers who put down their own answers but someone else
Thanks
Yeah, it's them, I seached scandinavia and baltic and the word I was looking for was baltoscandia, aparently
No idea why they're grouped together, I just remembered that there was a name for it
Also, sorry, I forgot there wasn't a map in the photo
I wouldn't. I would settle down somewhere in Scandinavia where the weather isn't too hot and unbearable
[I recorded a gif of the fisting incident after seeing the video on a danish news site

Øbåmæ
Øøh, politimand is the default word for a cop here in Denmark, so I'd consider the direct translation, policeman, to be apt given the context
Calling a danish policeman a cop, would be the equivalent of calling him a strømer, strisser or panser
I don't really know if we have a proper direct translation of police officer though
Politi officer

"semi drunk Swedes"?
- Just say "Swedes", it's faster and we all know that's how it is
Men det gjorde de ikke
Roughly the same as "båtnakker", "vatnisser" or "skidesprællere".
Ass bananas
godnat og sov godt
You moved to Randers, ikk’?
I'll give it a go, but these are not particilarly easy to translate directly
"Båtnakker" - "båt" is more of a sound than an actual word
When we press the horn of a car we'd call the sound a "båt" (or more often a "dyt")
"Nakker" in this context means "necks" often referring to the back part of the neck
"Vatnisser" is more simple
"Vat" is cotton wool (those small puffy balls of cotton used to clean stuff), while nisser is the Danish words for elves (or sometimes pixies) - the small creatures that help Santa Claus
"Skidesprællere" is tougher, though
"At skide" means to shit and "at sprælle" means to wiggle or to writhe
So something like "shit wriggler". I don't know the origin of the word, but maybe someone who wriggles in shit
I'm sure someone can provide some better examples, but I hope this gives a (very) rough idea
If we are to be kind, maaaaybe B1: "Can produce simple connected text on topics that are familiar or of personal interest
It's just something people call it other as a silly insult
"You are an ass-banana". There's not a specific scenario where it makes sense to use it
I have never heard the word "buttneck" before, but that would make sense
Turns out Portugese and Australian has more in common than I first would've imagined

I don't like it, anything above 18 is horrible when you have to work at the office
This heat makes me want to drive off a cliff
Unfortunately the nearest cliff is on the other side of the country, and no way in hell am I driving all the way over there in this heat
Please take it back
It's far too hot, and summer has only started
KILL MEEE
What i wouldn’t do to be in austria
Damn
Denmark is as hot as Egypt
Bruh we moved to a new classrom in my school and its 30 degrees celsius, no air conitioners, but we do have windows but we have some of the most annyoing girls in our class that keeps closing them because they think its cold or something
Yea fuck you mathilde, you karen
I love summer
Could be altitude difference
Lots of mountains up there
Yup, same here
I'm from 1980 and I remember a few of those "Crazy heat" summers because they actually stood out
Then again, I also remember building snowmen, snow caves in drifts etc
That sure as shit hasn't been possible for quite a while now
Fuck no
Spring > Autumn > > > Summer > Winter
Can you please call it "efterår", not autumn
Autumn is for Anglos because they can't say efterår
It's warmer in Finland, so you're already dead then
Same here, unfortunately we barely even have winters anymore it seems
I remember building big snowmen, caves in snow drifts etc
as a child but that sure as shit hasn't been possible for years now
I'm just not built for 25+ degrees, I'll often sit at the PC with my feet in a bucket of ice water just to cope
Exactly
It almost feels like the air is some semi-liquid thing when it's humid and hot
Just breathing feels weird
I've never had the same problem when I've been in Portugal, Greece etc
Obviously it's even warmer down there but it's a dry heat so you're "just" roasting
You can still breathe and it's not nearly as "sticky".
I can follow that as well
That was my opinion until I got a garden
There's just something lovely about Autumn
99% sounds about right
The last 1% can not read or write
English is what the comment thread mentions, but many Danes knows some or a lot of German, French, Spanish
There is 500000 foreign workers in Denmark presumably speaking a different language plus maybe Danish
Many speak or understand Swedish and Norwegian quite well (or not at all according to complainers)
The key issue here is people being asked if they can read, write and understand a second language
Norwegian is a second language, and the written Norwegian and Danish is practically the same
Surprising that my country's top of the list
Guess that's how things are
People from Malta speak English and Italian
or what is the second language
HVOR ER SVENSKEN

KOM SÅ DANMARK, KOM SÅ
Denmark big, Denmark stronk, Denmark overconfident in his abilities
I can't help but imagine Denmarks statistic might've been helped by Faroe Islands and Greenland who have mandatory Danish and English on top of their native Faroese and Inuit
I'm so glad i live in Denmark and not germany
Having been on vacation in germany / austria all their synchronized televsion is a nightmare
It's awesome being bilingual (semi trilingual)
English or French I guess
In Denmark it is english
I was surprised to find out that today english is mandatory from the first grade of elementary school (I believe it was 4th grade in my time)
French or german becomes mandatory in 5th grade
It is also possible to select spanish as an elective (or have both french and german where one is an elective), or other languages if the school offers it
>instead of words like ATM they use words like Bank Machine(translating Estonian word into English)
That's because English unlike most other languages likes to use words that doesn't describe e.g. the item well
In Denmark it is English followed by French and/or German
At least back when I was in school, it was up to the student what dialect of English they wanted to go with; British, American, etc, as long as it was consistent
That consistency could be a problem when you were learning British english in class, but picking up American english vocabulary from tv
In denmark its (from what i know) english, followed by german, french, spanish and chinese
English and one of those other languages are mandetory in ground school
Pretty much this
Most of Danish kids learn German in school (some learn French or Spanish instead), and last time we were in Berlin on vacation my daughter stated that "Germany is a lot nicer when you realize that you don't *actually* have to speak German
Just find a person under 30, and they'll happily speak English
I doubt 30% of their population are immigrants so obviously somebody was lying
Mind geblown
To expand on the other comments, from this sentence on wikipedia it sounds like locks would have used too much water during summer to be an option:
>The planned canal bridge over the Elbe, necessary to avoid low water conditions in summer, was not built due to the Second World War
What's up with France
How reliable is this information
Is this among the entire population or only among the bourgeois
Just one of the many reasons for why the Russian revolution happened
RemindMe
7 years
Yeah
You know people, that cliff exists because the water eats the rock at the bottom
And the the rock on top of the missing rock falls down, leaving a sheer cliff
Which means that the ground at the edge at the top of the cliff is not expected to stay where it is
So building on the edge is a VERY BAD IDEA
Haven't had a "robocall" before (From Denmark), but I do get loads of calls from various call-centers
Luckily enough, there only really seems to be 2-3 numbers calling me from time to time, so they just get added to my list of blocked numbers
...and they sure as hell don't give a fuck about the calling hours
The last one I picked up (maybe a year ago, I think), was at around 23:00
I've had some a few years back, that called earlier than the listed time on that chart as well
Edit: Just looked through my blocked call - last one I received was actually yesterday (so on a Sunday) :/
For most people sure, but some people dont see well, so it being a call is a nice option
Thats why its a nice option, as in you dont have to, but you can
It is forecast for 40 this week in the UK

I am visiting France - can confirm, it’s hot at shit at the very moment
Thanks but no thanks
Yeeeah this is one list I'm cool ^^^^heh with being near the bottom of
Scandinavia not topping a list, this must be an error in the measurements
Right
It's 28° here in Copenhagen and I feel like I'm melting
I'm pretty sure anything above 40° would literally kill me
Countries like Iceland, Denmark, Norway, Ireland and UK will probably never reach 40 degrees, there's simply to much coastline to cool the air
Same reason why places located at Northern Africas tip never really gets "that hot", the Mediterranean Sea cools it down
Now theres another problem with climate change
As more ice melts the currents might change
Now if the Gulf Stream changes or worse, ceases to exist, we might see another Ice age
Then Iceland will actually be a land of Ice
It's scary how many of these records are from year 2000 and after

Long Live United Deutschland ! Greetings from Denmark
Last year my girlfriend and I went to Hungary, Slovakia, Austria, the Czezh Republic and Germany for a few weeks and it was definitely way cheaper to just hop on buses (we used Flixbus and RegioJet) instead of getting an Interrail Pass
Unless you go around eastern Europe
Interrail is quite good from Prague and onwards IMO
Interrail works for all trains *except* in your own country
It does entitle you to a reduced fare in your own country, though
Night trains and high-speed trains usually have mandatory seat reservations, which must be paid on top of the normal price
For most countries, the seat reservations on high-speed trains are somewhere between 10 and 30 €. However, all high-speed ICE trains in Germany do not require seat reservations (unless they are cross-border services to France) and all Railjet services in Austria and the surrounding countries also do not require reservations (unless they cross the border to Hungary)
Also, the Eurostar is not included *at all* in the Interrail pass
It is sometimes cheaper to take a flight across the channel rather than a train
These old fucks will soon die off and maybe we'll see England come back to sensible hands
And soon as they’re actually leaving “hey we’re bringing them back
Wait, what do they *want* you to book with then
Mailing them a bag of coins
The EU expansion and the speed of it were British positions/decisions though
1) the UK always pushed for expanding the EU faster, this decision was made at EU level, but with the UK being the most influential strong supporter
2) Within the EU agreement it was possible to limit the number of immigrants from new countries for a number of years
The UK made an entirely sovereign decision not to do this (unlike many other countries such as my own)
Swedes just have to ruin everything good

When dealing with skewed distributions, the median will sometimes be a better measure as it ignores e.g. the billionaires - people I assume you didn’t mean to compare yourself to
I am glad that you have finally come to accept our rightful possession of Norway and calculate our income as one

Denmark has declared bankrupcy
OP made a follow up comment saying it was 3270, which isn't bad at all
T R I G G E R E D
Does it matter
As long as there is data for Sweden and Germany the Danes will shuffle along on the same track or on the nearby trail higher up while thinking life is good but could Always be better (if you were a complaining Dane that wasted time on such a strange thinking)
Uhm
Okay, could you rephrase that somehow
Danes will complain about anything while at the same time keep saying they think life is good
Since we share roughly the same political ideology management of Sweden and our currency is pegged to the largest trading partner (Euro now, but the peg was to the Deutsche Mark belonging to Germany and we still worship at the German alter of austerity and close watch on the economy
My point is Denmark will be in the income neighborhood of Sweden and the economic performance of Germany
No need to know or guess the exact number, just know it is the ball park of the other two nations
Oh sweet summer child
You don't know how bad Greece has shit the bed
Sounds reasonable
Would be nice to know however, especially since it has a different color than Sweden and Germany
Price level is higher in Denmark, so what you can buy for that wage difference between Denmark and Sweden is tiny
Also, "kerfufle". Holy shit man, where'd you even find that word
You clearly didn't pay close enough attention if you think that they are better off than Lithuania
Lithuania is slowly gaining ground as far as I've heard, investing in IT sector growth and whatnot
It's a shame that your politicians think that they can control the bleeding of highly qualified workers by making punitive laws against emigration, but you're still far off Greece levels of being royally fucked
Greece currently exists at the mercy of other countries
This may all be well and true, and thanks for the explanation, but it doesn't make it any less of an error :)
No, what you’ve seen is tourist areas in a warm country with wealthy foreigners buying property
You can see the same shit all along the southern part of Europe, that doesn’t make those countries rich
Also, anecdotes aren’t exactly a strong comeback to facts and figures
Again, which millionaires are moving to Lithuania
Also, if you go to the outskirts of Lithuania you can find a fair share of drunkards who make virtually no money, but that’s mostly leftovers of a post-occupation fallout
Greece’s economy is thoroughly fucked all throughout the whole country
Their government is on the verge of a collapse
There’s plenty of high skilled workers fleeing the country because of jobs disappearing
Also, yeah, I see the irony of this being unsupported claims, but I am too busy to back this up at the moment
Furthermore
“itinerary”?
Shit, I’m gonna need a thesaurus
The implication of the first part was that Greece's numbers are inflated by the amount of people moving their businesses there exclusively to enjoy the weather
This accounts for a large portion of Spain's alleged income, for example
As for Greece recovering, I am skeptical, but can't prove shit
As for the rest
Fuck me, you're probably right
Part of me just really wants to believe that Lithuania will crawl back into a nicer spot once the post-occupation PTSD workforce retreats into pension
Also, my impression is that Lithuanian residents move out of the luxury of wanting a higher pay for the same jobs, rather than actually having to, due to jobmarkets collapsing there
I could be wrong, though
I think Lithuania will be fine once the newer generations start to establish businesses and spurring real growth in the country, but it's a matter of time

How horribly we treated Germans after WW2
This is a subject we aren't being taught about in school since we trying to let it slide past as something that happened but doesn't happen anymore (which is true though)
Edit: It's not like we don't get to know about it, but there aren't dedicated lessons about it in history class
I guess colonization is a dark time for many countries, in Denmark is was no different, but often you talk about the islands is the Caribbean or Africa, but the treatment of Greenlandic people has been absolutely horrible in Denmark
They have been treated 2
rank citizens, and everything was dictated from Denmark and they had little to no say in it
Still I have heard that higher education in Greenland is taught in Danish not Greenlandic, but they might have changed that
Denmark was probably the clear frontrunner when it came to lobotomies
Between 1951 and 1984 4
500 lobotomies were performed on developmentally challenged and "morally deficient" men, women **and** children all the way down to 6 year olds
The number 4
500 needs to be considered in the context that in total population of Denmark in '51 was 4,3 mio
and in '84 it was 5,1 mio
During those 33 years the state lobotomized roughly every 1000th citizen
Denmark passed a law in 1985 that was supposed to ban the use of corporal punishment, so parents could no longer legally beat their children, but it was worded so vaguely that it was in dispute if parents were only obliged to keep others from using corporal punishment against their children or if they had to keep their children safe from all violence, even their own
Sadly it had to take a whole 14 years before finally in 1997 it was clarified to clearly state that parents may not hurt their children
Even then there were several political parties that were against this change
our right wing populist party was created out of an openly racists party in the 1970's and since 2001 they have been in a coalition with the rest of the centre-right parties and forced extreme immigration laws and normalized racists rhetoric before most other european nations, our social-democratic party is now in power through a coalition, but not changing those laws because they fear backlash and only the far leftwing is directly trying to change the laws, but wont challenge the social-democrats leadership on this issue
an example; You arn't automatically a Danish citizen even if you are born here to none danish parents, and becomming a citizen is extermly hard for none EU citizens
There are people when spoken about in the media is called "2ed or 3rd generation immigrants" - hence they were born and raised here, only went to danish schools, but could get deported any time
And our system dosn't regard marriage or having children with an immigrant as reason for that person not to be deported
Our asylum seeking and refugee laws have been challanged by the EU court of human rights, since we can deport anyone so long as there isn't an active war in their local home region of their nation of origin
Denmark was the fourth biggest slave traders in the 1700’s and after WW2 we forced german POW to clean up our beaches from mines and most of them were 15-16 years
I once made the mistake of listening to the BBC radio doc [Ireland’s Forced Labour Survivors] on my way to work, and I was openly weeping when I arrived
The lack of culpability or even (seemingly) remorse from the people and institutions responsible is just so infuriating
same here in Denmark with the greenlandic inuits
I my history classes we were taught about this
Guess it is up to the teachers
Damn, Latvians striked me as some of the most anti-communist people around
What is the reason for this
I know that during the Russian empire, the defenders of Ukrainian cultural rights and such were in large part some of kind of left-wing/communist opposition, is it part of a legacy of that for Latvians as well
It really is
In my years of public school, most of the history lessons was spend on ww1 and 1864
Which was way too much
We saw the movie "under sandet" in history class however a surprising number of my classmates actually thought it was okay to force Germans to clear mines in Denmark
That was further back in the past and doesn't have the same impact
There were no need to have rage against Germans that weren't supporting the nazi regime
And there are still people alive today who remember that time
Not to my knowledge, I was quite surprised when I was quite surprised when I learned about it a few years ago
Could you expand on that argument, please
I read through the story you linked, and couldn't really find anything related to your statement
Alright, thanks a lot for the detailed answer
yeah, they died by accident when the leadership mismanaged a sickness outbreak and some food rations where diverted or lost, as I remember it
No need to be sorry
Our king was a dumbass to go to war anyway
Ah, I was wondering why you were thinking we would be forcefully sterilizing immigrants
I'll take the liberty to split you your comment to hopefully give some insight in the right context
>Basically, the argument that immigrants are forced to give up their children to learn Danish values, religious holidays, language, and tradition, that isn't required for children who don't live in low income neighborhoods
This is true, and is still an issue that is being debated hotly
The arguments for this is, that children of non-western immigrants often integrate poorly into Danish society, and integration is key to maintaining the welfare state
Withholding welfare payments makes sense, since those payments requires the receiver (the parent) to be available and ready to take a job - which is impossible with small kids at home
Some Danish parents also chose to keep their kids at home, and forego the payments
The arguments against, is personal freedom to keep your kids at home, and still be able to live decently even though you're (relatively) new in the country
>(according to the article, the Danish government is forcing a lot of immigrants to live in the ghetto)
Not true
It's true that refugees are "placed" in different municipalities
(This is done to share the economical burden of receiving refugees equally between all municipalities)
The receiving municipality has a duty to assign refugees a permanent home, but this home can not be in a ghetto (or in an "fragile/exposed housing zone")
If the refugees are able to find other housing at the same cost within the municipality, they're free to do so
([source in Danish]
>and can be argued as destroying the family's original culture and religion to make them into "proper Danes"
The intent of coercing the children into regular daycare (along with pretty much every other kid in Denmark) is absolutely not to deny a family their culture or religion, but to teach the kids about the society will be growing up in
We have freedom of - and from - religion (I'm not Christian), but Denmark is a Christian nation per design, so we'll just have to accept that a lot of things happen, that are based in Christianity, and that's why it's important to teach the kids about it
I feel it's important to note that we're not talking about special kindergartens, but something that 91% of kids between 1-2 years old attends (rising to 97% for 3-5 years olds) I suppose I could link a few articles about the daily life in kindergartens, but I might come off as cherry picking, so I'll let you search for such stories yourself
>And there's the politician who wanted electronic ankle bracelets on children who live in the ghettos, but not other children, which would disproportionally affect Danish children born to immigrants
Yeah, we have idiot politicians here too
One drawback with a democracy where gaining 2% of the vote will get your party a number of seats in parliament is that we usually have a lot of MPs with "alternative" opinions
So, is everything in your original story false
Not at all, but it's important to understand that the essence of living in Denmark is that you need to help the country if you want to country to help you
You're absolutely free to keep your kids at home and teach them whatever you chose, but don't expect society to pay you for it
As a comparison, society will help you if you're jobless, but it's a requirement that you're actively seeking employment
Finally, maybe using the word "Ghetto" as a nomination for certain areas are not entirely politically correct, but any notion of those areas referring to Poland in WW2 is utter nonsense
[Here's the official definition on how to designate "Ghetto areas"]
My (poor) translation/rewrite:
An area is a ghetto if the following is true
- an area has more than 1000 inhabitants
- The amount of immigrants and descendants of immigrants from non-western countries is above 50%
and if any two of the following statements are true
- The amount of inhabitants aged 18-64, who is not employed or signed up for an education, is above 40%. Counted as an average over the last two years
- The amount of inhabitants who have received judgements against them for violating the law regarding violence, weapons, or drugs, is at least three times larger than the national average
Counted as an average over the last two years
- The amount of inhabitants aged 30-59, who have only primary schooling, is at least 60% of all inhabitants in that age group
- The average income for people aged 15-64 in the area (not including people signed up for education) is less than 55% of the average income for the same group in that region
(A "region" is simply put a "super municipality" with ~1 mill
people)
Scandinavism is in no way dead, we're still united in hating Sweden
>problems arise when you compare immigration proaccesses in our tiny nation with nations founded on it or old European empires who had subjects from all over the world with our small nations with a very complex language, nearly ethnically homogeneous nation where there are deep rooted cultural norms which are completely different from others cultures
>One thing is that our right-wing populist and anti-immigrant party has been in coalition governments with the rest of the centre-right parties since 2001, so they have had a very large influence on how asylum seekers, refugees and immigrants are talked about in the media and are constantly pushing the racism laws on whats acceptable and with their and other right-wing anti-immigrant parties growth, the centre parties and social-democrats havn't fought back fearing backlash in the elections, against "harsher laws", making it possible to deport refugees to war zones, putting whole families where one is a criminal into "camps" etc,
It's a loving hate
I know for a fact, that Danes hate Swedes because of our centuries old rivalry
I'd guess Norwegians do too, because of them being under Denmark during the rivalry, or maybe something to do with Swedes working in Norway

What was a “bruh moment” in your country’s history
For Denmark, I’d say it was when Danish politicians and Norwegian politicians discussed the oil resources in the Nordic sea
Our foreign affair minister, Per Hækkerup, got drunk and then basically gave Norway all of it
> Our foreign affair minister, Per Hækkerup, got drunk and then basically gave Norway all of it
Which is a myth of course
But Denmark did miss out on the oil though:
"In 1965, the current prime minister of Denmark signed the final agreement to divide the North Sea between Norway and Denmark according to the median line, causing Denmark to miss out on the huge and valuable field Ekofisk
When the Germans invaded Denmark during WWII, blasted through my grandfathers village at his 6th birthday
>Our foreign affair minister, Per Hækkerup, got drunk and then basically gave Norway all of it
Allegedly
Iceland declaring independence while we were under german occupation
You know the whole Christianity thing bro
Now that's a large scale bruh moment
"Oil is just a fad"
Denmark missed out on the oil because it didn't have the right to it according to the common rules for dividing ocean resources
Also, Ekofisk is closer to being in the British sector than the Danish one
Then I would say 22 out of 179 politicians in the parliament voting against a ban on child pornography in 1980 :D
Seriøst
Hvilken landsby var det

I'd slap you for your insolence but alas, I'm to drunk
> according to the common rules for dividing ocean resources
Yes, that is what I wrote
But there are other (sub)principles for dividing ocean resources than strictly following the median line
Had the Ekofish field been known at the time, I'm sure the Danish-Norwegian discussions had been somewhat more difficult

It's called "kontanthjælp" which translates to "cash assistance". Our high taxes goes towards for example money for those who cannot work, like cash assistance, so they can have a decent life with their own home
Meaning a lot of homeless people have also made a choice themselves that they would rather be homeless than have cash assistance for example
Yeah we usually drive to Germany to buy chocolate and soda
Haha
Ritter sport :)
If you go to the main page of this sub, you can choose "flair". On mobile it by pressing the three dots in the corner
Don't remember how to do it on pc
Not at all, and I use English extensively, as in I study at a university in England were I spend the majority of the year
But I almost never "forget" what the Danish equivalent of a word when speaking or writing it is unless it is a technial term I've literally only been taught in English
Reading this thread, it seems I am in the minority
This is actually quite good to know, as whenever one of my acquaintances would return from study exchange programmes from the USA or UK, they would seemingly "forget" many Danish words as they spoke exchanging them for English ones, and this would annoy me quite a bit as I thought they were putting on a show to seem more worldly
It seems I should have been more accepting of the fact that they might have had genuine difficulties switching back to Danish when they returned
Yeah
I sometimes say english words with a danish pronounsiation and that is actually getting quite common with the youth in Denmark
Oh yes, all the time
Socializing in Danish is literally impossible for me, and I look like an idiot IRL
English is technically my first language
But while I’m Danish I do prefer speaking English as I feel like It’s a much more expressive language, and I feel much more confident and relaxed speaking English with foreigners as opposed to speaking Danish with other Danes (Don’t have the same interests/Denmark is the worst place on earth to make friends)
Yeah, it can be hard to express slightly complex sentences because I imagine them in English and forget the Danish word/it doesn't exist
i got used to thinking in english and i don’t talk much with people in my native language so i’ve gotten pretty bad at it
it sucks, i’m trying to think more in my native language but it’s kinda hard, if that makes sense
Men inderst inde ved vi jo alle godt, at Svensk er værd at glemme
but *le travel*?
Same with me and German, I'd always use English words in the German oral exams
Min fejl, kom bare ind
In Denmark, accents are very split
I'd say our English speakers can be put categorised into four groups:
1: People, mostly the older generation, who never learned much English, as children, and therefore speak it quite poorly, and of course, with a strong Danish accent
2: People who speak English very well, with excellent vocabulary, but retain their Danish accents on purpose
3: People who speak English very well, with a neutral (American-ish) accent, usually higher educated young people, in their 20s.
4: People who speak great English, and actively fake an accent that isn't Danish
It's mostly a British/English accent, but I've heard Scottish, Irish, Australian, and basically every other English speaking country
I can do both a British and an American accent
I don’t speak Danglish, which is nice
So yeah, I think so
Nah I hate hearing myself or other Danes speaking English
It does actually hold me back at times because I think sounds so bad
My english teacher, when I went to my efterskole, was british
He told me I had a posh accent
I mean, I dont mind it
Love the language, love the people
no I actually hate it, damned potato in mouth accent
Since I grew up on Hollywood films and english video games as much as anything Danish I understand it very well and use it daily, I have tried making it more smooth but its difficult, and I have actually found myself thinking in English as much as Danish when I try to write fiction, since many of the books I love the most I read in English and draws inspiration from those as much as anything I learned during school
I like mine but it doesn't sound very danish
i really dont like the danish accent
Speaking English as a Dane is game of avoiding speaking Danglish
There's always that one guy who doesn't try to avoid it and every other Dane feels secondhand embarrassment as it sounds horrible
yeah and the 4th category are usually so goddamn annoying
like 8 out of 10 times they are doing a terrible impression of it and come across as trying to sound stuck up or better than the rest with their generic/american accent and think they are doing a great job of it
(aha sorry, got a couple of classmates who are like this)
This is too true, especially the last one
I always sound like I'm trying to fake a Scottish accent when I speak English
I know it's really annoying when people try to fake accents and I wish I could just speak with a neutral accent :\
I think it's one of the nicest things to listen to
i feel lots of Danes have an american accent when speaking English
firstly we start learning it when we're like 6, and then all of our movies and shows are in english and not dubbed so lots of constant exposure to it
If you've ever heard Mads Mikkelsen speaking, that's sort of what we sound like
sounds about right
and in my comment i wasnt talking about people actually living in the country where they speak with that accent, i meant people who had been in England/Australia once on vacation, and now think they can pull the accent off flawlessly
oh hunny, you really dont
Personally - and for people I know - it is about price vs
quality and because of Apple's business model
If you use Android, you are free to choose whatever brand phone, tablet, computer you want and they will all have more or less the same OS
But with Apple products, it can only be Apple computer, tablet and phone, if they are to work properly together
If you want iOS, you have to buy Apple, but if you want Android OS, you can choose
I don't want to be tied to one perticular company
Something I have noticed is that iPhone owners always refer to their phone as "my iPhone". "Where is my iPhone, have you seen my iPhone, let me check my iPhone". Everybody else just say "my phone" not "my Samsung, my Huawei, my LG".
Probably many reasons
Now this is the perspective from someone in their final year of high school
(Everyone is  between the ages 18-20)
A large part of it comes down to social stigma, whereas in the US iMessage is big, and anyone without a green bubble is considered inferior, in Europe, we mainly use Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger
This means that the retarded blue vs green bubble debate is practically nonexistent
It therefore has little bearing on you socially which phone you use
Then there's the question of money
Many will likely point out that large parts of Europe, especially southern Europe, people will have android because it's cheaper
Probably has an impact of some degree sure, but in my country, Denmark, iPhones are most definitely affordable enough for pretty much anyone
In fact, in my anecdotal experience, it tends to be more trashy and lower class kids who use iPhones, due to them being the ones with a mindset of anything other than apple being inferior
These are the same people who blow their government money on Gucci and Supreme
/rant
I agree with a lot of the points I've read here - seperate plans/phone, lack of need for an American item, etc
The only thing I want to add is: the price 100% makes a difference
These kids might come from well-off families, but that doesn't mean their parents think buying a phone for them is worth the same as paying into their education
I went on an exchange which my parents paid for, but my parents would never even think to buy me an iphone because it's too expensive when you can get the same or better for less money
Exactly this
My kids use Message for everything, including school groups
Yes
But iOS still have the majority of market share in Denmark
It’s 53 to 47 or something like that
It will change eventually since the share is reversed in new phone sales
True
Apple products are for kids and grandmothers
Yes
I can decide, that I no longer like Huawei, Samsung or LG and just buy a phone from another company without losing my apps
I know they are different implementations of android, but my apps will still work on all of them, so I can buy from another company and keep my apps
The rest of Europe uses whatsapp
In DK and other Scandi countries, messenger is more used
But why the need to specify that it is an iPhone
It's just a phone
It's very normal
Half of my class is 20
***Some*** Americans see people with wealth as more important than those with less
A banker looks down on a garbage man, even though the latter is arguably much more important to society
Exactly this
Where I'm from, an Iphone is seen as you pay a price for the phone it self and then you pay an extra price for the brand on top of that
If you just want a phone with good specs, you don't buy an iphone, you buy a samsung
An iphone is also seen as a phone for people who isn't tech savvy
This is spot on with my boyfriend and I. He owns an iphone and is dumb as a door when it comes to tech, while I (F) own an android phone and always has, and is pretty tech savvy
Yeah
In Sweden, Norway and Denmark Facebook Messenger is the standard app to use for texting
Young people use it alongside Snapchat
I wouldn't say i'm ashamed but Copenhagen
It seems anytime there's a bad statistic about our nation, it because Copenhagen has dragged the average down
And almost everytime you hear about something fucked up happening, it happened over there
I get that with more people there's bound to be more crime, but it's become normal that whenever we hear about something crazy that happened in Denmark, we say: let me guess
It happened in Copenhagen
And 9 times out of 10 we're right
That's not to say that there aren't plenty of nice Copenhagians
I'm sure there are
It's just the only nice ones i've met, are the ones who move away to the rest of the country, because they say it's nicer here
Vollsmose
Pretty much one of the few (and first I believe) ghettos we have in Denmark
Randers is a big joke here, not because of architecture or blandness (like other examples ITT)
We just like to joke that the people there are a special type kinda like British chav/Russian gopnik type, they drive a moped or maybe even an old VW Golf with a big subwoofer, wear big sneakers and cap, and the biggest one - drink alchopops
[Randers starter pack]
Why is it called IJ
When I visited Amsterdam we stayed in IJburg
I was really impressed with the city planning but that’s another subject
Is it short for something
I went there on holiday a while back
I was shocked by the amount of trash and graffiti
None of that sounds bad, just non-mainstream
Is that really what people have against it
Because if so, that just sounds like progressive urbanite prejudice, more than anything
The same kind of prejudice that leads Copenhageners to discount all of Jutland and its people because of it being "the countryside".
I get disliking an industrial hellhole or a modern city that's 60% concrete housing-blocks and 40% parking-lots
Calling oneself ashamed of a small rural village being conservative and, well, rural, seems incredibly odd to me however
I haven't been to Aarhus since i was a small child visiting my grandparents, so i really can't say
I'm sure it's a nice place, but wouldn't be surprised if there are some streets where you should be a bit more careful if you go out after dark
Like in all big cities
You should ask the locals
Oh yeah the addidas suit is a big one
> The bad side is that a rather large part of Urk is very conservative,
Again, that's just blatant prejudice, though I suppose it may be perceived as the opposite through a certain lens
The women not voting seems rather extreme, though ultimately that is up to them
> The local government believes it's their place to actively surpress "anti-christian" messages
Judging by what you just said, and the rest of this thread, if the town and municipality is majority-Christian, that would seem entirely reasonable
Save the part with the immigrants I address below, none of their actions seem in any way offensive or harmful towards you or really anyone but themselves
They are living their own lifestyle, in their own rural community, and in a region that seems to be of like mind
This disdain is unwarranted, not to mention intolerant
> Like last year, when about a hundred Urker people gathered around the house of a Moroccan-Dutch family, making racist chants
This part I won't defend or play devil's advocate for
That is obviously terrible
And yes, xenophobia (and a certain prideful ignorance) is definitely a particular fault of the rural
Arrogance and priggishness tend to be the corresponding failings of the urbanite
> I base myself on voter behavior, church attendance and the type of Christianity that's popular in the village
I think you misunderstand me
I'm not denying they believe these things/act in that way
I am saying *that is perfectly fine*. Another user mentioned some far more serious charges - drugs, organised crime, even sex-trafficking
All that, if true, is reprehensible no matter what
But this is a different matter
> I vote for a progressive, secular party myself
I'd hate it if they'd threaten to shut down the theater because they allow plays that paints Christian family values in good light, or a comedian who mocks atheists
Live and let live
Yet the opposite is a much more real danger nowadays
What is the great lobby in the Netherlands shutting down secular/atheist events or diminishing their rights
Where even in Britain, or in Denmark
You can, probably, if you really dig, find a few examples
I needn't dig to find the inverse
Most of the time they won't even be true examples of oppression - being disapproved of in a community where most people don't agree with you isn't oppression
The inverse, however - the ostracising if not downright persecution of conservative voices, is far more common
And I don't mean libertarian faux-conservatives, I mean people like the types you described in Urk
You have nothing to do with them, yet your rhetoric towards them does not sound very live-and-let-live at all
Saying you don't tolerate intolerance is just empty word-games
On a great host of issues, [left-wingers are much more intolerant than right-wingers] They are far more likely to block people for posting things they disagree with, far less willing to have conservative friends than vice versa, more likely to be upset if their child married a conservative, etc, etc
So yeah, if you only focus on the issues on which leftists are more tolerant, then they are more tolerant
But if you focus on other issues - such as a basic willingness to speak to people you disagree with - they are *substantially* more intolerant
The degree to which the mere existence of old-fashioned communities like Urk seem to irk you (no pun intended) is simply more evidence of this
The simply truth is that intolerance of intolerance is just plain intolerance, disguised with a veneer of rhetoric and purple prose
Now that's definitely the part I'd have started with
The first part I don't mind (the people who do get offended by its very existence worry me very much)
That list, though, is rather more damning
All that in a rural municipality with only 20
000 people
That's almost impressive
There was a famous radioseries when i was a kid called "Kris og chokolade fabrikken", where Kris called his boss every morning with some hilariously insane excuse for why he couldn't come to work that morning
My favourite was always "i accidentally swallowed a bird - i was yawning and it flew straight in". But there were so many others, some of them not entirely politically correct
"The bridge was up" is common in Copenhagen if you are transporting to or from Amager
Otherwise the classics are: train, bus, traffic
Most of these are accepted, though being late is generally frowned upon
As someone mentioned, even our plumbers are on time here
One of the first things I cover with my expat student is that, yes, even being 5 or 15 minutes late is rude in Denmark
But generally, these excuses above will be accepted as valid - especially in Copenhagen, I've found - due to the fact that trains and busses are almost always late, and traffic is often bad - even if you are on bike
In Copenhagen you can get away with just saying "I had to take the 5A bus" and people will be like: Fair enough, I'm surprised you weren't at least half an hour later
The 5A is even called "dødens rute" e.g. "The route of death/death's route" - it even says so on the bus line's wikipedia page, haha
I don't know about the rest of Denmark but in my city we always say "the bridge was up" as well
The city is devided on two sides of a strait, and if you live on  the same side as the place you're late to you of course say it anyways
This is also an excuse in Copenhagen, particularly between Amager and Sjælland
In Copenhagen we use "the bridge" too, even though they rarely open anymore
In Denmark the excuse is “The trains were delayed”. It happens so often that it’s believable
My favourite is the one with a really large binder blocking his way
If anything "My bus was late" or "I missed my bus"
In my town in Denmark we have paper, metal, plastic, glass, cardboard, organic and other
Also we can get leaves, twigs etc from the garden picked up, as well as electronics and larger items such as old furniture etc
I have a calender for trash pickup days
Yes, paper and cardboard are two different cans
Bulky items are picked up once a month and stuff from the garden twice a month (but not during winter, except for Christmas trees)
YES
I am in
My kids look at me, when I am separating the trash and ask "Is trash your hobby, mom
The old dude in the corner that seems to know best
Reality is that he doesn't but somehow he seems to get most right
He's highly paid but works very few hours, however whatever tasks he get is getting done on time but over budget
He is in general liked and does well with everyone, but in reality he doesn't really enjoy the company
He would prefer to be alone, but he's in it for the image and benefits
Farming pigs and pumping them full with medicine
Then putting them up for sale
It’s a whole crisis in my country
Cargo and Transport manager probably
Denmark is the bar owner
They’ll talk about your troubles and recommend help but mostly just give you good beer
He is also grumpy about not being part of the big decisions taken by the board
A long time ago he was actually a board-member before the company went through a long period of c-level politics, hostile take-overs and bad mergers
While he's actually better of now, less stressed and what not, he would really like to be asked about important stuff
Even though you didn't even have fax machines when he was in charge
This is shockingly true to form
That's practically cheating
It's supposed to be a place you can kick back and work on your cabin projects so you don't have to stay at home and work on your house projects
i've never cared
there's a lot of words americans use, that a britsh person wouldn't, and vice versa
i also prefer "color" over "colour". it's faster to write, it's easier to read, and it's fun to change the r, to an n.
[Someone said Euro English]
Not OP, but mine is an odd case
I use mostly American terminology, since I have American relations from whom I learned them
Yet I often pronounce said American words in a more British way
Sometimes, I use the "British" versions by coincidence
For instance, I say "sofa" and "coriander" instead of "couch" and "cilantro", not because of British English, but because those are the Danish words as well
An odd detail is that even though growing up, all the native English speakers I met were Americans, my accent has some uniquely British things
For instance, my accent is non-rhotic (no final Rs), but I do use the linking r, which I wasn't even conscious of until recently
I imagine I must have picked up a non-rhotic way of speaking from TV, despite speaking daily with rhotic-speakers
Strange
The streets were generally wayyy more dirty and filthy than they are in Europe, and the amount of homeless people were downright depressing
Also the sizes of everything you ordered from restaurants were completely unhuman lol
Also the inefficiency was surprising, you could easily spend half an hour queueing in shops or supermarkets, even though there weren't even that many costumers
But luckily, I found the regular people of America to be extremely polite and very talkative, and just nice in general
Strangers spoke to me
Just random "hello"'s and compliments
You mention extreme sizes yourself, and I can only agree
You’d think with all the talk of things being XXXL over there that you couldn’t possibly be surprised, right
oh boi
Size of Soda Cups sums it opup for me as well
I went to a Cinema while in Maryland and the small cup of Fanta I ordered was larger than the largest cup I’ve seen in Danish cinemas
Edit: Also public toilets in DC have giant holes all around the edge, apparently to deter drug use in them, felt super weird that anyone could just stare at you from outside it
Same, the amount of strangers that randomly talk to you is super uncomfortable for me personally
On the other hand, the first times I visited was before google maps and before we'd even gotten our maps halfway out our bags an american would approach and offer us directions
People in the US were just incredibly helpful and kind
The only other place I've consistently experienced people being that considerate of lost foreigners is actually Norway
In Denmark it's the other way entirely
Most Danes can't get themselves to call people "sir" or "miss", as everyone you'll meet is usually referred to on a first name basis
I don't even know the last names of most of my teachers
Here in Denmark churches are funded by a small (as in very small) church tax, that you are required to pay to participate in the Danish church (married, funeral, stuff like that)
Although I've been told that churches in the US are tax exempt, so I'd expect them to be more reliant on the individual churchgoer and less publicly funded, making the advertisements a good idea
You have la bise, many find that an excessively nice and too personal greeting for almost strangers, to relatively good friends
Norwegians definitely offered help when asked, but I've also had a ton of experiences with Norwegians just randomly approaching me first
A couple of years back a friend and I hiked from Trondheim to Hamar along the pilgrims route, we're both experienced hikers, with good gear and weren't even lost, but the second the weather got even a little bit bad we kept having norwegians stopping in their cars and offering a lift or waving as we passed their houses and inviting us in for something to eat and some shelter
I thought it was a fluke at first, but it kept happening
I left norway thinking norwegians are maybe the nicest people in the world
You have to call the King and Queen by their first names
They don’t have lastnames
The Crownprince of Denmark made up a lastname when he studied in the US
Yeah, I think it's a bit different too because the intent is to help not just chat
To be fair to the americans though, besides being too talkative they do the whole "being sincerely helpful" a lot as well
I love my country, and consider how reserved we are a peaceful and wonderful character trait
But we're just not that nice to anyone, including hikers, and that's a shame
After I got back from norway I figured if you guys could do it we can too, and I've tried to be more helpful to strangers without being asked since
I envy your gun laws
It's our queen's birthday
refused immigrants and 'illegal 'refugees  are still closed off in prison camps of several hundreds with several families, they cant keep social distancing and everybody is ignoring it
I know, still wrong
In Danish, we just spell it with one s so they are right on the money
If you got it, flaunt it, I guess
Many old names have started to become popular again
These ones are not so popular anymore:
For women: Dorthea, Ingeborg, Oda, Edith, Leonora
For men: Holger, Frode, Verner, Olaf
I know this is a bit of topic but I remember when Kevin Costners movies were super popular in Spain and some mothers would name their kids Kevin de Jesus
I always thought it was funny
`Peder` is pretty old
Very popular before `Peter` replaced it
Male names: Per, Henning, Poul/Povl, Henrik, Jens, Wagn, Ib, Steen
Female names: Åse, Ingrid, Gertrud, Inger/Inge, Margrethe
Ruth for women and Ernst for men
Halfdan - legendary Viking king who was father to Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye, who was father to Hardeknud, who was father to Gorm, the first (verified) king of Denmark (ca
Year 985)
The name means “The Half-Dane” and first appears in the sagas describing the Viking raids in England
The name is still used and is somewhat common, cong into and going out of style as it generations change
..and just as I finishen typing I discovered that Ragnar (after Ragnar Lodbrok, father to Halfdan) is making a comeback
Those names aren't German, though
Thoralf has never been a German name
The hypothetical German version would be something like "Doneralb"
Chantal and Jacqueline were given a terrible after-life in American trailer-trash and British working-class naming conventions
Believe it or not, I know someone who named their newborn kid Ilie a few years ago
Here, Nikolai would most likely be someone very young, interesting
> Aksel, Ilmari (maybe)
The Koskela names
Oh yes, they are a couple, that my wife knows from highschool, that suddenly turned "burn your passport because the chip has a sequence with 666 in it" religious
Some friends I have won't even take out the garbage in the evening or on mondays
Yeah, I don't know anyone else who can match that level of superstition
I think it's great
Should have happened 30 years ago, but better late than never
I hope to see governments and other industry do the same
ALL the time
I go to an international IB school, so I always speak english at school
Sometimes when I have to get the bus home, I have to get the driver to repeat what they're saying a few times before I'm back to danish again
Not English in particular, but sometimes when I've been in a foreign country for sufficiently long, all the Danish ads and road-signs look like gibberish at first for a few days after returning
Students at higher education are paid 830 euro a month by the government
Denmark has the world's oldest monarchy
(Edit: not true
Second oldest
Japan has the oldest
I have been lied to
The highest point in Denmark is 172 m above sea level
In northern Denmark (Grenen) you can see two seas meeting, with waves coming from two sides
We have most pigs pr capita in the world
Around four times as many pigs as people
Denmark has the oldest flag in the world
Denmark, while usually seen as a small country, is technically the 12th largest country in the world by landmass, because of Greenland
For the same reason, Denmark also has the 4th longest coastline in the world
Denmark is one of two countries in the world to have more than one national anthem, the other being New Zealand
Denmark is one of two countries in the world to have no official or unofficial national day, the other being the United Kingdom
Denmark has the oldest flag still in use
The first ever military bombardment on civilians happened in copenhagen
We have three extra letters in our alphabet
Viking culture originated in south jutland
Danes invented the first ever light machine gun (the madsen 03)
Why are you using American numbers
> Austria can be translated as The Mythical Dwarf Of The East
Sorry to say, but "Austria" is just the latinised form of Österreich/*Ostarrîchi (Old High German)
It isn't from Proto-Germanic, which was spoken some 500 years earlier
As Wikipedia says, it may have originated as a translation of the Latin name *Marcha Orientalis*, that being the earliest name of the province of the Holy Roman Empire later called the Margraviate of Austria
There was a Dwarf in Old *Norse* mythology called Austri, as part of a set of Dwarfs named after the cardinal directions, but that has nothing to do with Austria
As you say, Österreich means "eastern realm", because it was a border province, but "Austria" is just a latinisation of that word
I think Japan considers their monarchy to be older
Anyway, although several countries lay claim to having the oldest flag, the flag of Denmark is widely considered to be the oldest existing flag in the world
Officially, the flag is known as Dannebrog and traces its history back to at least 1219
The agreement [as you can see here if you scroll down a little] was not really fair as it gave Norway the ritchest oil fields while denmark got only a little bit
But maybe ot was good after all, what is Norway goong to do when the world realises that oil is not really going to work anymore
None of it is a loan
You can get a low interest loan on top of it
Yes
A very flat country
Yeah :)
Well, if we include the whole Kingdom of Denmark, there is Gunnbjørn Fjeld in Greenland
It is 3694m and the highest mountain north of the Arctic circle
It is a nunatak, a rocky peak protruding through glacial ice
Actually I just learned that Japan has the oldest monarchy and Denmark's is only second oldest
The first king of Denmark is Gorm the Old from 958 and there has been a king or queen since then
[The danish monarchy dates back to year 939]
Yes, Austria isn't rooted in Latin - it's a rendering of the Germanic word *Ostarrîchi* into Latin
That is, it's rooted in Germanic but transliterated into Latin spelling
I believe you have misunderstood the quote - it isn't saying the name Austria is connected to the dwarf Austri, it's just listing him as an example of a cognate from the same root *austar
- [Proto-Germanic] "*austrą" > [Old Norse] "austr" -> the dwarf Austri
- [Proto-Germanic] "*austrą" > [Old High German] "ōst" -> the province Ostarrîchi/Austria
But the quote is wrong to say that it's Proto-Germanic
The first documented use of the word "Austria" comes from 1147, which is long after Proto-Germanic times
In fact, it isn't even Old High German - it's Middle High German, in many ways more similar to modern German than PG
It's because of the citizens' rights directive which dictates that if you're working in any EEA country you are entitled to the same benefits as a native
I doubt that people will take you in like that
Danes are somewhat reserved
But we have hostels and bed&breakfast etc
That a airline commercial is actually anti-white Marxist propaganda meant to destroy white culture and spread cultural Marxism
First thought I "english grammar is the same as danish", just subject+verb+object
But  so remembered I "inversion". Thereafter came I in thought about that danish do have different grammatical rules
However, the most danes cannot remember them, they do them just
That is what I well like by danish
How goes it
This here sounds very hard to do, but I try it anyways
Luckily learn we english in a very early age in Denmark, so this here should not be very hard
Nevermind, it was it
**From Danish to English, version 1 (every word translated directly, but not in a confusing way):**
I have written this message on Danish first, and so translated each word to English for, so widely as possible, to preserve the words original placement in relationship to each other
I joys me to to see what the outcome of this little linguistic experiment becomes, when I once get translated these words
Such a good and fun idea you have gotten OP
It is enormously entertaining to read they others comments in the thread, and cool to get an insight in how other people naturally structure their sentences
Bothered know which influence it has on our individuel worldview, that we perceive language so different from each other
&#x200B;
**From Danish to English, version 2 (every word translated directly, but in a more confusing and comical way):**
I have written this message on Danish first, and so over-put every word to English for, so widely as possible, to conserve the words original placement in for-hold to each other
I joys me to to see what the out-fall of this small language-straight experiment stays, reaches I one-walk sheep over-put these words
Such one good and funny idea you have received OP
That is enormously under-holding to read they others comments in the thread, and fat to recieve one inside-aim in how other humans natural structure theirs sentences
Bothered know which inside-flow that has on ours individuel world-sight, to we up-understand language so different from each other

**The original message in Danish:**
Jeg har skrevet denne besked på dansk først, og så oversat hvert ord til engelsk for, så vidt som muligt, at bevare ordenes originale placering i forhold til hinanden
Jeg glæder mig til at se hvad udfaldet af dette lille sproglige eksperiment bliver, når jeg engang får oversat disse ord
Sikke en god og sjov idé du har fået OP
Det er enormt underholdende at læse de andres kommentarer i tråden, og fedt at få en indsigt i hvordan andre mennesker naturligt strukturerer deres sætninger
Gad vide hvilken indflydelse det har på vores individuelle verdenssyn, at vi opfatter sprog så forskelligt fra hinanden

**How I would translate the original message:**
I have written this message in Danish first and then translated each word into English so that I, as much as possible, keep every word's original placement in relation to each other
I'm looking forward to seeing what the outcome of this little linguistic experiment will be, once I have translated these words
What a good and fun idea you have had OP
Reading everyone's comments in the thread is really entertaining, and getting an insight into other peoples natural way of structuring sentences is pretty cool
I wonder what influence on our worldview it has, that we perceive language so differently from each other
I can really good like your idea
It is very fun to scroll through  this thread, but on my own language works it not so well
Hi, how have you all it
Handle you you okay under coronacrisis(the)
Not necessarily, on danish use we also backplaced articles, as on romanian
Our statesminister has for a couple days since announced new coronarestrictions out
I am sceptical on about people have think them to follow them, but I hope on the best
Definitely, you gotta draw the line somewhere
It's made a bit complicated by the history of FIFA, though
Corruption and shady business has been thoroughly normalized and begrudgingly tolerated (when not cheered on) as long as international football has existed, so there is a deep-rooted culture of "well, FIFA gonna FIFA" in football, which makes any single event, like Qatar's World Cup, a bit less of a standout atrocity
I agree completely
Our last Prime Minister were asked about the then new tax regulations, and said: "We've chosen to create a system where you will deliver a little more less, than before, that's our choice, and that leads to them, who earns most, and earns most, and now delivers a little more less
Yes, they'll deliver more less, than them who earns a little bit less, and delivers less, but then delivers less less
Extremely confusing and it was a big meme for a while
They should be closed haha
118 Danish people caught covid-19 at the same resort in Austria
Or it well, speeds up the process, so you get through it faster
At least that's how I always think Sick Sauna goes
Hey now, we're very much familiar with mountains
It's probably bred to not be super intoxicating
It's called travelling
Most of you swedish people live just as far away from mountains as we do ;)
I think that's also the purpose of it
Sure some people will go like "wow, weed can be my medicine, that's sick brah", but since the majority of the population isn't stoner dudebros, an alternative is needed
Also it's not necessarily the THC that has he medicinal effect, but some other non-intoxicating compound
So breeding and selecting for a high concentration of the other compound might lead to lower THC levels, while making it a better, more powerful drug towards a certain kind of problem
No, of course not :)
Actually,  one of our Queen's names is the Icelandic *Þórhildur
When she was born, her grandfather was king in the Kingdom of Iceland
Queen Margrethe II or Margrethe Alexandrine Þórhildur Ingrid
(The Denmark-Iceland union was abolished in 1944 and Iceland became a republic)
No, not really
Ireland on the other hand
Just kidding, I am reminded of Ireland every time I watch a goalless football match
Well it's not exactly like Denmark played great football in those matches either
It takes two to tango
I guess part of the reason was that Denmark had more to loose than to win in a few of those games
I think it's good, it means that Dennark goes through if they play in Ireland :) also, as a Dane the World Cup qualifier decider match that ended 5-1 was a delight
I will support rail ways going anywhere if it can limit flight usage
Honestly, I think the Balkans are too poor and too sparsely populated to support a high-speed rail network at the moment
It would end up being a very uneconomical project, that would require massive amounts of government subsidies, especially considering the mountainous topography of the Balkans
And even disregarding the cost of building the infrastructure, such a network would probably still be running at a loss just from operational costs
If the EU wants to help that region, there are be better ways to spend the money
The airport in Sofia is in severe need of an upgrade, for instance
If it means we get to tax the shit out of air travel and put the money into HSR hell yeah I would support it
> I'd support high speed railways anywhere
High-speed railways on Antarctica, let’s go
Well, that’s good
That place was so worn out and overcrowded last time I was there
Next they can maybe build a train to the airport
Also, the whole tram network in Sofia needs to be either completely overhauled or replaced
There are so many places where money could be better spent than on high-speed rail
Well, it's not like there don't exist alternatives to flying
They are just a bit slow
The fact is that high-speed train service is a bit of a luxury
And I don't think it's something the region should prioritize right now
I mean, even here in Denmark, we still don't have a single high-speed rail line, and we manage anyhow
Even with a high-speed train, I think very few would take the train from Western Europe to the Balkans
And as for regional tourism, it’s still quite an uncommon phenomenon in most of Eastern Europe, as can be witnessed by the relatively small airports there (the airport just here in Copenhagen is significantly bigger than the biggest airport in the all of the eastern EU states (which is Warsaw Chopin))
I search for my country, Norway or Sweden cause ik it's gonna be following
Depends
I'll probably look for danish comments if I have something to contribute with in a country specific question, but other than that Ioften skip danish comments
I don’t know about others but I get danish ads about sendings food to poor Africans
However the ads are mostly on YouTube so I don’t know about tv only Danes
It’s however less prevalent than in the past and commercials and ads are actually way less than say 10-15 years ago
It might be because Africa is views as developing fast and a lot better and richer than in the past
They usually send them in television around dinner time, so you can feel really bad and lose your appetite
I feel like it was more common in the 00s, but they still pop up here and there
Yes
We always get ads about saving poor people in African countries
It's often used as an argument against not eating your food, "Think about the starving children in Africa
" That's what they say
Almost all Europeans think of Africa as a continent without any food or water
Despite countries like Rwanda & South Africa are literally equal to European countries
Seriously
Tyrol must really care then
Is life really regarded as bad in Russia
I thought people lived their lives fairly well there
Russia can be terribly poor in some locations
I drove through a lot of villages on the outskirts of St
Petersburg, and they looked as if no one had been living there for 70 years
Homes were half rotten and some windows were even smashed, yet people still lived in them
Then as we drove into the city itself, everything looked like any other wealthy European city
Russia can change between poor and rich VERY fast
Just heavy advertisement then
What are the richest areas of Russia and what are the poorest areas
Generally, the richest are Moscow and St
Petersburg, but even for St
Petersburg the divide is huge
I am not familiar enough with Moscow to add anything specific about it though, but fairly certain it has a similar divide
Source: I am in St
Petersburg roughly 6 times a year, since my girlfriend lives there, so I have seen it first-hand a lot
My girlfriend does ok, but is in no way well-off
Ok thanks for explaining
It's common enough to encounter words that the first time you hear them sound a bit too much like an unimaginative Dane having a lazy guess at the English translation: "landscape", "yuletide", "ransack" etc
The word "doppelgänger". Straight up stolen, and also very similar to Danish "dobbeltgænger".
In Danish "spanioler" is kind of derogative and/or old
Now we use spanier
And depending on the pronunciation of polak (Polish person) it could also be derogative
Yeah I know it's just borrowed, I'm only joking
I think English is a wonderful language
Thats the exact same in Danish
POlak (stressed First syllable) is by some people percieved(?) as derogatory, while poLAK is okay
They discontinued the physical catalog last year here in Denmark
No, we didn't have IKEAs where I used to live so I've never seen such a thing
I don't really care about the Christmas creep, though it puzzles me that the people who complain about it don't seem to realize that they're the ones keeping it alive
First they talk about how much they hate Christmas decorations and then they buy some peppernuts and vaniljekranse (Danish Christmas cookies) anyways because they love the taste of them
If there wasn't a demand, there wouldn't be a supply
I hate snow and always drive a couple of hours to see family at Christmas, so I've been pretty happy with the mild winters we've had recently
(Although it doesn't please me that we had wintery weather in March in 2018 and snow in May this year)
Gotta get that last Euro before everyone dies
No anti-German sentiment in Denmark
I did have one funny incident
In Denmark our sirens are tested once a year
They date back from WWII when people had to seek shelter during bombings
My German collegue commented "What are those
We don't have those in Germany
What are you afraid of
" Yeah, well
Not anymore in Denmark
Its almost the opposite
You can’t blame those who weren’t born
And Germany still puts much blame on it self
And it has to stop, so they can have a future without being/feeling blamed for the past
I learned about the holocaust and the third reich's human right violations at an very early age (11) And I used to straight up hate the Germans for it
I know hate is a strong word, but it was beyond disliking
But as I grew older, I started to take more [Infomation] on what the Germans had done to redeem them self
That hatred is still in me, but it's targted at Neo-Nazis and not Germans
Hell, Germany is a country I could maybe one day, settle in
Danes tend to really like their German tourists
They're polite, patient and considerate - FAR better than most other tourists
Only thing I've heard Danes talk negatively about regarding Germany is when Merkel encouraged migrants and refugees to enter Europe, leading to the crisis in 2015
Overall, we see no correlation between the current population of Germany compared to those during the 30s and 40s.
Not really, people may hold grudges against the language, or joke that "it's the Germans again" when the sirens are tested, but overall people tend to be more neutral or slightly positive
There was an issue a few years ago, though, where the mayor of Haderslev wanted a bilingual Danish-German city sign to accommodate the minority in the area, and was met with furious resistance and nation-wide media coverage
The sign didn't last many days before it was stolen
Most Anti-German sentiment seems to have disappeared here in Denmark, but we seem to have adopted more of a mentality of "Forgive but remember".
I have a lot of family in the southern part of Jylland, that came under German occupation in 1864
My great grandfather was one of them, and at the outbreak of the 1
world war he was forced to fight for the Germans
He was shot in the leg, but survived and was found by french soldiers, who he was thankfully able to convince that he was Danish
He lost the leg but went back and witnessed the reunification of southern jylland following the war
While it may have taken him a few years to get over some anti-german sentiment, he still took in German children and housed them at his farm following the 2
world war, when a lot of them came to Denmark to avoid famine, as we weren't hit by the wartime devastation
There seem to already then be this mindset of wanting to see an end to conflict
Essentially, the Anti-German sentiment seemed to take a different turn already in the years just after the war, and over the years I think most danes have largely forgiven the Germans, even if we still meme about reclaiming the remaining land we lost way back in 1864
Absolutely not
The germans of today are friendly, funny and very kind
Us in denmark are very fond of our southern neighbours, and I think they like us too
Seems like they still be invading us every summer
So I guess there is only sentiment against their being too many of them at our beach
Not really, Danes and Germans generally get a long well, if there is any sentiment that is anti German it isn't because of the nazis
Because they drive as fast as a bloody hawk can nose dive
It's a mandatory subject they teach you in school so amongst 5th to 9th graders here then yes
Other than that no
The most anti-german sentiment is when they clog the roads, heading for the nearest beach in summer
..and then require helicopter rescue because they fall asleep floating on an air mattress and wake up halfway to England
They *do* spend a lot of money here, though, so it's all fine
(and get to pay for the helicopter too)
Actually, that’s not entirely true
It just depends on location, I think
I grew up just south of the border, and my mother put all of us in the danish private schools
I took part in some student exchanges, and have lived in Odense for 12 years
I stayed after finishing university
So, suffice it to say, I have some experience with being German in Denmark
The longer I live here, the less it’s been a problem
Occasionally, people still bring it up when they recognize my accent, but it’s rarely negative anymore
However, the further east I’ve been, the more negatively people react
We had an exchange in 10th grade with a class from Farum
They were very biased
They stayed with us for a week, and then we stayed with them for a week
While they visited us, they kept yelling about nazis whenever we were outside unsupervised
They constantly made comments, and once even verbally attacked a passing elderly man
And I know that some might think that that’s just teenage stupidity at work
And we thought so, too, until we visited them
They’re parents and teachers showed us pretty clearly where they’d gotten it from
The teachers gave them weird assignments, like “draw a German”, which resulted in like twenty drawings of skinheads
My host family fed me nothing but sauerkraut and pickles, and I wasn’t allowed to touch their cat
That was definitely the worst experience, but it’s not exactly an exception
While most others were a lot less obvious, it’s still been pretty clear to me that there are plenty of people who have certain expectations when it comes to Germans, or specific associations
I’d say that 3 out of 4 people I met in the beginning kept asking me about work morals, being humorless, beer, sausages, and whatever other stereotypes they may hold
And usually I joke about it, and say that I had to leave Germany because I don’t like beer
But I’d be lying if I said that it didn’t bother me sometimes
>they are a great tool to warn the public if there is a catastrophic event
..which is exactly what they're used for in Denmark
Hear a siren
Seek cover (get inside a building), close doors and windows, and get more information from local radio/TV/Internet
She is from München, I think
Or when they let their kids play on an air mattress in the ocean
There are accidents too often
Those things belong in pools
I am so sorry to hear that
Unfortunatly Danes are weird with people, who are different from them, not just Germans
My husband is from Copenhagen and the amount of thrashing and "teasing" he got from my family in Jutland was embarrasing
I faced some stereotyping from his family too, being from Jutland and moving to Copenhagen
I can understand that it bothers you
We used to do it every Wednesday, but now it is only the first Wednesday of May
Weird choice, too, because occationally that will be on May 5th, where we celebrate the ending of German occupation so the sirens are a bit out of place
It just gets old pretty fast
My husband never treated me like that, and it’s one of many things I love about him
And I did make friends here
It’s just almost exclusively other non-Danes
I have many friends from the muslim community, who were exceptionally welcoming
I was even invited to some weddings
And other expats, from Wales and America
All in all, I love living here, and I don’t have any intention of moving back to Germany
I really does get old
We get "Devil Island" for Sjælland all the time by people from Jutland
It's some weird inferior syndrome I guess, which might also apply to the stupid people, you have met
In Denmark a lot of people drive to Germany to shop for candy, soda and Nutella
Therefore a lot fo Danes believe that Nutella is German, because the price is a third of what it is en Denmark, but Nutella is also Italian
EDIT: Spelling
Maybe not a mismatch, but not a lot of people realise that LEGO is Danish
I also don't think a lot of people know that some stories they know are old fairytales from Denmark, such as "The little mermaid" and "The ugly duckling"
Ribena is a part of the Japanese conglomerate Suntory, originally from the Medico company GSK in the UK
I always thought it was Danish just like me, due to good branding and marketing
I some how thought it was Norwegian, as Spar in both my own language, and in Norwegian means "To save" (monetarily)
Ehm
What
I never knew that, how is sounding Danish a business strategy
Also, like u/Pistollium wrote, we do not use ä but æ, and they do sound similar
We also rarely use z, and never zs
This is just a very bad imitation of Danish
Except that Häagen-Dazs in no way sounds Danish
I honestly don't understand how anyone with access to the internet could ever think it does
To me it sounds vaguely German
If it was supposed to sound Danish they would've called it "Hansen-Is" or something
I think there are still stores with only women’s clothing
There was one close to me until a few years ago
Denmark has two beer brands called Maribo and Harboe, I can understand why he thought it was Danish
I thought too when I was a kid
It just sounds like a Danish place name
Also, they have different products in different countries, so there are no real giveaways
I've heard of problems with the Norwegian Rema 1000, and it's funny that it's the complete oposite in Denmark
Rema 1000 is one of our best supermarkets
Haha, in Denmark "Royal Copenhagen" is our "national" brand of porcelain - [
I get your point, but it almost seems insulting to us
Might as well have called it Creamy LEGO
When I was a kid I thought Ikea was Danish because their logo was red and white
They changed it to blue and yellow later on though which I thought was weird
That's interesting
Must have been late 90s, early 2000s when they changed it here in Denmark
At that time IKEA also had its headquarters in Denmark before it moved to the Netherlands
Corportate taxation was lower in Denmark than in Sweden at the time
>  Is it working out well or would it be a bad idea for the U.S?
Yes
Healthcare is seen as a right in most of Europe
Similar to the freedom of speech or religion
The state has the obligation to provide healthcare to its citizens
There are some failings like any system, but it works great for the most part
However this is our worldview and our mentality on healthcare
I can't say it would translate well into the American context
For me many Americans are selfish and don't seem to understand or don't want their taxes to go towards healthcare
I've seen people say they don't want to pay for someone else's surgery or whatever
They totally miss the point that everyone else is also paying for your surgery if/when you need it
That maybe paying a bit more in taxes could lift the quality of life for so many millions
I also have a feeling that 'this late in the game' universal healthcare is doomed to fail in the US at this time because people's opinions and behaviors are already set and their mind is made up
The older generations especially seem hung up on the details
I've always thought the "if you break your leg, live in a lifetime of debt" thing was so stupid
It would be great for them
In Denmark we have "free" healthcare and it works pretty well but it comes with a price, we pay more in tax, but in the long run its worth it
Yep, and I think no European country has a system, that covers all the things Bernie is proposing his plan should cover
Denmark have free healthcare as in a national health insurance
You get it automatically from birth
Prescription medicine is subsidized in a way that it gets cheaper the more you buy
Going to a dentist is not free as an adult but is subsidized to some extent
We have a few private hospitals which can do simple operations, so you can buy private insurance enabling you to get faster back for work
There is also a private association, which helps you reimburse different things, if you are a member:
Sygeforsikringen "danmark" is an association of 2
5 million members
This form of ownership makes "danmark" a non-profit-making organisation
"danmark" reimburses more than 350 kinds of medical expenses, including:
* Medicine
* Dental treatment
* Glasses/contact lenses
* Physiotherapists
* Chiropractors
* Psychologists
* Vaccinations
* Clinical dieticians
I just want to add that the standard vaccinations are free
Your GP is also free
And things like chiropractors and physiotherapists can be subsidized
I recently received treatment at a physiotherapist, which was 23 euro (170 kr) per session
No but it's still selfishness because you (politicians, voters, etc) can't put aside differences to implement a system that could improve millions of lives
No one wants to work or agree on anything with the 'other side' (speaking Democrat vs
Republican')
- This is purely selfishness from pride and political dogma
It's the two party system that breeds gridlock and ineffectiveness from selfishness
Bernie's M4A includes dental coverage for everyone
That's not the case here, Denmark, the country Bernie supposedly wants to emulate
I just went to the dentist an hour ago, and I can show you the bill
It was just a check up, and I will get it all refunded by my private health insurance
I also picked up some asthma medicine, and while it's eligible for rebates, it's still like 100 euro for 3 months dose
You don't pay if you go to the GP or to the hospital, but dental is only free for kids(under 18) and is super expensive for everyone else
There's a yearly cap, so you'll never spent more than 2000 DKK(roughly 250 euro), so next time, it will be cheaper
It is, but that's how it is here
>Yeah, Bernie Sanders wants to get rid of private insurance companies as well
I don't understand why this is necessary
As long as it's not necessary to have a private insurance, what does it accomplish
>Why don't people fight for getting dental covered under universal healthcare
Because extended dental care is really down the list of people's concern
Also if you are poor and receive benefits, the state pays all expenses up untill 10000 dkk per treatment
Yes, always
Our tapwater is near perfect
The only thing that's stopping me from doing it in other European countries is that horrible chlorine taste in some places
Very common, our tap water is considered some of the best in the world
I would never buy water unless it's free with my take-away meal
Tap water is the shit
Always tap water
I find it interesting though as you travel around the country, the water flavor can change
The best water I ever drank was at my grandfathers house who had dug his own well and got his own ground water
It was icy cold and incredible
In towns the water can be a bit
Does it make sense to call water bland
Water doesn't taste of much of course, but like in my flat I never have like ice cold water unless I put it in the frigde for later
From  the tap it is always
Well normal tempatured  and doesn't have that same thrist  quenching feel that my grandfathers  own well water did
Worst water is in Copenhagen
That water has flavor, and in an odd way
But I believe most people still drink it
Denmark has some of the best tap water in the world
Mostly due to our soil, great at filtering and regulating
I actually only drink tap water, bottled can have harmful chemical in the for it to taste good
Not touching that
We drink tap water in Denmark, I feel like it's something we take great pride in, but I've noticed depending on where you are it can taste slightly differently
Some even have taps with both normal and carbonated water if they're rich enough/live at the new Nordhavn
Every time we've gone to a foreign country it seems like they use bottled water for the most part
I love the German love affair with carbonation
Sparkling water seems so common in Germany, and of course you have Apfelschorle
Why anyone likes that is beyond me, but to each his own
Prost
Best or not best aside, Danish tap water is still, at least domestically, considered better, and cleaner than most bottled water which is often polluted by the plastic bottle itself
Tap water contains no clorine or any other chemical cleaning agents so the taste is mostly good
The hardnesses varies a lot depending on regions and some of it has a lot of lime, but everybody drinks it and uses it for cooking
It's typically better outside the cities and Copenhagen has the worst water, although still fully drinkable
Bottled water is mostly only used for the convenience of the bottle, and almost nobody drinks it at home
Some rural towns has their own private wells, because clean drinkable water can be pumped up directly from the ground
Supermarkets does carry bottled water, but not a lot, and rarely in larger quantities
[yes, really
If you ask Google, the first hit says Denmark is number 1
It clearly depends on which source you look at then, ecauee just by a quick google i found several sources (most governmental or NGOs) that claims the Danish tap water is amongst the best in the world :)
> that it's off the grid of the mile washing machine support sheet
Welcome to the entire nation of Denmark
Danish water reigns supreme
If Iron doesn’t float in my water, I'm not drinking it
Yeah, Google results are probably heavily biased depending on your location
Nevertheless, the tap water here is not chemically treated, only filtered (often with sand filters) and oxidized before reaching the consumer
So there is no chlorine or other stuff added that can give a bad taste
In my mind, that equals pretty good quality, but I won't claim it's "the best in the world", which is of course also very subjective
I mean sure, but most the sources I found weren't danish, but sources like WHO etc
I fully agree
If I can't overdose on calcium from my water, why even drink it
All the time
Most recently I forgot what a sink in Danish was called
Not a **huge** no, but please don't call people Mr/Ms [LastName] unless they're old enough to have experienced the Napoleonic wars
Practically everyone in Denmark is on a first name basis, up to and including the prime minister
Different rules for the Queen, but if you chance upon the Crown Prince in an informal setting, he prefers the informal tone, too
Bragging is VERY frowned upon here
Alot will cite the law of Jante should you do it, and even more people will think of it
The law of Jante is basically a long list of sentences which exclaim that you are nothing compared to the collective
Examples
"You are not more than us
"Don't think you are smarter than us
If you think of the ten commandments but all centered around you being small and nothing then you're more or less there
Don't think you are better than others
Example; don't bring up how much money you make, if you make a lot
We are generally humble and don't like people who are even remotely trying to brag or try to seem better than others
This is also what's called The Law of Jante
Some people don't like it, but to me it doesn't mean that you are a bad person for being smart, successful, talanted or rich - it just means that those things don't define our value as humans; we are all equal
It was a big no no for swedish people to cross “østersøen” if it was frozen, danes had the right to beat them with a stick
Cutting in line, Denmark really likes to follow that kind of rules and you'll get stared at
Talking to random people in shops/public areas
Danes are very private people
It's not ok to be loud in public places, unless it's in the middle of night and you are drunk ( it's still bad, but most of us have been there)
This is just a nordic thing but dont call danes “norwegians” or “swedish” and reverse
Jesus no
That's a quick way to never get invited in again
I visited the Sachsenhausen camp once
That people can show that kind of disrespect baffles me
I felt so much sorrow being there, and I think it's so good of germans to show what happened back then
This is so true
My local pizza place is run by some really nice younger guys and when they hand me my order they always say: "værsgo Hr
" (Here you go, Sir
) and it always weirds me out even though I know they're just being polite
Yeah I know I'm about 20 years your senior and my hair and beard is greying, but come on
I'm not *that* old
Nobody is "dus" with the queen, except for close friends and family
Everybody else is "dis"
I don't know how to translate it to English, but for a couple of generations ago, you had to have permission to address people directly, and if you didn't have that permission, you would be politely but sternly told that you weren't that close, and to keep a social distance
Teamachine salesman: It really takes the misery out of making tea
Mrs
Doyle: Maybe I like the misery
Us barbaric northern Europeans
That's the only time I do it too
When I was little my siblings and I would sometimes ask for spaghetti with ketchup and a clump of butter mixed in
Yup, I remember when I went on a school trip to Serbia
About 7 years ago
The victim complex was still very much alive
I've never heard so much criticism towards NATO before, and I move in some pretty leftist anti-imperialist circles at home
At my workplace many people wear name tags with only their last name
I basically cannot make myself address someone by their last name so when I first meet someone I hope intensely I won't need to say their name
I also don't generally introduce myself or ask them their name but that's just regular ol' social awkwardness
Dus all the way around
Dude, speaking with the queen is a whole mini-course upon itself
At my old place of work we had to send our camera crews to court for approval by her staff, and to lean to address her correctly
This is common in a lot of counties, but I would imagine even more in France due to the sheer size of Paris
We Danes are also more or less forced to move to Copenhagen
Very true words I guess people just want validation all the time
Ah the luas
Reminds me of my vacations in Dublin
Stayed at the Gibson Hotel at The Point, and every day we would jump on the luas and spend the day in the city
Absolutely love Dublin and I hope I get to visit again soon
I wonder who was the first brave soul that started uttering blasphemies in a way that it caught on
To see and understand how ethnic minorities are integrated different places in Europe
We also went to south France to talk with occitans
There are always exceptions, but apart from "When addressing a superior in the Army" or "Addressing another member of parliament from the speaker's stand" you're good
I'm dus with my boss, and the CEO
I've been dus with every politician I've ever met (I met quite a few when I worked in broadcast media), and if I were to meet with the current or former PM and/or some of the ministers I'd be dus with them too
Scandinavian countries' number of medals at the Winter Olympics
Danish youth are the one that drinks the most alcohol (in Europe or the World
Coudnt find a definite answer), so we come last in healthy youth culture and soberism
But we finish first in the summer olympics :)
I know
But we are very hard to become friends with and we talk about the weather all the time
And we drink a lot
I'm gonna disagree with your take on heavy metal
Yeah, we haven't struck it big as Norway has, but the metal scene here produces some amazing things
I know for a fact that some of the members of Gojira love Düreforsög, and that Metallica at least during the Master of Puppets days had a close relationship with Artillery
Hell, that album is even recorded in Copenhagen
We haven't had snow for like 10 years, how are we supposed to practise
Was amazed by the CGI in that intro, but then I saw what the show was about holy shit
Rain, wind, Vikings, (sometimes) snow
Seems pretty Scandinavian to me
I can't speak highly enough of bands like düreforsög, LLNN, Wuthering Heights, Artillery and ORM as well
The front singer in Volbeat has even made some excellent death metal with his former band Dominus
Because the other Nordic children play so booooring
Oh yeah
I totally forgot to mention them
It should be the same, really
Well, the English seems rather proud of them being raided by Danes in the Viking Age, and they took our navy and terror bombed Copenhagen in the early 19th century, so I guess we're even
Beside the memes, we are generally polite towards the Swedish, when we meet them in person, but we have found other ways to get back at them
Germans are welcomed as tourists
We are no fans of the old Prussia and the war monger Bismarck though
Once, when I was in England on a school trip, we were given a guided tour around Oxford
The bloke showing us around was a pretty affable guy, and when he heard where we were from, he apparently decided to add an extra destination
So he took us to a nice church at the edge of the campus, and talked about its recent history for a bit
Then he mentioned that back in the 11th century, just after England finally switched back to English rule, the new king ordered every single Dane in the city (a healthy chunk of the population at the time) rounded up in the church, and then had the church burnt down
This was part of a broader pogrom about the Danish population at the time
Beyond the ethical aspect, this backfired pretty bad, since it so infuriated the Danes that Sweyn Forkbeard, the king of Denmark, invaded the year after, conquering England and ushering in decades of further Danish rule
I've worked with a couple of people from the balkans (originally refugees, now danish citizens), and judging by what they've told about balkan nationalism, holy shit there seems to be some issues to work out
Seems strange, because they all seem to be decent people
But i guess the genocidal maniacs don't get asylum up here
I think my favorite German movie is Die Welle
And, I think you are handling your history perfect - not your fault, but you have a collective German responsibility to remember and teach
>he was a good guy
He was a clever, strategic and ruthless politician
I once overheard an old man saying “she wasn’t the smartest knife in the cupboard”
I like the other version better
Should be required to watch it during school, after schindlers list - in all countries
You really should watch both, esp schindlers list, it is a GREAT movie
Once you get south of the Alps, life is more laid back
In many places, they still have siestas or long lunches, and there's a lot of socializing in the evenings
Northern work ethics value hard work and long hours over relaxation and enjoyment of life
I think stress has a much larger negative impact on life expectancy and general health than one might think
Why is Italy constantly on the verge of going bankrupt then
(Sorry if that is an exaggeration, but it's all you hear about Italy in our media)
But the NOK is weaker than the Euro, isn’t it
We run around school and throw caramels at the younger kids while we're dressed up in weird costumes
On the last day of public school, before the exams, we go around the school in costumes with bags of toffees and throw them to the others
This is usually accompanied by someone on the drums (or something else that makes noise) so the classes can hear when we are coming
When that’s done we put on a show for the whole school and then we took off to a theme park
I wish we had that here
I also really like your russ music
and water fights afterwards
Or Shaving cream or soap
They banned shaving cream at my school the year that I graduated, but we still used it anyways
Principal was fuming
Yes we do, and i don't know, it's fun :)
They replaced it with a giant soap foam machine last year for us, 150
m² fieldfilled with soap foam, nw that was fun
Sounds like a blast
Honestly the only one I can think of in Leslie Knope in Parks and Recs saying ["Denmark ødelægger alle"] which she honestly did pretty well
The biggest mistake is she says Denmark instead of Danmark - but considering she isn't supposed to be a Danish character, her Danish is much better than several of the examples in this thread of actors actually trying to portray characters from the countries
Honestly, I just don't think we are a country that's represented much in foreign media, haha
Ab Fab has a pretty funny scene though, of [the main character thinking she is speaking Danish, while speaking to an actual Dane
I would actually love feedback from Russian speakers on the three Danes that are always playing Russian:
- Lars Mikkelsen (does a mean Putin copy)
- Jesper Christensen
- Viggo Mortensen
But I have no idea about how good their Russian is
Only one that comes to mind is one of the last episodes of The Office where the documentary is being released in Denmark
They watch the intro on YouTube, and it's not even Danish, it sounds like some weird Swedish German hybrid
Doesn't happen often, but when it does, it sounds horrible
I can't blame them, no other country other than Denmark can do the Danish accent
And for Danish, no one is able to do that
I remembering visiting Russia in high school and meeting with a danish professor there who had studied danish more than 40 years
His danish accent was average at best
It's sort of comical that the whole plot of The Thing, which is actually a decent movie, hinges on a Norwegian scientist not being able to speak English lmao, since he basically reveals the whole plot in that scene
He sounds like a drunk Dane lmao
We have a fair amount of Danes pretending to be Russian :)
There's actually two movies about a Danish crown prince who goes to college in Wisconsin, and meets the love of his life
The second movie ends with her reciting the Danish constitution in Danish
All the characters are played by American/English actors/actresses and their Danish is so horrible it would have been a better movie if they had no lines through the whole movie
Peter Gantzler's accent in the first episode of The Last Kingdom is so overwhelmingly Danish I almost cried laughing
WRT Vikings, I was so distracted by the fact that every member of the same family had a different accent that I couldn't continue watching
I just couldn't un-hear it and it drove me nuts
Don't the Seal People in [The Eagle] speak Gaelic
I think I remember hearing Jamie Bell say in an interview that they had to learn it, or at least a language based on it
And German - like in Angels and Demons there's two Danes, one playing a German and one playing
something
I'm not sure actually, haha
It always surprises me how often Danes end up taking roles playing all other Northern nationalities
Edit: omg never mind, the other one is apparently playing a Muslim of Arab descent, according to the Dan Brown wiki
Also, apparently his hobbies are:
Killing
Raping women
Taking hashish
How did everybody not realize how trash these movies (and books, tbh) were when they came out
> How did everybody not realize how trash these movies (and books, tbh) were when they came out
This sounds snobby as hell, but I was honestly so confused when I read The DaVinci Code
It was such a clichéd and predictable mess
The plot wasn't a thrilling puzzle or even that complicated
It was full of awful stereotypes and 2-dimensional characters
I actually felt dumber having read it
And yet, so many people praised it for being amazing and engaging
I started to think there was something wrong with me, that maybe there was some deeper layer to it I wasn't getting
Then I read some reviews, did some digging, and came to the conclusion that Dan Brown is a shit author and people have bad taste
Yup
After having just had a quick look through the cast lists of Vikings and The Last Kingdom, there are far more Nordic names in The Last Kingdom cast
There may be a mish-mash of Danish/Norwegian/Swedish/Icelandic accents, but at least they're more authentic than "Hollywood Scandinavian".
Plus, it's more fun to play "spot the Swede" than "spot yet another Brit/American".
I was 13 when I read it, and thought I was the absolute shit for being able to follow it and figure out the clues
Then I started rereading it when I was older (22 maybe
) and realized I might have found it engaging as a kid, but as an adult I could feel it killing my braincells
It's just so bad
Yeah, at least it's over quickly
In Denmark it's tradition to say "how the hell are we hiking on a mountian
We don't have mountains, but if you are walking alone on a trail and you pass a person that walks alone too
On that rare occasion there is a possibility
Dane here
What are these moun-tains you talk about
You are forgetting our "Sky mountain" ([picture] It has recently been climbed by a Norwegian who wrote a book about it ([link]
Edit: But to answer the question: We often say "hvorfor helvede skal man betale for at parkere her
" which translates to "why the heck do we have to pay to park here
I went on a biking vacation this summer
We passed quite a lot of other people also out biking with tents and all
We were greeted every time with "god tur
" / "have a nice trip
". We quickly started greeting everyone we passed our selves
But apperently you do not greet people who were hiking or biking normally (commute), only people biking with bags, tent etc
Fun fact: Himmelbjerget isn't even the tallest "mountain" in Denmark
Or you can take the boat to the base camp located on an altitude of 21 meters
This part of the trip is actually really nice, provided the weather is fair
From there you can climb to the summit in 15 to 20 minutes
True
The highest point is right behind a barn and not that interesting, so we tend to ignore the fact
[Here's the picture]
Møgel is a pretty archaic word in Danish, coming from the Old Norse word "miklæ", meaning big or large, as in Miklagarðr(the large town), the Old Norse name for Istanbul
There's also a town in Southern Jutland called Møgeltønder
If I remember right, east of Great Belt, miklæ became "magle", and there are tons of placenames on Zealand, which has that in it
As a Swede also mentioned: in Scandinavia we like to leave babies outside in their strollers during nap time
When I was a kid we had Swedish kids shows (based on Astrid Lindgren’s works) that we’re dubbed by either an old dude or lady
I’ve never seen it for anything other than that though, and I couldn’t imagine watching a Tarantino movie with that kind of dub, but it sounds interesting lol
trusting people
We expose our children to a lot of stuff that would horrify some other countries
For instance there was the whole Giraffe autopsy in front of several school kids, for educational purposes
And another with a lion
We don't really baby proof our homes, except for a gate on stairs and a few other things
Sex and nudity has become more of a tabu, but we are still pretty open about it
Funny, I remember watching Pippi Langstrømpe and that it was just dubbed by some guy reading up from a manuscript
You could unfortunently still hear the Swedish ;)
We kinda have that in Denmark with Emil fra Lønneberg and Pippi
Is that weird
That's littereally the entire point of them
We have very good bike lanes everywhere
A proud tradition
Now we can even use the whole
When I was a kid there was no internet, no smartphones, or tablets
I love the horror that shows in their eyes
Glædelig jul til jer alle
Glædelig jul mods og allesammen ^_^
Glædelig jul og godt nytår
“A town in Russia” is something you didn’t care or think about
“Honestly, as a teenager, homework was a town in Russia to me”.
There's an old Danish expression "at leve på polsk".
It translates to live together like the polish and it means to live together while not being married
It's a weird expression because I could imagine living together without being married isn't very common in a predominantly catholic country like Poland
Take a cold turkish
(Tage en kold tyrker)
Means to take a brake from something
An addiction or a bad habit
The translation isnt that great
Swedish hair (svenskerhår), hair in a mullet (short choppy sides, longer back)
Also referred to as bundesliga hair (the German soccer league)
In Danish, ''to speak Swedish'' means that you are saying completely unintelligible things
dane here
Du store kineser (great chinese), an exclamation of shock and surprise
at tage en kold tyrker (taking a cold turk), quitting something abruptly instead of over a long time, like instead of using nicotine gum to quit smoking you just stop smoking
det er en by i rusland (its a town in russia), said about things you have zero knowledge on
cant think of any other atm, i'll add more if i remember them
Mullets are called svenskerhår - swede hair in denmark
“Festen var helt Texas” made me legit burst out laughing
We don’t say it in Danish but we honestly should
Also "at være græsk katolsk" / "to be Greek catholic". Meaning you don't care at all
Example: "do you want hotdogs or pizza for your birthday
"Eh, i am greek catholic"
>Pije jako Dán (He drinks like a Dane) - Someone who is drinking too much alcohol and behaves inappropriately
Is this a new(ish) expression from drunk Danish highschoolers
Or an old one
Came looking for this
There is seemingly no reasonable explination for the phrase
It's more that you abruptly stop doing something, I'd say
So instead of buying nicotine gum to quit smoking you just - stop
It’s from the English cold turkey
It sound like “kold tyrker” (cold Turk) in Danish
> I don't know the origin though
This is a guess
Maybe its about getting one bill with a higher amount for the customer and one with a lower for accounting
And the restaurant (or whatever) keeps the difference
Also I recently heard the Russian expression "Ispansky stid" = Spanish shame
The feeling of shame you get when you see someone else doing something shameful
En by i Rusland
“Hvis jeg skal være ærlig, så var lektier en by i Rusland for mig da jeg var teenager”.
Hmm I honestly thought it would have been a higher percentage
According to these [Danish statistics] from 2016 our numbers are about the same as Poland
It's in Danish but it should be easy enough to guess what the pictures mean
Bonus question
Are you guys allowed to get married at 15
And as far as I know the expression originally is from drug addiction
getting rid of it in one go instead of gradually
word traveld far it seems
EU members has to have a democracy
The simple thing would be Hungary kicking out themselves
No better time to enact Article 13 than the time where everyone is at home and on the internet
I understand Norwegian better then Sønderjysk or Bornholmsk
Sønderjusk is almost it's own language
When I was a kid, I had trouble understanding my grandfather from Langeland
I grew up around Silkeborg, and we only visited them on Langeland once every summer
I always had to look at my dad and get some signs from him to know if I should say yes or no when they asked me stuff
The hunter in this clip is also a good example:
Yea, i understood none of that
I thought I was just bad at understanding Swedish, but I’m glad I’m not the only one lol
Same here - honestly for a moment I was like: are they just talking gibberish and saying its Swedish
It was so bad
I think I've been ruined by living in Copenhagen for the last seven years - I'm practically half Swede by now
Tbh, my dad is a garbage man and I’ve been with him to work once
It’s a pretty fun/easy job and the pay is absolurely crazy here
That Denmark isn’t Disney land or a theme park
My country have problems too
I was in California and a lot of people thought that Denmark was communist and that it was close to New York
Danish isn't that hard to learn, people say like some kind of mythical old timie language
I've had to explain to someone from Copenhagen that;
Yes I have internet
Yes I know what youtube is
All ways have to tell people that I'm not from Holland, I don't really know why people think Holland and Denmark is the same thing
I had to explain to a bunch of people in England that polar bears do not roam the streets of Denmark
But Legoland
Every time I talk to people outside of Europe that is basically what they think is all there is
LEGO and Legoland
I agree
Of course, as any person should do, be polite
It's not going to be any use not doing so
The impatient drivers who try to drive off after you have gone a centimeter past the car, or those that try to speed of in between people walking across
Cold
And should stay cold, so people are concerned about the climate change
I can't, it's physically impossible for a danish person to say consonants, we don't work like that
Say you
At least Danish sounds serious and not like it was made up by a child
I see you know what's up
And what we do have, is from public agent
You're right
Reindeer and caribou are the same animal
It's not US terminology, it's North America terminology
I support mandatory vaccinations with exceptions made for immun-compromised people and other similar cases where vaccinations are too dangerous
These cases should of course be determined by a doctor, not a Facebook group for concerned mothers
I think being anti-vaxx is being physically abusive with your children, and should be punished the same way
You don't have the right to not feed your kids until they starve just because you made them
You shouldn't have the right to withhold lifesaving medical care either
I don´t think as much about the vaccine question, but that a goverment has made it mandatory to get something injected into your body
I don´t like that
>You don't have the right to not feed your kids until they starve just because you made them
You shouldn't have the right to withhold lifesaving medical care either
That's actually a great way to explain it
Thanks
Like the incident with the HPV vaccine with a lot of people
> Fuck them all
Use a condom if you do
They should have to vaccinate their kids too
Your religion shouldn't give you the right to risk the life of a future independent adult with bodily autonomy
It's the same reason I support bans on genital mutilation for minors
They have a right to choose whether to undergo religious rituals when they are old enough to decide for themselves
No, only for diseases that are actually life threatening
The common flu today isn't life threatening except in exceptional circumstances
Punishing child abuse is extreme
That should also be out of the parents' hands
You made the choice to have a baby, you accept the responsibility of keeping it safe and healthy until it is 18
Doesn't matter what your religion says about the issue, if you ask me
> It’s also not a religion, it has all the attributes used to classify a cult
That's true of most religions
That would be those exceptional circumstances I mentioned
Also, they're adults
They can choose to get the flu shot or not
When we're talking mandatory vaccinations, we're really only talking about them being mandatory for kids
Adults are free to choose to expose themselves to danger
I don't know about other countries, but in Denmark they do not get to choose to refuse blood transfusion if the doctors think it can safe the child
Everything I can find on the topic says that people aged 65+ and those who are already suffering from other dangerous illnesses are the groups most likely to die from the flu
But you should definitely get your kids the flu shot if you're worried about it
It certainly can't hurt
But it isn't really a dangerous enough disease that I'm willing to put it under the "should be mandatory"-category, unless your child suffers from a chronic illness
We don't live in the middle ages, and the middle east is both a different culture and different religion
I'm no fan of religion, but it does provide value for a lot of people, and can be part of a functioning society as seen in many European countries
>The only difference is, they are big enough to scam people for money on the governmental level
In that we very much disagree
If you exercise the muscle, the soreness goes away faster
Of course, it's no fun exercising a sore muscle, so
pity-beer is also an option
I would not say this is a translation, but we had an energy company in Denmark called "Dong energy", I don't think I need to explain what that means ;)
I'm dehydrating after half an hour because of the heat
This warm for this long is not normal for so far north
we're not used to it
I'm working with an Egyptian, who told me that this is almost like fall in Egypt
He thinks its nice meanwhile I'm dying
I made the stupid decision to start firefighter training in the summer
I'm dying in this heat
Not really
It’s to hot here in Denmark
It really shouldn’t be this warm
A couple of days ago it was 29C, not good
It's miserable and I'm sticky
You shower and then five seconds later you're sticky again
Going to buy a floor fan when I get paid
Been drinking a lot of water
Nights are awful and I wake up i my own sweat
Send help
It’s been somewhat like this the past years
People still have their mind set that buying an AC is ridiculous
Bruv
I feel like the two girls in the tanning beds from Final Destination 3
I love it
The sun barely goes down and it's summertime, and the weather is fine
I'm literally dying
i had to lug some suitcases and travel by train, and i was literally dripping with sweat outdoors
(Aarhus-området)
you lucky bastard
today is pure agony too
that's like a month ago lmao
but yea, fuck this heat
i literally cant
When I was on vacation in Portugal it was a *very* dry heat though
It felt more like you were "roasting" but that's tolerable to me
The problem here in Denmark (and probably in Norway as well) is that the heat tends to come with humidity
So you don't feel the "roasting" on your skin as much, it feels more like you're suffocating on moist air, every part of your body is constantly sticky etc
Humidity also makes it harder for sweat to evaporate and actually cool you off
It's just running down your body in streams of nastiness
Just have to get used to it
Hey man dont worry about me, im just venting a little
> There has been a pretty strong independence/republican movement ever since the early 20th century
Lol, good luck with that
While I sympathise to a degree with the desire for self governance, the reality is that the Faroes have a pretty damn cushy setup, gaining economic and logistical support from a larger, more wealthy country, which happens to be both very culturally similar and not so large that it absolutely dominates Faroese culture
The idea that every local group and nation *must* have their own independent state is just plain silly
It is, for one, incredibly modern, but also not even evident in the modern world
I'd like to the see an independent Frisian state
Hell, the Catalans have a much more solid foundation, and even then, their prospects are sketchy at best
I'd be lying if I said it doesn't reek of a degree of ingratitude
Denmark gains very little from the financial support we provide the Faroes or even Greenland - it is a net economic drain - and yet, time and again, we effectively get spat on and pushed away
The Greenlanders are by far the worst here, but it's present both places
Them removing Danish as an official language, even though Greenland is part of Denmark and Danish is both the lingua franca and first language of 12% of Greenland's population, is laughably petty and frankly should not have been allowed
For both Greenland and the Faroes, independence is a silly and unfeasible idea, but that doesn't stop both countries from going on and on about it while continuing to enjoy the financial support from Denmark that they need to keep going
There is a great difference, in sheerly practical terms, between the economic feasibility of an independent Ireland (which is a large and fertile island, bigger than mainland Denmark), and that of the Faroes and Greenland
The former are a tiny collection of isles in the Atlantic, the latter incredibly cold and infertile and mostly uninhabitable
The only way Greenland, for instance, would be able to sustain its economy, is by massively doubling down on natural gas and oil, which is obviously not the way we want to head
Beyond that, I greatly object to any insinuation that Denmark's treatment of the Faroes and Greenland today are anywhere near as bad as Britain's towards Ireland
Even at our worst, we did not treat them *that* poorly, and today our greatest sins are if anything neglectance, not domination
We are propping them up, even at a detriment to ourselves, in large part because they quite simply need our money
The alternative is that they either massively lower their living standards, or fall into the pockets of China, Russia or the US, all of whom have their sights on the North Atlantic, and none of whom are likely to be as charitable as Denmark
I can think of several countries who would love to do so, to which I say: *rend og hop*
Close to one of which were nation states
Not since the German Stem duchies, which ceased being genuine tribal states by the end of the Dark Ages
Nearly all states in the Middle-ages and until the modern period were either the dominions of a city (which were often multiethnic) or the properties of nobles, whose possessions had no regard for ethnic lines
Even the exceptions are much more cases of "all the king's land happened to be inhabited by a single people" rather than "the people had their own state"
For continually giving them money while they respond by treating us like cruel imperialists
Sure
It's my tax-payer money that's going towards sustaining their economies for nothing in return - I feel like I (and many other Danes) am quite justified in finding it rather obnoxious
Why should we
They were transferred here at a time when Iceland was an integral part of the kingdom
That is not illegitimate
Much of the time, it wasn't even the Danes doing the transferring
Even the famous Codex Regius, which contains the Elder Edda, was *sent here freely* by an Icelandic bishop because he knew it would interest the King
Why on earth should we return what was given originally, unasked for, as a gift
Quite simple: What Denmark gets out of having the Faroes and Greenland is geopolitical influence
The North Atlantic is important and will only become more so in the coming decades
This is mostly in regards to Greenland, but by owning it, we have *significantly* more to say than if we were just a small nation at the edge of the Baltic
The problem is that so long as Greenland and the Faroes keep threatening independence, all of this is up in the air
How can we justify spending money on building up Arctic infrastructure in Greenland, if Greenland might just declare independence in a few years
Hell, if that happens, Greenland will inevitably fall under the influence of one of the superpowers, meaning that all our investments might fall into the hands of a rival
The solution is for Greenland and the Faroes to stop jabbering on about independence
Achieving it will not raise their living standards, it would jeperdise international security, and screw Denmark out of all the money we've spent
There's still a lot Denmark could and should do to help particularly Greenland, but cutting off the stream of money we're giving them won't solve that
Not unless they'd rather become clients of China, which is borderline treachery
Furthermore, the more they talk about independence, the less Denmark is willing to spend on long-term projects that might improve things
> Norwegian history book and see that
Which are obviously a far more impartial source than the Danish books
Funnily, Wikipedia concurs with the Danes on this subject, which is unsurprising, since the notion that Norway was a colony is absurd
Norway was a separate country, ruled by the same king
Denmark-Norway *had* colonies, such as the Gold Coast or the Virgin Isles
Greenland was a colony at one point
Norway has never been a colony, and to claim as much is rank revisionism
That aside, u/Huletroll said, nobody had ever claimed that it couldn't prosper on its own
Why on Earth would they
Everybody knows, and knew, that Norway was an independent kingdom in the past, besides which, as I said, Norway under Denmark *was its own country*, just not a sovereign one
It already prospered on its own, in so far as it was self-sufficient
Yet Norway is vastly bigger and more resource-rich than either the Faroes or Greenland, and comparing them is silly
A much nearer comparison would be to ask if Lofoten could "prosper" on its own
There is a substantial difference between items plundered by conquest, and the items gained by locals giving them uncompelled and unasked for
Why are they illegitimate
You say they were colonial, but Iceland was never a colony
Denmark treated Iceland poorly, but not as a colony
You trying to equate the situation with Britain and India is patently dishonest
And I repeat, why is it illigitimate for an Icelander to give an item to the Danes, and the Danes then to keep it
Had they been taken by coercion or plundered, you would have a case, but they were not
They weren't "gifts", they were gifts plain and simple
Officially they are 100% integrated
In practice, their governments are very devolved
It's an odd situation where, in principle, they have no autonomy whatsoever, whereas in reality, they are more independent than, say, Scotland in the UK
There is no mention of an independent Greenland or Faroes in the Danish constitution
People speak of *Rigsfællesskabet*, "The unity of the Realm", and act as if there exists a Realm of Denmark which includes Greenland, the Faroe Islands and Denmark proper
In reality, there is no "Denmark" separate from "The Kingdom of Denmark", and Greenland and the Faroes are an integral part of the country
Unlike the UK or the Netherlands, Denmark's possessions are not *legally* their own countries, although they are treated as such
So in theory, we could revoke their devolved governments without breaching the constitution in any way
That would obviously cause an outcry, although I do think the rope has been lengthened a bit too much
The Greenlandic government, for one, is essentially run by the hyper-nationalist urban elite of Nuuk, whose views do not, from what I've heard, represent the broader population
*Most* Greenlanders outside of Nuuk are more pragmatic about the union with Denmark, but because the extremist factions in the capital have all the influence, that is the direction the country is being pushed
This is part of my issue with the whole thing - in practice, they control *everything* except foreign policy
So we fund their economies and provide them with defense, while gaining nothing save the geopolitical influence
It really is an incredibly favourable deal to them, yet they act as we are somehow impeding them
When I let google auto-finish, I get:
"Danskere er født med en bajer i hånden"
Meaning: "Danes are born with a beer in their hand"
I guess to the other Nordic countries, the danish are probably born with a silver spoon in their throat
My dad usually told me that my parents bought me in IKEA/Bilka/JYSK, and that they unfortunately couldn't return me
Privileged kids are born with a silver spoon in the ass
Danes are born with a beer in their hand
Danes are born with a silver spoon up the ass
According to google
Very true
Yeah I was about to write "En Tuborg og kanelsnegl" = "A beer and a pastry"
Hey man, if you're smiling, I'm smiling :D
Hmm, idk
In denmark (small country) we have our flags freaking everywhere, we don't sing our national anthem every morning (we arent nationalists
Randers is a good example in Denmark
It has its defendants, but generally it is the joke of the whole nation
For some reason it has gotten the reputation of being full of scooter/moped riding wannabe gangster teenagers who's worst sin is staying out pass their parents' curfews
In the US, public transport is mostly for the poor, from what I know
Poor people in the US tend to have lower education, less access to mental health care, and there is also more homelessness in general
All of these, I think, contribute to a higher tendency of mental breakdowns, resulting in these episodes
Also drugs
Rampant drug abuse seem to be a much bigger problem in many US cities than it does here in Denmark at least
That's my completely unresearched, gut-feeling 2 cents, anyway
People get better treatment for mental health issues
They don't end up acting crazy on the streets because they get the help they need
But it's muh freedom, you can't expect a doctor to help you if you are in need
Tax are stealing
Good thing we 'Muricans are the 100$% freest so we can choose to go bankrupt for calling the ambulance

Paragraf 1
>Denne grundlov gælder for alle dele af Danmarks Rige
This constitution holds for all parts of the Danish realm
&#x200B;
Seems sorta self explanatory, but its not the weirdest line that's sorta meaningless in a modern context
The next parts are about how the King (i know we have a queen but the constitution says its a king) inherits and when he becomes of age
And then it goes on about the lutheran church
PART I
This Constitutional Act shall apply to all parts of the Kingdom of Denmark
The form of government shall be that of a constitutional monarchy
Royal authority shall be inherited by men and women in accordance with the provisions of the Act of Succession to the Throne of March 27, 1953
Legislative authority shall be vested in the King and the Folketing conjointly
Executive authority shall be vested in the King
Judicial authority shall be vested in the courts of justice
The Evangelical Lutheran Church shall be the Established Church of Denmark, and as such shall be supported by the State
(Folketing is the Danish name for our parliament)
>§1
>This constitutional law is valid for all parts of the Kingdom of Denmark
..well, that was boring
Extra Bonus: "Jydske Lov" from 1241 is a precursor to the constitution begins as follows:
>[The] Country is to be build by law, but if everyone were to accept with his own and let others enjoy the same right, then no law would be needed
No law is as good as the truth, but where one is in doubt about the truth, then the law shall show the truth
The Preamble to the most famous of our (many) constitutions is quite verbose:
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
>By law, land must be built, but if anyone would settle for his own and let others enjoy the same right, then no law was needed
But no law is as good to follow as the truth, but where there is doubt as to what is truth, the law must show the truth
>If there was no law in the country, he had the most who could take the most
Therefore, the law must be made in the best interests of all, that the righteous and peaceable and lawless can enjoy their peace, and the unjust and evil can be fearful from what is written in the law, and therefore dare not execute the evil which they have in mind
It is also true, that when someone cannot be lured to do good for fear of God and love for justice, then the fear of government and law of the land can prevent them from doing evil and punish them if they do
>The law must benefit honor and justice, it must be tolerable, according to the custom of the land, appropriate and useful and clear, so that everyone can know and understand what the law says
The law is not to be made or written for the special benefit of any man, but according to all their best interests, who live in the land
No man shall judge against the law which the king gives, and the land has adopted, but according to that law the land must be judged and governed
Nor can the law passed by the king and adopted by the land be amended or repealed without the will of the land unless it is manifestly contrary to the word of God
>It is the task of the king and the countrys earls to watch judgments and to do justice and to save those who are being wronged, such as widows and helpless children, pilgrims and foreigners and the poor - those who are most often wronged, and to not let evil people who do not want to improve live in his land
For the King punishes and kills the wicked, he is the servant of God and the guardian of the land
For just as the Holy Church is ruled by the Pope and Bishop, so every land must be ruled and guarded by the King or his officials
Therefore, all who live in his land owes him fealty and are bound to serve him, and in return he is bound to give them peace
All worldly rulers must also know that with the power God gave them in this world, he also assigned them to guard his holy church against all demands
But if they are forgetful or unjust and ignores the law then on Judgment Day, they must be held accountable, if the freedom of the Church and the peace of the land is diminished in their time
>Everyone who sees this book must know that King Valdemar, the second son of Valdemar, the son of Saint Knud, when he had been king for thirty-nine winters, and a thousand and two hundred and forty winters after our Lord was born, in the following month of March, wrote this book and gave this law, which is written here in Danish, in Vordingborg with the consent of his sons who were present , King Erik , Earl Abel and Count Christoffer, as well as Uffe, who is Archbishop in Lund, and Bishop Niels in Roskilde, Bishop Iver in Funen, Bishop Peder in Aarhus, Bishop Gunner in Ribe, Bishop Gunner in Viborg, Bishop Jens in Vensyssel and Bishop Jens in Hedeby and also with the consent of all the great men who are in his kingdom
This Constitution Act shall apply to all parts of the Kingdom of Denmark
The form of government shall be that of a constitutional monarchy
The Royal Power shall be inherited by men and women in accordance with the provisions of the Succession to the Throne Act, 27th March, 1953
The legislative power shall be vested in the King and the Folketing conjointly
The executive power shall be vested in the King
The judicial power shall be vested in the courts of justice
The Evangelical Lutheran Church shall be the Established Church of Denmark, and) as such, it shall be supported by the State
There is A LOT about the King and the Folketing, and administration, legislation and structure of the courts before it gets to the rights of the people (part VIII)
It is actually kind of important to specify that it also applies for Greenland or the Faroes (and Iceland, at the time of writing I guess)
The constitution was implemented on the Faroe Islands (1850) and Greenland (1953), before they got home rule
The acts granting self-governing status are legally "normal" Danish laws within the constitutional framework
It doesn't specify it applies for Greenland and the Faroe Islands
It specifies it applies to the entire Danish state
After 1953 Denmark no longer had any external territories as Greenland with the implementation of the constitution was incorporated into Denmark (some one hundred years later than the Faroe Islands)
Iceland declined to implement the constitution
Section 01 applies to Denmark proper, Greenland and the Faroe Islands
It's not specified
It was added as late as 1953, when Greenland was incorporated, and not when the Faroe Islands were incorporated in 1850
It's is also a thing in r/denmark "det er fredag mine gutter" followed by a picture of Kaj from Kaj og Andrea
We have the same thing on r/dankmark
But instead of wednesday it's friday and instead of any frog it's the main character from an old kids tv show (maybe not that old, I'm 17 and saw it a lot when I was <4 years old), know as Kaj
We even have a special kind of cake, which is sold in most bakeries around the country known as "kajkager", or kajcakes
He is one of the mascots of r/dankmark
Denmark has it on fridays as well
Same in Denmark
Which frog do you guys use
Are you implying that the wider europe isn't familiar with danish childrens shows
To expand on this: Every Friday u/CalmYourDrosophila posts a drawing of a human-like [Kaj] The image is filled with clues that references what has been hot(ish) topics on r/Denmark during the week

We were in a hotel packed with chinese turists, my brother’s girlfriend picks the last butter from the breakfast buffet - as she continues to scout the buffet, a chinese bloke comes up, takes the butter from her plate and leaves
Obviously not
[This picture] of Queen Margrethe II
She’s got a cigarette, a juice box and some bread
Perfectly sums up the Danish mentality of [the Law of Jante] which is an integral part of Danish culture
Just because Margrethe is the queen, it doesn’t mean she can’t smoke whilst drinking a juice box and eat some bread
[She's got a love for hotdogs as well]
the law of jante basically just means, don't think you are better than anyone else because you are not
To be honest, I'm not sure what it is
Could be some Swedish abomination
I feel sorry for the Copenhagen area, because they are so close to Sweden
Truly a tragedy
We have what we call the rotten banana which is the west coast of Jutland
It's a lovely place to go on holidat but by now there's not much else left
All companies left, farming declined and cities are increasingly being depopulated
Also the island called Lolland (yes lol-land) is know to be the place the society outcasts go to live because of extremely low housing prices and fairly boring nature
Western Jutland
For specifically the kids and families that have to deal with indre-missionske
And since western Jutland is known as the most religious part of Denmark, I’m sure they also have most of the inner missions, which my mom says are our “religious conservatives”
And as a person who has been really really religiously conservative in the past, I kinda get why it can be frustrating for kids
Although I’ve never officially been a part of the moment of inner mission
Thanks
Lol
I answered Copenhagen because they're so close to Sweden
I guess that whole region is shit
finally someone agrees
Western Jutland is only second place for me
Lolland is worse
They dont have the attraction of the North Sea, and with all the unemployment and people moving away it is hard to see what they have got going for them
Agree with Lolland, the Island is seen as the worst part of denmark, but hey, atleast lalandia is there
I’m not an expert on lolland
I sometimes forget about it so I’m unfortunately not knowledgeable about it enough to include them
But thanks for reminding me about their hardships (:
What is a “major” event in your country, that no one from other countries seem to know of
In Denmark, a land slide election is not a general term for a big change or a large victory at an election
There is only one: THE land slide election of 1973
The second biggest party after that election, second only to the socialdemocrats, was Fremskridtspartiet, which among other things ran on cutting all taxes to 0% and abolishing the military
Their defense policy was in all seriousness to abolish the military and replace it with a voice mail saying "we surrender" in Russian, German and English
The war of 1864
Denmark lost two fifth of its territory to Prussia in a devastating war, with the bloodiest battle in Danish history being the one fought at Dybbøl during the war
It was a major defeat and ushered in a period where the Danes really formed this identity of being a small European country, never again to rule the waves as we once did
To everyone else it's that funny little war that Bismarck used as practice for the wars that would lead to the formation of the German Reich
That Denmark had a upper house in our parliament; [Landstinget] originally, membership and the electorate was restricted, the bicameral system was abolished in favor of unicameralism
Wait, what
>The Schleswig-Holstein question is so complicated, only three men in Europe have ever understood it
One was Prince Albert, who is dead
The second was a German professor who became mad
I am the third and I have forgotten all about it
>Lord Palmerston
Though the consequences of the Battle of Dybbøl can NOT be underestimated, it isn't the bloodiest battle in Danish history
That would go to the Battle at Lund in 1676
I believe that's the conservative number - we apparently have a lot more peace settlements than 13, indicating that we've had more wars
judging from the Danish history of war Swedish and German should be the only two
I think you might wanna look up who Olof Palme is my friend ;) Otherwise yes, you're right
Yes, it's simply called 1864 as far as I know
Much of it was actually filmed in Czechia :)
Very accurate vice versa as well
Next to a statue of Charles, as I understand it
Hardly an endorsement of either one, when you're placing top diametrically opposed men beside each other
In your culture, what feels illegal even though it technically isn’t?
Denmark has a long tradition for “Friday candy” (fredagsslik)
Basically, in many homes with children, you’re only allowed to eat candy on Fridays, and then you often make it a binge with a BIG bowl in front of the TV
A nice little tradition
I never had this rule as a kid, but it still feels
*wrong* to buy a bag of candy on a Tuesday night
Walking into a supermarket with a bag from another supermarket D:
Not after the recent price hike on plastic shopping bags
(now we pay ~$0
70 for a bag, and *everyone* brings their own bag - just like the law intended us to do
I'm about to do that right now
they had a great value price for salmon in føtex, but all the other great offers are at netto
If I end up paying the same for a glass of water as a glass of coke, then I'd want something for my money
Restaurants, cafes and bars are allowed to charge for tap water and do it ...
Wow a whole facility for wallstreet bets members
It always seemed weird to me how France is such a cheese country yet you don’t have cheese slicers from what I’ve seen
> Drinking wine in anything that isn't a wine glass
No one around me really cares, but I always have an hesitation moment before pouring
Wait, what
To me it seems the more rural you go in France, the more casual people are with their wine
I mean, sure you'll get a wine glass in a restaurant, but for getting a glass with a friend on a sunny afternoon
Any glass is fine
And as a woman, thank fuck for that lol
I don't even understand this system, you know nothing about the person, based on what do you say yes or no
Just if the person is hot or not
I know it sounds weird but the cat lover in me wish we had stray cats : ( Or at least the amount of them I saw in Greece
gasp
haha alright sounds good
Please, as a student, I did that _before_ it was popular, and to top it off, I would use the bag as a garbage bag after it got too used to be able to carry groceries
I wish you luck
I also feel like a lot of people see Scandinavian countries as perfect angels free of sin (past and present) so when we do anything wrong we get so much hate
Not that many of us don’t simp for our great reputation though
I’m fearing a US like worship of the country and it’s ways
thank you, needed that, better log of Reddit and go then
Unironically I'd love to have your water culture here
I love ice
Ice cubes feels like the biggest luxury
I was once at someone's house and they had an ice cube maker and water dispenser build into the fridge, American style, and I nearly fainted
> My guilt is proportionate with the quality of the wine let's say
I agree with you there, then
Most wine I've drunk off regular kitchenware was bought by the liter in those bring-your-own-jug wine shops
also, sun, cheese, and bread makes any wine taste good
and now I want to go on vacation somewhere warm
Yes it is
But since I have started using reusable bags, I now have to buy rolls of garbage bags
Haha, my mom and her husband has a fridge like that
Det er sgu fedt der altid er isvand og/eller isterninger klar
Denmark so angelic perfect, monks at Lindisfarne simply died from awe when they saw us
Ahem
They definitely aren’t.
When people have ice cubes, they fill a special ice cube tray or bag with water and freeze it in the freezer
But outside of restaurants (and even then it’s not guaranteed), I have ice cubes like
a couple of times a year maybe
In Danish, you can say slik, snolder or godter, although the last one is rarely used anymore
It is used around Christmas as "julegodter" = Christmas candy / cookies
None of the words are related to genitals
Also, when Norwegians say "knask eller knep" it sounds a bit dirty to Danes, because "knep" is Danish slang for "fuck".
Damn, Norwegians are much more kinky than I thought
It reminds me of a time when I was visiting my company's office in Oslo for a few days, and I asked if anyone wanted some "morgenbrød" the next day, because then I would bring some
Not exactly “no other languages”, but rare enough:
- Gender neutral and uncomplicated (no extra meaning like “friend”) word for boyfriend/girlfriend
- Most different vowel sounds of any language, one study said
Hard to measure but it has to be up there
- No articles like the/el/la/die
The word gets another ending instead
A horse, the horse, multiple horses, all the horses - en hest, hesten, flere heste, alle hestene
- Completely random choice of gender
We have neutral and common gender
There’s not even an arbitrary rule where you can say “oh most animals are x and fruits are y”
- The soft d. Insert dick joke here
The other way around; Danish has no word for "please". We have ways to sound polite (we just don't use them much) but no single word or phrase, that are always used
The way we say numbers out loud
First of all we say the numbers "reversed". In English 32 would be thirtytwo
In Danish 32 would be two-and-thirty
The way we say 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90
Example: 60 is in Danish would be tres, which translates to "three's". It originates from tresindstyve, which means "three-times-twenty". Makes sense, 60 is 3×20
80 would be firs (from firsindstyve)
"fours" or "four-times-twenty".
But it gets more complicated
50 is halvtres or halvtresindstyvene, meaning "half-three-times-twenty", which doesn't really make sense
70 is halvfjerds or halvfjerdsindstyve, meaning "half-four-times-twenty"
90 is halvfems or halvfemsindstyve meaning "half-five-times-twenty"
77 would be syvoghalvfjerds(-indstyvene) = "seven-and-half-fours(-times-twenty)"
A bit confusing
Hygge, it can’t be translated directly but it means something along the lines of having a good time
The simple answer for Danish without doing any research on complex grammar in my language, would probably be the word "hygge" which I am obligated to feel proud of
It's the cozy feeling you get when being in good company
However, if you've enjoyed hanging out with someone, it could be called "hygge". So it's just a positive in general
How cool
We got that too in Danish
More common with people who have stronger dialects, especially around the island of Fyn and some parts of Jylland
Same in Danish
"Kraftædeme" is a Danish swear word meaning "cancer-eat-me".
You forgot _stød_ which most dialects have but is pretty Danish
It's a kind of throaty effect on some words as it's phonemic in speech: _billigst_ (cheapest) vs _billist_ (car user) only really differ because of _stød_ as the G is silent
Also we do that weird thing with the letter D. Actually pretty much any of B, D, G do strange sounds after vowels
That must translate to the Danish word "hygge".
"Hygge" means all the things you listed above
Does it cover small words also, like prepositions and pronouns
Could you say "Me and my dog are going to the park for a walk" in swearwords
Same goes for "Trøndersk", which are dialects found in West and Southern Jylland in Denmark and in the Trøndelag region in Norway
Example from a Southern-jutish dialect in Denmark
" A e u o æ ø i æ å, e a." which means  "I am out on the island in the river, am I".
> Ich gehe mal zur Schule
A Chinese friend who doesn't speak German once explained to me how they use the phrase 一下 to soften their sentences: "It literally means 'one time' but we use it to make sentences more natural; it's very hard for non-Chinese to know when to use it
" And I was like "Oh yeah, like '(ein)mal' in German, got ya
IIRC halvtresindstyvene is supposed to mean 2
5\*20 = 50
"Half three" is 2
You can say opholdsvejr in Danish too
You do of course realize people from Sjælland have an equally strong dialect to the rest of us, right
Yes, you don’t think of it as a system
You just remember 50-90 like you remember any other words
And it’s really cute too
Kæreste, meaning “dearest”. A couple is *kærester*, dearests
I get that it’s not exactly *only* in my language
Kæreste means “dearest” in Danish
In Spanish there are at least some general guidelines, same with German, where we learned that most fruits were female for instance
Kæreste, meaning “dearest”. Æ is like the sound you make when you go “ehh
”. Kæ-ruh-stuh
When someone is a couple, they’re kærester, dearests
True
We are always awkward about that
Eller "Jeg vil gerne bede om rødgrød" eller "Vil du være venlig at give mig rødgrød", men der er ikke én vending eller ét ord, der dækker please
I understand, but I just don't get how 2
5 would be half three
In Danish it would be 'skadefryd', but a lot of our words come from German
My little sister Tilde has been Tildchen since I learned German in school
I do, I think you misread my sentence
The inhaling "yes" is (in my experience) more common in dialects from Fyn and some parts of Jylland
Yeah, it can be used for anything, really
You can use it to describe people, describe the mood around you, describe your new lovely lamp
Yes, a wallpaper could be "hyggelig", but not anything can be "hyggelig".
Most of the time "hygge" means a somewhat cozy atmosphere
Sometimes it just means nice (example: det var en hyggelig dag = it was a nice day), but most of the time it means cozy
Music is a great example, "hyggelig" music isn't just any good music
"Hygge" music has to be happy and not too loud to be "hygge".
A "hyggeligt" wallpaper isn't just any pretty wallpaper
It has to create a cozy (cozy isn't the most accurate word, but it's the closest English word) atmosphere in the room to be "hygge".
It's difficult to explain
Not really
In the year 200 or so, Norwegians from Trøndelag attacked and settled in the area of West-Jutland and Southern-Jutland, and those dialects today are called Sønderjysk and Vestjysk
Keep in mind that over many years, Sønderjysk have had a stronger germanic influence, whereas Vestjysk kept closer ties to West norse
The only thing they have in common with Trøndersk is the vowel sentences
A better translation for halvtresindtyvene would actually be "half-thrice-times-twenty". That means a "half" away from thrice, which would be (3-0
5)\*20 = 50
No I got that, I was simply responding to your "stronger dialects" part, as for me it seemed like an odd word choice, no offense meant of course, it's just a common thing I meet as someone from Jylland living in Copenhagen
Loads of people from here seem to think that strong accents are somehow a "fyn og jylland"-thing
Almost all Danes have strong accents
For example, to me, people from Copenhagen or Nordsjælland have a very strong accent that I find hard to not take note off whenever I hear them speak, whereas people from say, Aarhus or Esbjerg don't (and Im not from either of those places, btw)
Ahh, that makes much more sense
Agree now that I look at it
As someone who's grown up with parents from both Jylland and Sjælland I don't really have a dialect, in Jylland they think I'm from Sjælland and opposite applies to when I'm in Sjælland
I personally think people who have the strongest dialects (really quick to put a finger on) are Copenhageners, North-jutes, people from around central Sjælland, like Næstved, Bornholmers
It's sometimes difficult to hear Sønderjysk apart from Vestjysk if you are not from the area
Næstved is certainly one I always stumble over whenever I hear it
I think with Sønder and Vestjysk, much of the reason why their dialects can seem stronger is that they are in a way speaking a sub-language to Danish when they speak Sønderjysk or Thybomål. The same could be said about Bornholmsk or even my Østjysk at times, where we also have words that you don't say either outside or area or Jylland in general
But say, for example, a person born-and-bred in central Copenhagen to me has an equally strong and at times hard-to-understand dialect (to be fair, I've lived here 7 years now, so I do understand people by now)
Think Kim Larsen or Erik Clausen for example or the examples this [language expert talks about]
I'm pretty sure that for science reasons it has to be winter time, but I'd prefer summer time because it means that I can bike home from school or work without having to bring my lights all the time
Bro think about us northerners
And what should Denmark use
Longest living or the first known domestic cat
The way you phrase the second one makes it sound like Brussels airport is the biggest airport that sells chocolate, as in there are larger airports in the world but none of them sell chocolate
Personally i'd like city's or towns that aren't country capitals like, München, Bergen, ~~Edinburgh,~~ Marseille, Salzburg, Gibraltar, Florence etc
or a border area like Malmö-Copenhagen
I think a The troubles setup with Dublin and Belfast as twin cities would also be interesting
Edit: as u/Applepieoverdose correctly pointed out Edinburgh is most definetly a Capital it
Apologies Scotland

oh my you are definetly right, will have to edit that, my apologies Scotland
It was pointed out to me, for some reason i thought Glasgow was the capital of Scotland, i have thus stricken it, but i have chosen not to remove entirely as i think ignorance corrected is worth showing
>Imagine having a mission blowing up a biker gang's clubhouse with rocket launchers
In a sleepy residential area none the less
Fuck, now I want GTA: Great Nordic Biker War
That is a good question, i think i should specify country capitals, as i would otherwise lose too many bigger non-country capital cities

The little Mermaid statue

The National Aquarium of Denmark, also known as The Blue Planet
Absolutely ludicrously overpriced, mediocre food/drinks in their restaurant/cafés, and overall bland collection of sea life
(Except for the lovely otters)
I’d know since I’ve been working there for the last 1
5 years
I went to Lapland once as a prize from a Game of Thrones competition
The trip was amazing - sleeping in an ice hotel, riding snow scooters etc
- but when I found out what these activities would've actually cost me if I had to pay myself, I would never have gone there
So expensive
First time I was in Barcelona (in '97, I think) I saw a guy casually picking lifting the purse off a scantily clad tourist's shoulder, and run off
He got maybe 10 meters before he was side tacked by an equally scantily clad girl, and he had barely hit the ground before an anonymous old panel van rolled up, and two uniformed cops jumped out, cuffed the guy, and threw(!) him in the back
The cops jumped in and drove off again, and the tackling girl handed the purse back to the victim, adjusted her sunglasses, and strolled off in the other direction
The whole thing lasted less than 20 seconds, and practically no one noticed
The victim didn't even have time to raise her voice before the guy was eating pavement
I was very impressed by the effectiveness of the Spanish police that day
I was less impressed by the effectiveness of the company I was there to consult for, but that's another - far nerdier - story
Who in their right mind would even use a taxi in Prague
The city has some fine public transport for reasonable prices
You can always spot the locals as people sitting along the harbour with cans they bought from the kiosk down one of the side streets for a fraction of what they cost at the restaurant 10 metres away
Nyhavn has the nicest public toilets
Well worth the 2kr fee to use them
Vilnius is close to the top on my to go list
But a big fucking unit, if I ever knew one
The toilets by the boats, near Kgs
Nytorv
I've never tried them, but they look kinda nasty when you just walk past the stairs
> I’d actually really like go to Eastern Europe sometime if I get the chance
Pandemic aside, it has literally never been easier
Ryan and Wizz Air has plenty of flights all over, and usually a low prices
I've driven through the Puszta a few times
Shit is flat and filled with tiny, badly maintained villages
Only reason to stop is to fill the car
Best Italian restaurants I have been to, has been 6 table restaurant down a tiny alley in Florence, and a restaurant in an industrial zone out of Bergamo
Both places had people in white shirts and ties coming in for their lunch
Yeah, they're up by the anchor monument
You go down a flight of stairs, and then you enter a pretty cool space with dark wooden doors, brass fittings, and nice tiles
I was definitely not expecting that the first time I went down there
Ah, found a picture:
> place looks a bit old or a bit shabby or cutre (given that it's not completely disgusting ofc)
Definitely
I got my best Paella ever at some small and cutre place down a quiet alleyway on the outskirts of Las Palmas
A sharing platter for 2, for the price of 1 Paella somewhere else
Para dos, yes yes, I'll have it
Oh, I get 2 beers as part of it
Por supuesto, mi amigo
I don’t like beer and handball leaves med cold
Surprised I haven’t been kicked out of Denmark yet
Well I’m blond, bearded, tall and blue-eyed, and boy can I eat some Danish while drinking a six pack of beer
Other than coffee, I don't really fit the Danish stereotypes either
I guess I get pretty Danish when I'm drunk, but that's more of a definitional thing
Sounds horrible
Couldn't they see we were just minding our own damn business
Ironic looking at the ideological developments in Poland
The entire film series [The Prince and Me]
They start by getting basically everything wrong about our royal house (we don't have a king, we have a queen
Also, it's a big issue that she's a commoner in the movies despite both our princes having married 'commoners' without any sort of backlash or issue from anybody or anything
Just to name a few)
They mess up all the Danish names, they mess up the cities, all the costumes, and the entire language
Basically, they just make up everything and then claim it's "Danish".
Also, quite hilariously, they have a "Norwegian princess" in movie two, who wants to marry the prince because her country is poor
Norway is apparently poor according to them
I can't really give you an example of one film that portrays Denmark in a cringy way, but usually whenever Denmark is mentioned in a film or TV-series, it's something about HYGGE (pronounced "HOO-GA" if they're English speaking), the Danish welfare, something-something "socialism" something or the Danes being the happiest people on earth
It's obviously very one-dimensional, and it becomes a bit tedious when you've seen these portrayals a million times
Hahaha I saw that as a child
Quite liked it since Denmark is rarely in foreign movies
I wonder how I would feel about it now
Username checks out for this
Username checks out
I think a classical example is when a scene is supposedly taking place in Denmark, they often are filming in another country because the actual Danish terrain is too boring or does not fit their idea of Denmark
An example could be at the end of "The Danish Girl" they used a shot of a fjord in Norway for Vejle fjord
Also in Vikings, at some point they are in Hedeby which apparently according to them lies in a frozen tundra
I’ve seen the “Danish (scandi) people like to be naked all the time” stereotype too, and it’s kinda dumb imo
Being topless at the beach in summer when you’re trying to get a tan =/= naked 24/7
I also find that people in the Nordic’s are often portrayed as being kinda distant from western (American) society, as if people here don’t know anything about America at all, and have never seen any kind of technology before
It’s just
odd
The fact that he's called Edward really gives it away that they probably just wanted to make a movie about the Brits, but went with Danes because it seemed a more "likely" scenario
Wait until you see the one where they go to [South East
Asia]
They also did it with a bit of cheek - whereas The Prince and Me takes itself about as seriously as a romcom can
The prince and me
It is also discussed in this thread
I heard some guys (Danish) on the bus once, chatting to a couple of girls about how the people of Skåne (Scania, southern most province in Sweden), secretely want to be Danish again, and that every year on some date, the people of Skåne collect buckets of land in a symbolic attempt to return said land to the Danes
The girls these guys were chatting up were Swedish
I write "α". My handwriting looks like the one of a 5-year-old, so it would look completely ridiculous if I tried to go refined by writing "a".
I've actually encountered it a lot
Usually only with women/girls, though
I would write æ a bit like this in handwriting: œ.
Imagine writing an o and then making a c in the middle
[kind of ugly] since I wrote it larger than usual
Capital Æ is mostly written like it looks on a PC
It's kind of awkward to do and I don't think I've ever seen it written prettily
Your handwriting is really strange
Is this how you were taught to write or just what it became over time
Do people from your country joke about reconquering a part of another
In Denmark, we joke about reconquering the Swedish counties of Skåne, Halland and Blekinge (mostly Skåne, as it is the closest to our mainland)
Yea, gib england and norway back please, North Sea Empire Stronk
Dude, don't even mention that to the Swedes
Before you know it they've given it back, and then we're stuck with Malmø on our side of the border
\*shudders*
I guees Germany will have a hard time relating to this
We also joke that Denmark should go to the river Eider in Germany again
Between 811 and 1864 it was our border to Germany
DANMARK TIL EJDER
I mean, no of course not
We're way too mature for that stuff
Is this also the case the other way around
I was so hoping there would be a German replying this question with exactly this type of answer
I hope you wrote it with a glint of humour in your eyes, and if not then I'm sorry for laughing dear neighbour
For the last time Greenland ISNT for sale
>:(  (we dont even own them, not really atleast)
Hey you fjeldaber
You ain't getting anything from us
You swedes broke it up probably because it was spearheaded by a danish monarch, why couldnt you guys just chill
We were THIS close to being a superpower
We will gladly restart the Kalmar Union, and resurrect its former glory
We can just petition Sweden
We get some, you get some, Finland gets some
I like the first idea better
If you wanna get more points, then get some better songs
And don't even start on that Brexit Idea
just kinda the same thing with Trump, we can't just fork it over, not ours to give
I'll go fetch the lederhosen and Rammstein records
France and Scotland talking about curb stomping England and Germany
Is The Auld Alliance about to be reinstated
Can we join
We still owe germany from the last time
I am from Denmark
Living in the Netherlands
With my Spanish girlfriend
I am suddenly very, very interested in watching the Eurovision the next time it rolls around
Merci mes amis
Well firstly, I never said it was a war only that we owed you for it
Secondly, you guys didn't even bother to declare war on us, so you're right it wasn't even a war
It was a cowardly suckerpunch
genuinely had no idea there was anything going on in Belarus, much less a protest or anything of the sort
The way you treat religion, in Denmark Religion is a private affiar, with a large majority being part of the state church so i guess there is very little religious debate, or discussion here
With the Atheists being the second most popular "Relgious affiliation" (yes i know Atheists take issue with that designation, but theres not really a good word for it besides that)
We also have significant overlap with Atheists, and Christians, with many being both
America is very preachy and adversarial, in regards to religion, all the Atheists i have met from the States are very anti church, to the point of being almost hatefull which i just don't get
Guns and Gun laws
Why
The contradictory opposition towards nudity, like, y'all have sex scenes in every fucking tv show, film and whatnot, but a toddler being naked, or just nudity in general, god forbid that
The lack of unions, like, no wonder your minimum wage hasn't gone up with inflation
Drinking laws
As a dane I am a little offended
That they wave a battle flag that stood for keeping slavery
It would be like if Germans had Swastika flying flags
I will never forget the time i ordered a ‘medium’ soda and it was like 0,8 L
One thing is having a flag outside, but you will occasionally see a video from an American classroom, and you'll *know* it's an American classroom because there's three separate flags in that *one room*.
Every country has kind people, just as every country has rude people
Americans aren't especially kind or rude, you guys just happen to be explicit with your emotions in public than many European countries deem appropriate
Also, your restaurant industries have been build so severs are relying on costumers' good-will in order to be able to make enough money to pay rent / eat the next day
This means you've cultivated a culture where the servers are overly friendly and enthusiastic
You are kidding yourself if you think they are like this because they are kind
It's fake, and that annoys Europeans who aren't used to it
There are many people that say they are Christian, and Atheists at the same time
Being members of the church, but not beliveing in god
I second this
Unions isn't politics, pff, it's the reason i earn a living wage
Sorry about that
It's just happens to be the most confusing part of Your lovely nation
its cheap and fast
The thing was bigger than any cup of soda I’ve seen here until recently
Just googled it
Burger king medium soda is 0,89 L.
McDonald’s is 0,62 L.
Wendy’s is 0,95 L.
The issue Only The lack thereof
Burger king large is 0,95L
McDonalds large 0,95L
Wendy’s 1,24 L
Just one thing slightly tangential
When \[insert Nordic country\] ranks as *Happiest Country in the World*, what it really means is *On Average Most Free From Material Worries* or something to that tune, not that we are giddy with joy and high on life, which Odin knows we ain't. Especially the British press had a bad habit of taking it a bit too literally
I am a Dane and I have lived and worked in a fair few countries
One of the things that Danes (and Scandinavians) probably don't realise, is how good their countries actually are
But if there is one thing we Danes have to deal with, it is having the most unpronounceable language in the world
Even the Norwegians and Swedes can agree on this
Things that personally bothers me:
- Postal service fucking sucks
I was shocked when I found out a lot of Europe has one day delivery for a lot of things
Here, it’ll take around a week if it’s from Denmark, around a month or very often more if it’s from outside of Denmark
“Sorry, we don’t ship to Denmark” is quite common
- Things such as food and clothes are expensive
For example, we don’t have a restaurant culture because it’s just too expensive
Most people don’t go out to eat more than once a month
Things like “bad” weather, apparently hard to make friends (have not lived anywhere else to compare), apparent “conformity-culture” (I live in a big city, whereas most of Scandinavia is very rural, I think this might play a role), not having any truly big cities with the biggest one being around 1-2 million - I’ve heard these from others but they don’t really bother me personally
Guess it’s a matter of taste
And also, something people in these threads never seem to talk about
of course it’s very difficult to be an immigrant anywhere
It’ll be hard having to deal with locals already having established social groups, learning the language, figuring out the bureaucracy, and so on and so forth
In Scandinavia as well
I can't think of anything only Scandinavians have to deal with
But I'm of course from Denmark and not Sweden
Maybe that people expect us to be perfect somehow
But we are just people trying to make it work without to many emotions ruining it
One thing I say about Denmark and probably Scandinavia in general: if you fit in the Scandinavian homogeneity, you'll love it
But if you don't, you might socially and culturally find it not as good as you hoped for
Very late to the party, and I don't think I've seen this mentioned, but as much as Scandinavia is touted as the most feminist area of the world, it's a bit of a problem since people take that to mean that there is no need to do better
In my experience as a Danish woman who happens to be not-entirely-white, Danish feminism has a loooooooong way to go as far as intersectionality is concerned
Even though my family background is as middle class as they come, due to health issues that have affected my ability to complete a uni degree and subsequently find work, I am also part of the financial underclass that mainstream feminists tend to ignore
Sure, we have a Queen and a female PM, as well as decent legislation surrounding parental leave and gendered discriminiation, but there are still so many instances of "everyday sexism" that refuse to die
A lot of the sexist tropes are perpetuated by women, too
Additionally, feminism is still a dirty word in Denmark as it's been cherry-picked and warped to be either an extreme form of misandry or an excuse for some women to make sexism work for them, instead of trying to eliminate the sexist frameworks in the first place
So yeah, being "the most feminist countries in the world" while still being sexist as hell is a pretty unique problem, I'd say
Denmark has been one of the happiest countries, but also one of the biggest consumers of antidepressants
IMO we're more like "The most contented country in the world
Is everything flowers and lollipops
Is everything pretty OK
Yea
I sleep very deeply, and I find it much easier to wake up in the morning when light comes in
Never sleep with my blinds down
It's funny, Norwegians go to Sweden, Swedes go to Denmark, Danes go to Germany, and Germans go to Poland, all in the pursuit of cheaper alcohol
I think it depends on the patient
In case of both my mother and my brother and other people I know how have suffered from cancer, treatment started immediately after they were diagnosed
Other stuff like hip-replacements can take a while
I mean I know we danes talk shit about you but I mean, we're ruddy neighbors eh
Although there are politics that we disagree on, i thinks Sweden is quite a nice country
Oh we can find you alright
One of the joys of being Scandinavian is feeling like kind of a rich person pretty much everywhere you go, even Japan, which reddit told me was shockingly expensive
In Japan you can get a decent meal for what gets you a hot dog at a gas station here
The thought that Scandinavians are shy is a misconception, we’re very private people who like to mind our own business
We’re tough to get to know, and that is a real struggle for many visitors and immigrants; but we make great friends if you make it through the barrier
Tf is Walpurgis night
We call it Sankthans in Denmark and it’s in June
We just make a cardboard witch and burn her at a giant bonfire, so she can fly (that’s the justification)
This just in, scandinavia still sexist as hell
>Additionally, feminism is still a dirty word in Denmark as it's been cherry-picked and warped to be either an extreme form of misandry or an excuse for some women to make sexism work for them, instead of trying to eliminate the sexist frameworks in the first place
There was a Guardian article recently where Denmark came out as the least feminist nation in the world because it had the least self-identifying feminists
Saudi Arabia taking the number 1 spot should probably have put the methodology into question maybe, but it does reveal this curious thing that even "progressive" women into women's rights don't care for the feminism label, and it weirds me out when my girlfriend (very left wing etc) rejects being called a feminist but clearly the word just has some baggage here that it doesn't have in many other countries, and it doesn't automatically translate to rejecting the ideas and struggles typically associated with feminism worldwide
Yup, there are places in Denmark where they don't see snow at all some years, and if they do, it'll most likely melt when it touches down
Relentlessly so
Found it
I think it is when the swedes put up their majsstang
It is near sankt hans
Denmark had border controls to Sweden even prior to the corona crisis in Sweden because of the crime wave of explosions and shootings in Sweden
Some Swedish criminals also exploded two bombs in Copenhagen
Yes
Grenades easier to get than fire arms
So the organized crime gangs use these instead
These gangs are mostly immigrants fighting for territories for the drugs an extortion
That’s why we call Malmö the Nordic Chicago
>I can imagine Copenhagen being better
People enjoy [Reffen] a lot or [Torvehallerne] Hija de Sanchez was actually "Best street food in Europe" in 2018
It's unlikely that heath care staff in Denmark don't speak English
They would minimum have had English in school
Perhaps your friends in Sweden met someone who for the first time had to use English at work and maybe was shy or something
>I believe only denmark has higher with 60%.
Denmark has a tax ceiling of 52%. The top bracket starts at 48,000 Danish kroner per month (66,000 Swedish)
I'm not sure how true it is but there's also this idea that it can be hard to travel in Spain if you get outside of the major tourist spots because of the language barrier
Would you say that's true
The reality is that a minority of Europeans speak Spanish after all so that could be part of the explanation I suppose
People simply don't learn an entirely new language to be able to go on summer holiday
Danish: bæ (or bae), meaning poop
English: bae, your boyfriend/girlfriend
Seems that most people missed the point of your question
They actually *are* related, both deriving from Proto-Germanic *bikwemaną. The semantic break is interesting, but not too complicated:
In Proto-Germanic, *bikwemaną could mean either "to happen", "to arrive at" or "to obtain, find".
So German basically kept the last meaning of "to obtain/get", whereas English kept the meanings of "to happen" and "to arrive", but added an additional meaning of "to turn into".
You can still see traces of the "to happen" meaning in English phrases such as "what became of him
", whereas the "to arrive" meaning is found in Shakespeare
I don't even live in a cpuntry that speaks their language, yet somehow it drowns out my country's news
I'm sure you know which countryI'm speaking of
I’ve been having this problem in a kinda twisted way
Every time I need to search something up in Portuguese, every single result is in Spanish
Let it be a recipe, word meaning, etc
Iceland because we have a meme beef with Norway and Sweden meaning I can’t support them in any way
Denmark or Germany, so I guess I'm pretty satisfied
Somewhere cold and rainy, I’d say the Scandinavian countries but i sadly can’t be seen supporting them in any way
Which leaves me with England
Iceland, fast internet and beautiful nature
Being an introvert this is the perfect place to suit my hermit life
Southern Germany/Austria
I know they’re not the same but I like the charm of living in the mountains in a decent sized town
I also like the German dialects
GERMANY
Definitely Deutschland
Denmark and below freezing don't go hand in hand
We've had like 3 days with below freezing this winter
It's barely been below freezing in Denmark this winter
The dark can be a bit depressing though
Winter in Denmark isn't below freezing temperatures anymore, at least not where I live
Global warming made sure of that
Disappointed you chose Sweden over Denmark or Norway
Norwegians are always welcome in Denmark, Swedes are a different topic tho
Wow, why
What made you fall in love
I’m interested
You’re always welcome to hit me up, if you decide you wanna learn the language
I’m a language lover who’s now learning his fifth European language, and i love to share my experiences with it
Danke schön!
Der findes ikke dårligt vejr, kun dårlige klæ’r :D
Don’t overestimate global warming, it’s a one degree difference
Are you saying that theres more accepting, understandig, and loyal friends in france
Im packing my bags, see yall in 16 hours
Danes are a tough group of people, to get to learn
You’d need a lot of courage to make it into a Danish friend group
Schnapps, beer and pork
Also: Take a break to enjoy the daylight when/if it's there
It's worth it for the incredible summer days though
That's about spot on
We have similar nature (except mountains) as a lot of Scandinavia, and we have a lot of the same architectural styles as the Netherlands
We also share the same bike culture
It's a snow/no snow difference
I love that Norwegians and Swedes buy beer in Denmaek, because it’s “cheap” but Danes buy beer in Germany because it’s “cheap”
Actually not
It’s about the same price in Germany and Poland
I was the opposite
Started talking to my dad about someone who’s baby cried
My dad said “she shouldn’t grab her like that” and a few other such criticism, until she said “sorry, she’s quite a handful” in perfect Danish
She was really nice and we ended up chit chatting a lot, but then I realized how rude it actually was
Not doing that again
Did the opposite
At a jazz Club in Vienna with our School
after a few beers my friends and I went to the toilet and we saw a Girl laying down ill, with people all around her
My friend comes with a stupid joke about her drinking to much to quick (“cold before 12” as we say in Denmark)
Her friend turns around and says in Danish, “no, she just forgot her medicine at the hotel”... turns out another Danish school was attending the same concert in the same small jazz club as us
really embarising
TIL that there are different decks of cards
And also, this explains something
My father plays L'Hombre (a very old Spanish card game) and you have to take out cards of the deck to get down to 40 cards
Now I understand that this is because the game was originally played with Spanish cards :D
Edit: A lot of people a speaking of 52 cards in the "French" deck - which is the one we use in Denmark
But isn't there only 51 cards in that one
12 in each of the four colors and 3 jacks
I knew the "normal" deck was called French, so that kind of implies that there are other types of decks from other countries or regions
But I have never seen or heard of any, until now
Except of course the UNO deck :-)
yeah no, literally never seen or heard of it before
>  l'hombre, how do you play it
I barely know
My daughter and I only asked him to teach us this summer
Found the rules for it
In Denmark its pretty dying
Only men 70-80+ play it
In many countries a variation of it called quadrille (or something) is more known
close enough
In Denmark, we translate Jack to Knægt and Queen to Dame
The King is the same word, but in Danish, Konge
That's already a rule in Denmark
though i dont recall how often they gotta pass
It's NOT an actual test though, it's more of a valuation by a doctor
he doesn't judge the persons ability to tell what to do in certain situations on the road
just weither or not he can hear/see properly
I'd like a proper license test, for EVERY SINGLE person with a license, every 5 years or so
so many people are terrible idiotic morons behind a wheel
It does not only depend on the temperature
E.g. if the temperature is 10 °C, but it's a gray rainy and windy day it is miserably cold here
But if the temperature is still 10 °C and the sun shines from a blue sky down on the snow covered landscape, and there is no wind, it can feel almost like summer
(But honestly, the latter scenario happens  once every 100 years here)
15 °C is warm, below it's jacket weather
25 °C is hot, and above that it's mostly unbearingly  hot and humid here
It depends
If it's windy or rains even a little bit, probably 10-15
If it's clear then 5
It was 10 degrees outside today, but the sun was out, so it was far too warm for anything but a t-shirt while working and maybe a thin long sleeved shirt when resting
Damn, 23-24 is our “wow it was soooo hot yesterday, like don’t get me wrong I like a good Summer day but I don’t hope it goes on for weeks”...
> You must have really dry weather,
We have an average humidity of like 200% or something, and rarely a day goes by, where the wind doesn't blow at least 5 m/s.
5 degrees can be absolutely bone chilling cold here
Hey fellow northerner
First word was blue for me too
Have you heard of seasonal depression
Because that honestly doesn’t sound normal
I never realized how accustomed I am to the darkness until now
We joke about winter depression here but it’s obviously very real
Try doing something that works better in the dark like watching movies or reading by candlelight, and remember to take vitamin D supplements if you feel like you’re not getting enough sunlight
A Danish poet wrote that the year has 15 months
January, February, March, April, May, June, Juli, August, September, October, November, November, November, November and December
I start loosing my mind a little bit in February and forget that is was ever nice and warm outside
In Danish we say "store nosser"  which means big balls and is synonymous with being brave
We also say "lange nosser"  which means long balls and is synonymous with something unpleasant, annoying or otherwise negative thing happening to you
Closest is [this] (today's risky click
But really I don't think we use the term in Danish
Our best one is "at nosse sig sammen" = "to balls yourself together" (doesn't make literal sense in Danish either), when you gotta pull yourself together and do that thing you're supposed to
Don’t we just say to have balls in general
Siger man ikke normalt "lange løg" i stedet for "lange nosser"?
Yeah you're right, I think I'm using too much danglish in my every day life
Jeg har hørt begge dele, men da jeg stod i lære som maskinarbejder lærte jeg en del farverige udtryk hvoraf et af dem var "Det er lige til at få dårlig pik og lange nosser af
Fin means pretty, dude
You too
The only bad thing I've heard about Switzerland (excluding potential political differences etc
as is a potential problem with every country on the planet) is the claim that Swiss people are supposedly rude
However, that claim usually comes from Americans or Southern Europeans who are used to that very "outwardly social" mentality, small talk etc
and they say the same about all of Northern Europe, Central Europe and Eastern Europe so it seems more like it's them being the outliers and not everyone else
So to what extent the "Swiss people are rude
" thing is true or not I have no idea
If "rude" simply means a more reserved or "Let's not bother other people for no reason" mentality like in Germany, Denmark etc
I don't see that as rude at all and certainly not as a bad thing
I enjoy not being "bothered" when I'm just out and about in public, just because I'm going shopping doesn't mean I'm interested in talking to every random person I see on the way there
I would rather retire in Medellin Colombia
Switzerland is too expensive
I voted for a candidate of the party I support because I respect him deeply
He is charismatic, trustworthy and important for me, he is young
He's fighting for better school systems, and kids in general
If I could only vote for something I believed in, my vote vould never be cast as I really don’t have any significant trust or faith in any candidate or party
We call it “politikerlede” or “dislike of politicians” here
Instead I vote “defensively”.
That is ... who is MOST LIKELY to win that I ABSOLUTELY DON’T want to win
Then I vote on whoever stands a chance at denying that first candidate or party a win
I suppose that places me in the “lesser evil” camp
Dont really agree 100% with any of the politicians, so i just vote for the one i am closest to, unless there's someone with a hilarious name, then he/she has deserved it
Can I ask who it was
Jacob Mark from SF
The danish youth smokes the most out of all Nordic countries, or atleast out of all Scandinavian countries, I don’t remember
Some 20-25 percent of the population smokes (it varies a bit from year to year, since it mostly decreases, but has actually increased again)
Smoking is very much correlated to people's social inheritance and class, though
I work at a high school - i.e. a place where most employees are academics - and to my knowledge, less than 5 out of approx
85 employees smoke
On the other hand, I've lived at a dorm and noticed that the majority of people who came from working class families smoked like chimneys, especially when they hung out with each other
The latter seems to be a general tendency in friend groups (and to a somewhat slighter degree in families) - either everyone smokes or no-one smokes
The question is more about the increase of snus in Denmark
I go to the Sanish equivalent of high school where snus is everything
My principality have issued, as of today, no smoking at all during school even outside school grounds
Every smoker who want to be more discreet is probably going to use snus more often since it's easier to hide
[That’s exactly the same pattern as here
] They’re about to raise the price thankfully
I understand that a large portion of the decrease in smokers is due to taxation and public sentiment, but how much would you wager that the use of snus, especially among young people, has affected smoking rates
Cause at least in Denmark, snus has been getting bigger and bigger since the mid 2010's, so much so that it has helped decrease the amount of youths who smoke
This sounds very good
But snüs consumption is still VERY high in Norway, and that’s unhealthy af still
The only "positive" thing to happen in recent years in regards to youth smoking, is the rise in prevalence of snus
At least we're getting addicted to something which doesn't directly cause cancer now lol
wow so the cool thing is to skate and wear baggy clothes
that sounds unfortunate
Yes, I guess, the last one is pretty unfortunate
Hahah, thats true, some people I know both smoke and take snus
Snus is still pretty awful afaik - a friend of a friend had to get surgery because his gums were practically rotting from using the stuff
Probably still better as it doesn’t affect the people around you like smoking does though
Very popular among youth in Denmark as well
The ones sold in super markets and gas stations are tobacco free versions with added nicotine to circumvent the EU ban
And it's also quite popular to drive to Sweden and buy a bunch to sell in Denmark
Kinda like Norway with driving to Sweden/Denmark for cheap alcohol
If you are already addicted to nicotine you'll probably like it
wow no, an average (cheap) cigarette pack costs 55dkk (AUD$12) and next year theyre gonna increase it to 65dkk (AUD$16)
They just raised the taxes so a pack went from 6 euros to around 8
Don't think you are allowed to advertise for tobacco here
A bit surprised it isn't an EU wide ban
yeah i know someone that puts three sachets in at a time
he is partly swedish tho ;)
You're right, it is still very unhealthy and should be avoided
Yet something can be said for the fact that it doesn't cause cancer (that we know of)
Gum surgery, as much as it probably sucks, has a hellll of a lot higher survival rate than cancer
really
because we can buy it here everywhere
actually NOBODY dresses like that
thats some cringe ass shit
Makes more sense then hahah
i get them mixed up all the time
fucking hate it when you go to take out your vape but it turns out it's an e-meth
be careful
Since you're from Hamburg, a tip if you wanna try snus, is that you can actually buy it in basically any gas station in Denmark
It's not with tobacco, since u know, illegal in the EU, but it's the "tobacco free" versions which taste and feel the same, and the brands are all Swedish
The reason for this, is that snus is insanely popular not only in Sweden, but Denmark and Norway too
In Copenhagen people often drive across the bridge to Sweden and load up on thousands of kr
worth of snus, and sell it back in Denmark
Either it is tobacco-free, or it is illegal
If you for example go to [one of the biggest snus sites online,] it will inform you that you need to switch to the EU site
On there, they only sell nicotine pouches, as these are not banned by the EU, and are not ***technically*** snus, as it is not tobacco
Nicotine pouches and snus are pretty much the same thing, and the words are used interchangeably
Both are the same concept, a flavored way of delivering nicotine in a pouch under the lip
Only difference is lack of tobacco, and legality in the EU
I remember seeing someone a while ago asking if it was worth it to move from USA to Switzerland for a certain job
Was that you
Stop calling it a Danish
It's a fucking atrocity
Also, it's not an "open faced sandwich", it's fucking smørrebrød
When tourists pronounce Copenhagen as Kopenhagen as if we are Germans
We are not Germans and we don't sound alike
These are pretty funny
But also kinda justified with some of them
I gagged at the Cinnamon buns with cream cheese
Obviously, you guys are enjoyable
Never really understood this mentality regarding my fellow Danes
It’s so silly to discuss wether Finland is Scandinavian or non-Scandinavian as we are very much alike - despite our languages that is
How come it annoys Finns being called Scandinavian
I love the Finns’ culture and country but I won’t have any of that Finland is Scandinavian nonsense
In Denmark your country’s name is literally Holland
And it gets really really weird as a Dane when I realized holland was a region or place
Nederlandene would probably be correct to use but on the maps it’s literally holland
As well as the football name and such
This also annoys me to great extents
When I see someone online be like "Oh I'm actually Danish", I like to respond with something in Danish and wait for their confused reply as to which language I just wrote in
I’ve never heard about it, what is it about
Never heard about that “joke” before
Also ""Danish'es"" aren't even fucking Danish, they're Austrian
(Er det ikke dem vi kalder for spandauer
No sauce
Why
I don’t really care
If they want to be Scandinavians they can be, and if they don’t, I still thinks it’s totally fine
>  Finland is geographically in Scandinavia¨
Scandinavia isn't a geographical region, it's a cultural one
Finland is not within that cultural region
Didn't Americans also start celebrating "Leif Ericcsons Day" instead of Colombus day for some weird reason
We also use "Holland" for the country, and "Hollændere" for the people as well
It's so annoying and I don't know if you've experienced this but then when you talk about Danish culture or something they have no idea what you're talking about
Ja, det er den amerikanske version af en spandauer
I was purely talking about in terms of language
Danish is not that close to German as some tourists might believe, and our capital is not pronounced as such
This is like calling every slavic person a Russian since they are of slavic ethnicity
Ethnicity =/= Nationality
Also, Germanic =/= German
Danes are Germanic, yes, but not German
That is a weird way of saying mountain-monkies
I did struggle with putting out a comprenhesible sentence I must admit
It’s at least better than being called Russian, right
No we aren't!
Don’t forget the Faroe Islands and Greenland, unless you just meant to include them in “Denmark”
Oh now I get it
I’ve never looked at the name that way
Thanks for explaining
I thought it was referring to a famine, like under the Soviets or something
Reminds me of the Penguins from Madagascar: "just smile and wave boys, smile and wave"
Geesh, wait till someone tells this guys that Iceland isn't a part of Scandinavia either
But why
I honestly see both you and the baltic countries as part of the nordic countries
I've heard it's an Austrian pastry, which just thickens the plot even more
Close, very close my Irish friend
My girlfriend is Mexican and everyone I meet in Mexico makes that kind of joke XD
I don't.
Why not
Well, they're simply not nordic, they have a completely different historical and cultural backgrounds as countries
Fair enough honestly
I respect that
We tend to take things way too lightly compared to other countries
I didn't know that Denmark had the 4th longest coastline in the world (when counting Greenland and the Faroe Islands)
In Danish it’s appelsin, same meaning
Moldova can only dream of the day it can afford to take that title
I just joined the subreddit today
How do I obtain a flair if you don't mind me asking
It depends on where you sunbathe - on the beach in Jylland (Danish mainland) many sunbathe topless, but I've noticed that in and around Copenhagen, many don't. I suspect it's because of population density, among other things
Personally, I sunbath topless if I notice other people are doing it as well, and I've never felt like it was weird or odd to do so
But depending on where I did it, I was either in the minority or majority
When I was a child I feel like everybody did it though - my mum, grandmother, aunts, strangers - nobody wore tops
From what I've seen in Southern Zealand, Denmark, it is at most 3-4 for women, and 80% for overweight men
In Scandinavia 0,1%
I'd say maybe around 5% or less
It's not unheard of
I guess that British guy is just a hornball who see one girl topless and focuses on them, not noticing the rest lol
That's definitely one likely reason but prudishness or something like that may also explain some of it
I don't know the numbers for Denmark but media has covered it more than once going back more than a decade, before mobile phones and digital cameras became widespread
Something else may be at play
Even if we just look at recent years I'm not sure everything can be explained by fear of peeping toms taking fotos
One related phenomenon in Denmark is that people don't want to use communal showers as much as before
I'm sure there's always been some that never enjoyed that but apparently in the recent decade or so more and more students skip gym class or just change clothes without showering
It also affects  communal showers at private gyms/fitness centers and public swimming pools
It's more an issue among women but also men, and not only younger people though more so
The change has been attributed to, among other things, social media and the need to keeping up appearances
Whatever the reason something has changed how some people perceive partial or full nudity in public or semi public situations
Not convinced it's an issue needing a solution though, except perhaps if it negatively affects some people in various ways if they lack a positive body image (oh and the expenses related to building private showers I guess)
Society's views on things change
Yeah it might be a change going that far back
Though I'm sure cameras in recent years have accelerated any longer term trend or societal norm
Take a look at the Swedish comments
We celebrate those things too
In Denmark there were a lot of holidays in late Spring because of crop-harvesting and some religious holidays
Later this got too much since we had stopped being a heavy farming country and so they made "Store Bededag" (Grand Prayers Day) which is essentially a mix of all the many holidays we had in April, May and early June
In Denmark we have the same tradition, but in the midsummer
Most places make a toy witch to burn on the fire, to make a replication of the witch-burnings in the middle ages
However the day is called Saint Hans Night, named after John the baptist
We celebrate it too, in denmark :)
Yeah, Sankt Hans aften in June
We put a witch on there, usually made by school children
[Villy Søvndal, our former foreign minister is probably the most famous one
We used to have a Minister called Willie Søvndal
I believe he was then Minister of foreign relations
He barely spoke English, and his terrible speeches are still joked about today
He is actually still politically active, and I think I saw something about him running for mayor of my city at one point
Came here to post this
Was my thought too, but its also difficult to blame people of his generation to suck at english
Sure, and they do have interpreters with them when meeting with representatives from other countries anyway
Still, if you are going to be the minister of foreign affairs and actually give presentations in English, you might want to practice a bit more
Happy cake day by the way
Oh, didnt even notice, haha, thats one year on reddit for me lol
And well, its well documented that its more difficult to learn as you get older, and Villy was not exactly young by any means
The dude meant well and had a good message, but yeah he sounded hillarious speaking english
Like there is the things the vikings did, but if i didn't get to choose that then i would say the Stockholm Bloodbath is pretty high up there
In 1951 Denmark conducted an experiment, where "we"1 forcefully removed 22 kids from their families in Greenland
As far as I can tell, it was an attempt to "Educate the savages".
They where put in an orphanage, taught Danish and sent to Danish school
Some where adopted, but most stayed in the orphanage
They never returned to their families
The experiment was a horrible failure
I was under the impression that it was a lot more than 22, but it's still terrible
This is simply not true
The conditions on Greenland were so bad, that child mortality was very high because of tuberculosis among other thing
Red Cross wanted to help children that was already taken from their families because of bad conditions by sending them to a Danish foster care
This happened with the accept of the local Inuit leadership on Greenland and it was so attractive that more well-off Inuit families made sure to have their children enrolled in the Red Cross program
More here: [Google translate]
I think "simply" is the wrong word
There's several different views on the matter
Google translate won't work on this link on my phone, but there's more of the same
> There's several different views on the matter
Yes, some are historical, others are political/sensational
goed
Child porn was legal for ten years
Granted, it was primarily because of a loophole in the law -we were the first country to legalize and industrilize porn, and nobody really thought to make an additional law against porn with children when sex with them was already illegal
But many, including respected politicians opposed a ban
Something about pedophiles needing outlets and "well, sometimes they're not REALLY hurting them
We occupied Norway for four hundred years, and just to rub it in we called it a "union". Fun times (except for Norway)
As many other European nations we did a lot of bad stuff during the slave trade years
I'll instead tell you about something more recent
In the 1950's 22 Greenlandic kids were sent to Denmark,
as an initial experiment to see if it were possible to better educate native Greenlandics
What initially was meant as a one year educational thing, instead ended up looking more like something akin to ethnic cleansing
Instead up coming home to their parents, the kids were either put up for adoption or sent to a foster home
The kids were forbidden from speaking Inuit and were attempted stripped of their Greenlandic identity as much as possible
Many of the kids from the experiment died young and the once that did not were left with severe emotional trauma
This is surely not the worst thing to happen in the history of Denmark, but the fact that it happened in the 50's shortly after the atrocities of WW2 makes me look at it a pretty horrible thing
Start with the real bad stuff:  The Reliant Robin
1807 ya meanies
> Hoo boy where to start
Cliff Richard
You only lost a battle, the treasonous colonials can still be brought back under the crown
First, it took some time for people to even kind of be aware that it was a thing
Porn was still taboo
One politician randomly discovered it by walking by a porn cinema one day
Second, a lot of people were afraid to mess with foreign countries like that
The majority of the underage porn was produced in other countries such as Thailand and the Philippines and then sold here
"We can't control what other countries do".
Third -the scariest one- we were just fucking hippies
Or a lot of people were
The sexual revolution was happening and on steroids, and some felt that children to varying degrees were a natural part of that
Things like having "fucking rooms" in hippie community where children were allowed to watch their parents
No talk about boundaries, no #Metoo
A LOT of adults were also sexually assaulted in this boundary-free time
It should be as "free" and "natural" as possible
Some advocated as I said that nude pictures or soft core child porn were "just playing with them naked" and "they don't even understand what's happening" and "we're just encouraginh them to be comfortable with their bodies".
Well its only in 2015 that we banned bestiality, so a lot of the opposition to that law still are
> Likewise with Norway and Denmark
I don't know if we ever had such a programme
We should have, as there still are too many retards around here
Like you
>Ah, no can do, they need to pay us back first
Pay you back
Does Germany not still own Greece WWII reparations
No, I am super smart
So kind of the opposite
We have something similar in Denmark
Except we burn a witch on a big bonfire, and then we sing some songs about it
We still practice the tradition of Jul or (Yule in old Nordic/German ) in Denmark
It was just adopted by christianity
We still use pagan traditions like “Nisser” and “Goat” and “Julefrokost” all part of ancient traditions
Sankt Hans, maybe
It is the same as celebrating midsummer, but you burn a witch-doll on a bonfire
The town I live in used to burn a bunch of (what they deemed to be) witches back in the middle ages
Edit: Bonfire
Is Lucia a pagan tradition
I always thought it had it's roots in Christianity
Don't forget the thorsfejde
Don’t know about that
That must be a swedish thing
So would that be before or after the snaps
My father’s brother always did this after the snaps and the fist fight just kept going till the last of them was down ( by the way 5 brothers)
A Dane that can't ride a bicycle and drink a beer
A Dane who doesn't like rye bread
That is bordering treason
A Dane who don't enjoy hygge
A dane that doesnt live in a house of lego
A Dane who doesn’t like coffee
Didn't realize all of Scandinavia was high on that list lol
Same here
Same here
At the same time
Im pretty sure it's illegal to drink while riding a bike anyway
Let's hang out and not drink together then
Cheers
I know a surprisingly high amount of people that hate coffee
>Im pretty sure it's illegal to drink while riding a bike anyway
No, as long as you can drive safely [it's okay
It is perfectly legal to drink a beer while driving a car or riding the bike
As long as you are below the alcohol limit and you are still able to drive safely
Yea
They are probably from swedish decent
Fucking Sweden
Lies
We don't get cold weather
>As long as you are below the alcohol limit
There is not an alcohol limit on bike
But you need to be able to dive safely or else you are fined 1,500 kr
What do you mean
Coffee is isn't culturally big here at all
Nothing's a bad excuse if you can blame the danes ;)
En sol (common/utrum)
En måne (common/utrum)
If I had to assign them genders, I would say that the sun was female, and the moon male
In Danish both are common gender: _solen_, _månen_.
We have two different neutral “genders”. Both sun and moon are -en, which is the most common one
About 70% of words are -en and 30% are -et
Solen = The sun, is Together-gender, and so is Månen = The moon
Neither are our other gender, which is called genderless
Solen (the Sun) and månen (the Moon) are Both neutral, as it should be
We were in Hamburg, Germany
On our last day we went to the parking place where our car was, and driving out of there a van had parked blocking the exit
Looking behind the van was like 8 guys with masks and guns about to do a full on robbery, so we just floor it and drive around the van
Very weird experience
We where somewhere in Croatia
I was five or so and it was my first vacation outside of Denmark
We where sleeping in a tent we rented
First night we rented tent but at around midnight a porcupine gets into our tent and into the mattresses
We get a new tent
On our last night it rains heavely and our tent gets flood
Because we couldn't get a new tent we drive to a nearby town and stay there
On our way home out of the city my dad opens a window while we drive over a huge puddle
I was right in the path of the water and gets my last dry clothes wet
It was a horrible trip home
was in Sarajevo in Bosnia Herzegovina
to be fair, the trip itself was awesome and something i would like to do again
but we were stopped at the border because we forgot some of the papers for the car
after some back and forth, the officer there told us that he was gonna go inside the building again, and when he came back my dad would give him his passport again
my dad got the hint, slipped a couple hundred euros (dont remember the exact amount) into the passport and gave it to the officer
now, the officer then took the passport, went directly over to an officer with a bigger fancier hat than him and gave him the passport
my dad thought he was gonna go to jail for bribing a border officer
but after some time the first officer came back with the passport and said there were no problems and we could get into the country
the money inside the passport was gone too
best part, my dad only told me once we were home from vacation
I don't really have any bad stories about traveling in Europe, it's all been pretty great so far
I saw a local guy get beaten by police once but that was in Tunisia so that doesn't count
No clue what that was all about
The worst thing that has happened to me on a vacation happened right here in Denmark, and it's not really much of a horror story, just bad luck
When I was like 10 years old or something I was at the beach on a day where the underwater visibility was very low, so I was diving right along the bottom so I could see any potential crabs or whatever down there
At some point I look up and see something red ahead of me
I couldn't see what exactly it was so I decided to surface to try and avoid it but since I still had some forward momentum I ended up going face first into a big ass jellyfish and I got stung pretty fucking badly
First all over the face, then it continued to slide down along my stomach, and then down my legs and feet
That was some serious fucking pain but luckily it didn't last too long
I was okay and "functioning" again by evening
Hmm, one of my best vacations was in that area but that was quite a few years ago
Maybe it's been "damaged" by overtourism since then
When I was there it was all nice and relaxed and the locals were super nice to a kid like me, the hotel was nice etc
When did you go there
I think we saw police with sirens like 15 minutes later
We were mostly focused on leaving
Ohh yeah
Yeah stuck in our tent and we couldn't get it out
In my city Aalborg we have hvis statue of a bull
It's a city landmark and sits right in the middle of the most used street
Thousand of people pass right by it every day
A couple of years ago some guy from Copenhagen came forward saying he had stolen a sword from the statue, 16 years prior  while on a bender in the city, and he had been too afraid of telling anybody about it since
Nobody in the whole city had noticed that it was missing until he cam forward
Edit: I don't know if it was clear that what he stole was a sword which was part of the statue
And it was facing right at alle the people passing

man
if I could give money in order to never hear that name again, I would
Sincerely,

They were in western Europe, parts of France and western Denmark, i believe
Odense in Denmark, has good hotels, good food and is a lovely place
The whole [island of Fyn] is more or less ignored by many tourists
We mostly get Germans with camping vans/trailers and Chinese who want to see HC Andersen stuff
Most tourists skip the island and either go to Copenhagen or Aarhus
But Fyn has some 'off the beaten path' attractions and some of the "least crowded" beaches and museums
Lots of smaller cities you can fully explore in a day
Decent size forests (by Danish standards) you can also explore easily in a day or camp overnight if you want to
Just been in Nove Mesto nad Metuji and at the Adrspach rocks
Great stuff
German is for sure the go to Language if you wish to work in Europe, since it is not only the primary Language in Germany, Austria, Liechtenstein and Switzerland, it is also a second/third Language for northern european countries and eastern european countries, which makes german a Very good Language to learn second to english ofc
Depends on the job
I interact with a lot of eastern european truck drivers (mainly romanian, latvian, lithuanian and bulgarian people) so russian would be great for me
The language of whereever you're living
That seems pretty obvious unless I misunderstands the question
Depends a lot on what the CCP wants to do
The "rich" countries have had their economic development basically stagnante, meanwhile Asian and African countries are doubling their economy in 5-10 years
One can't deny the growth and influence that Asia will have in the future and you definitely can't deny the potential for Mandarin to be the lingua franca
Not true, most jokes are against Sweden
Most *language* jokes are against us
> That apparently the Danish are like the butt of every *language joke told by other Scandinavians
This is Swedish propaganda
I use olive oil for Southern cuisine and butter for more Northern things
Canola oil when Asian and/or I’ve given up in life
Every time there's a "how do you say X in your language" I find a Norwegian/Swedish comment and don't bother with the "same" anymore
It's the same on r/etymologymaps \- what's the word for cheese
ost, ost and ost in Scandinavia, okay (Iceland coming in with "ostur" or something)
Obviously no surprise our languages are similar, but they're *really* similar
> Finns used to ride logs on rivers and pre-christianity believed vaginas had magical powers
Sure
"pre-christianity"
They sleep so well in the cold
Especially if it’s a bit windy
My son could sleep an extra hour outside, when it was really cold (in Iceland)
You’re right
I could write a whole rambling about how tired I am of the potato jokes and how I feel like they may legitimately hurt our language but I’m too tired
That’s a new one
Butter is great if you want a buttery taste
For most things I use rapeseed oil
Oh no, they don't want to be Baltic but they're considered that
They 100% wants to be nordic which they are not considered
And then he said “Danish sounds like someone is speaking with a potato in their mouth
Funniest shit I’ve ever seen
>(Don't mention nynorsk, let it die)
Its funny that there are so varied beliefs on Nynorsk
But yeah, it's a weird language based on some guy travelling to small remote random villages and declaring their version of Norwegian to be the "true" Norwegian
Anyway, according to Wikipedia it is in decline and has been so for some time
Haha, you win :D danified Finns, bwahaha
Remember that one time some US right wingers got in a meme fight with r/sweden
That had me laughing for a full week
Probably the latter
But all the same, it’s enjoyable for our Nordic offspring
No worries, it’s not you guys’ fault primarily
But as someone who enjoys linguistics, it kind of feels like you’re cursed with an ugly language
It’s to the point where even Danes are being raised with the “Germanic languages are ugly, Romance languages are pretty” beauty standards
I very rarely hear any kind of appreciation for Danish, even by Danes themselves (unless badly translating memes count), and I’ve heard “why don’t we just switch to English lol” more than once
As a joke, but still
Sometimes I really wish my first language was French or Spanish, having a lot of people learning it and thinking it’s beautiful
Anecdotal I know, but both my big sister and little sister put their babies to sleep outside, and neither is an outdoorsy type at all
I’ve heard a danish woman in her 50s saying we should switch to English
I laughed, but then realised she was deadly serious
I know an Icelandic girl who finds danish sexy (especially English with a danish accent)
So there’s that
I find beauty in the huge variations in the different dialects around the country
> Sometimes I really wish my first language was French or Spanish
Sometimes I have that same thought, but then I remember that only 6 million people on the planet speak it, which is 0,08% of the world population
I find it kind of beautiful and unique to know such a small language
Well
I don't know
I don't care about the Latin languages, but if Danish sounded a bit more like Norwegian then that would nice
"Danes have a funny sounding language" was not a thing internationally before internet meme culture
The fact that it has become a meme at all is testament to Sweden's strong presence online
I'm almost proud of my brothers
Sweden is by far the biggest one of the Scandinavian countries
It makes sense it would get chosen as a nationality for a character for children’s show from another continent over Denmark
Very often I see things that are basically just Swedish getting lumped onto us as well
Like how all of Eastern Europe are seen as “basically Russia”.
> So how come it's the Swedish chef and not Danish chef on the muppets of the Danes have the weird language
Oddly enough that character is called the Danish Chef in the German version of The Muppet Show
I'm not sure why they changed it
Free world class healtcare, free schools and universities, high pay, wide and strong social security rate - probably
>especially English with a danish accent
That's just cursed
Ej mange tak
Det er enormt sødt
Er du i Danmark eller lærer du det bare for sjov
It certainly would be a secret language
You can (with some precautions) talk openly about whatever you want when traveling abroad
I think you’re right about a lot of things, but I do think language speakers have very different amounts of pride in their language
Similarly to how a lot of Italians and Frenchmen and Spaniards are really proud of their cuisine, just turned up to a ten
Sure we have some pride in our frikadeller, but not nearly enough as the French have in their regional cuisine
I guess years and years of bullying the Swedes has come back to haunt us
Denmark saved so many jews, and it was mainly doable thanks to sweden - gotta admit that
That's almost the Danish winter
Although it's usually a bit warmer - so that you can get drenched in 1 degrees cold water which the wind sweeps straight into your bones
I think it is pretty universal for non-english speakers to dislike English with their native accent
I personally hate English with a Danish accent
Norway gets all the attention internationally though
I never see Denmark mentioned :'(
That is a hilarious comment
But they absorb the gløgg, and swell up and become little morsels of sweet happiness
You could at least help us this time around
I like Icelandic English, even though I’m a native speaker (it can get a bit cringe if people overdo it, though)
Du har kun lavet en enkelt fejl, som rigtig mange danskere også lavet hele tiden - nogen vs nogle
Nogen er ental, nogle er flertal
Dit dansk er nydeligt, fortsæt det gode arbejde
I'm strongly considering putting the Christmas lights up around the house
It's getting darker now, and I really like a bit of light in the dark months
Not even the ones that have been soaking in rum for a few months before they're added to the glögg
I would say Corfitz Ulfeldt
The reason Denmark lost Skåne Halland and Blekinge
I’m sorry, but any sane person would say Pavelic, atleast between those two
Funny thing is, Danes have absolutely no idea who he is
> When I team up with Romanians in Counter Strike, I somehow always ask them what they think about Ceausecu
That's some downright strange servertalk
> Funny thing is, Danes have absolutely no idea who he is
Of course we do
He was a bad king here as well,. There is a reason that he was imprisoned for the rest if his life
Well I know that I don’t have the knowledge of croat, on this topic
But I have read alot about both Tito and Pavelic, and therefor I wrote that, but I’m sure you as a croat, know something that I don’t.
I never claimed he was a good man
quality small-talk right there
>I always learned in my history class that you called him Christian the good
Swedish propaganda I guess
Maybe
It is certainly not true
&#x200B;
He was extremely unpopular in Denmark
He introduced a new lawcode, and it was promptly burned publicly in Viborg just to spite him
Then he was kicked out of Denmark, and later imprisoned for more than 25 years when he returned
To me it sounded like an angry rebuttal (e.g. "*how dare you make a light-hearted comparison out of this terrible man
*") but I wasn't sure
That's why I added the question mark because I didn't want to offend him
Grammar - not that hard
Pronunciation - I honestly have never even seen someone that didn’t live here from childhood that sounded even close to native
From my experience teaching Danish at the Danish learning Discord server, and experience from living here
Grammar + vocab = Pretty easy
Pronunciation: I have yet to be fooled by anyone
Especially the Danish 'stød' is awful to learn as well as the soft d's
I've met like, maybe 2 or 3 people, who could ALMOST pull it off
They were all Dutch
This guy is pretty good:
True, my Norwegian grandmother lived here for 40+ years, she still didn’t sound native
I love German grammar
And the language, too
Every time I hear the potato or kamelåså joke I die a little inside because it’s so old
However, then I remember it’s because the rest of Scandinavia hasn’t produced any original humor for a couple of decades, so I forgive them
I’m impressed if someone knows one word of Danish
Yeah
I can tell when I'm listening for it that he's not a native, but I'm not sure I'd realise he's a foreigner if I just met him and didn't know
I've heard that before too, I even heard that some people were confused why a guy like Jan Heintze never played for the Dutch national team, because they never realised he wasn't Dutch
There's something about how he pronounces his e's and the word "uddannelse" (and a few other sounds/words) that would sound a bit foreign to me even if I didn't know
But yeah, otherwise I haven't heard any other adult learner speak as relatively accent-free as this guy
Yeah we don’t really care about Norway
Bullying [Sweden] is [where it’s at]
Fewer hours would create more jobs though
They would pay less, but still
Nederlands electronic music
They are literally pioneers in EDM, and so many events there too
It's a cool culture there
also Hagelslag
Although liking Swedish products is treason, every Dane does it
Gifflar, Marabou, Malaco candy, Pågen and many more
Thanks Germany for cheap Candy and Soda across the border
I give thnaks to all of the entene for winning ww1, we were neutral, and afterwards in 1920 we could have an election in Schleswig-Holstein to allow self determination, I dont think A Germany not within serious civil trouble would have let their northern part go, no matter how many danes lived there
Thank you norway for being awesome
Thank you Canada for the best war ever
Thank you sweden fo- wait what
Jokes aside, thank you sweden for helping us save the danish jews in ww2
It was just before Christmas
of course we've got your back
I'm pretty sure we ran out of yeast in quite recent history where we got offered supplies (yeast) by Norway
Also billar
And thank you for the whisky
For everyone else who doesn't know about the Canadian-Danish war, here is some completely neutral information:
You mean the danish Hans Island
Thank you for the best war ever
Let us be an example for the rest of the world
Not trying to steal any thunder from our Norwegian buddies, but I think I speak for pretty much everyone in the Nordics when I say that we all like Scotland very much
If you guys ever separate from the rest of the UK and get real independence, you will be a welcome new member in the Nordic council if you wish
Just don't tell Estonia
As a Dane - I'm sorry for a messy breakup
We weren't able to protect you during WW2, and we completely understand that you wanted to be independent
No hard feelings from this side - and unless we are playing against each other, all Danes always cheer for Iceland in international football or handball matches
Oh, you can buy them everywhere in Denmark
Gifflar is likely the most beloved Swedish product in Denmark
Gifflar is no match for the mighty Citronmåne from Dancake
My brother-in-law and his family lived in Toronto for 6 months a couple of years back and enjoyed it very much
I have never been there myself, but I while I can't say anything bad about Canada, I must admit I also struggle to remember anything else than maple syrup when thinking about canadian products
Oh yeah, and the Canadarm
Personally, I think it would be pretty cool to just split the island down the middle
That way we can both have a second land border
Yes, yes it is
The canadians and the danes figured out the proper way to do war
Gifler IS better - there I said it, I feel dirty and will face any consequences of my actions
I can understand a little Swedish and Norwegian, but not much
For a long time, I wasn't really able to tell the difference between Norwegian and Swedish
All I knew was, that if I had little trouble understanding it, it was most likely Norwegian
If it was a bit harder to understand, then it was most likely Swedish
But I wasn't able to put my finger on why one was easier than the other
Then the company I worked for was bought by a Norwegian company and I started talking a lot with them
I think I am pretty good at understanding Norwegian now, even from people who live pretty high up north
Swedish is still pretty hard if they don't slow down
Reading both Norwegian and Swedish is easy though
Icelandic is impossible and Faroese
no idea
I have never been exposed to it, and the few Faroese people I have met spoke Danish perfectly
It’s funny because as a Dane, I can understand 75% of written Dutch, but once they start talking
no clue, maybe 20%. And that’s from a Dane: our language is just as much a potato in the mouth as Dutch
> both Norwegian and Swedish is easy though
Icelandic is impossible and
Dude
Me too
I'm danish from CPH and lived half a year in Trondheim
The locals would be so sad when I told them that I had no idea if they were speaking Norwegian or Swedish
Faroese both looks and sounds to me like a Danish person trying to write/speak Icelandic, which really hurts my head, since I still barely understand any more of it than Icelandic
I'd say written Faroese is *slightly* easier than written Icelandic though, since it isn't quite as grammatically complex
Well
from the Danish side I think most people (or at least the younger generations) have completely forgotten that you guys where once part of the Kingdom
We generally love all of our Northern brethren, except the Swedish of course
Daily/semi-daily in the traditional news media
More than hourly if you browse r/popular
The biggest stories in our news media are rarely if ever about the US though
Our media is pretty good at keeping things grounded to Danish/european news and only mentioning American events in passing
It would definitly help if every little thing he does wasn't so damn stupid  I think news in general have a tendency to focus primarily on the negative, and right now there's definitly a lot of negatives in the US
The worst part is that the entire discourse has fallen to that level, trump said something stupid, so let's find the dumbest comment on that stupid statement possible to get the most outrageous headline
"Trump believes rakeing leaves will put out all forest fires" "Fires are inevitable and no amount of forest ordinance and maintenance could minimize them". It always has to be the most uninformed and extreme person
I agree with the\_pianst91 and the same applies for Denmark
I follow developments in Belarus pretty closely and each Sunday 1-200
000 pro-democracy protesters march and we hardly hear about it
But if 2000 BLM-supporters march in Portland
I think it has to do with language, accessibility and self-reinforcing effect
Every journalist here is pretty fluent in English and news about English-speaking countries is very easy to access from the source
We are also way overexposed to news about UK compared to France, Germany, Russia etc
I think a lot of American networks sell a lot of digested news to our networks
The supply-chain of news is just super effective
And because of this we know comparably a lot about US and UK and are thus able to consume and interested in higher quantities and qualities of nes from these countries
There is also a certain element of fascination with the US in our countries, especially in the kind of people who run the media business, although shitting on the US is so popular now they would hardly admit it
Some people in Denmark seem to care about the US internal politics in a manner they would otherwise only care about their own country
Hence why people hold BLM support protests all over the world, but basically no one holds Belarus support protests for instance
Not that I don't think BLM is a legitimate cause, but it just feels completely out of place to see people shouting out slogans and yelling I CAN*T BREATHE in English at a Danish protest
People have opininos about US politics in a way they would never have about the internal politics of another country - I would say that for the average Dane, the US political system is familiar but the one in neighboring Germany, a very important country, is quite obscure in comparison
First of all, i feel danish
In my bones, but just a whisper behind that, i feel nordic
I feel a historically and especially very cultural bond with the other nordic countries
After that, i embrace the diversity of europe
Where the other nordics are my brothers and sisters, the rest of europe are my cousins
Beyond that, no
I think the European identity is real, but not in the way most people talk about it
I identify with my region, the my country, then Scandinavia, and THEN European
i just want the kalmar union part 2 electric boogaloo
>I don't think that many Europeans could honestly say that Asian countries have the same connection to them as another European country, like, I can't see anyone in Finland saying that Spain is culturally more distant than Iraq or Syria or Turkey or Morocco, even though the distance isn't far off
Drop a Scot in New Zealand and another in Moldova and ask them a week in which one encountered the most cultural similarities
I personally didn't find New York and Melbourne more "foreign" than barcelona, and i don't mean that as a negative thing, it's just that real cultural affinity don't neatly fit into political constructs like "Europe", though of course there's bound to be some overlap
I have a friend who has said the same
Language is a big part of it I think but also stuff like having seen so much of your media
id argue full danish control would be ideal, but then again i might be slightly biased
But we danes feel we are scandinavians much more than continental europe
The little mermaid in Copenhagen
You can buy souvenirs bigger than the statue
But we have a lot of other nice places to see
My parents got dissapointed about Rome
Too dirty, too many scammers etc
The Little Mermaid in Copenhagen
Despite the name literally being The LITTLE Mermaid, people still seem to be disappointed by it's small size
It's kind of a tourist trap too, since there are a lot of expensive food stands around
Malmö, Sweden
I've hosted lots of tourists on Airbnb here in Copenhagen who had to try out Malmö to check Sweden off the list
They were disappointed as there really not much to do there
The streets are empty
Lots of lots boring compared to just staying in Copenhagen
Also - The little mermaid here in CPH
It's just a tiny statue
Don't bother
Everyone expects the statue to be some ancient, huge statue carved in a mountain or something
If you're in the area, take a day trip to Girona
Absolutely beautiful medieval town in the centre
Barcelona has some cool stuff though, I like it
> more rural areas, like Kreuzberg or Friedrichshain
Hol up
> London is also barely representative of England and feels like a foreign country at times
Well, that's part of London's appeal
It's been an international centre and a melting pot for almost two centuries
If I want to go see cottages and rural stuff, I'd go to Devon or something
Atomium is cool
Great way secure a Great Prophet
I think you should definitely go there
Kastellet, Langelinje, Amalienborg, the Marble Church, the view towards Holmen and so on are all great
The trip out there is really nice
It's just that the statue is uninteresting
Go for the journey, not the destination
Hippety hoppety
This is now all, vacation property
Încă nu am vizitat castelul, dar vreau să merge inainte devine Bran doi
> Just a 19th century escapist fantasy of what a castle is
I mean that in itself is interesting to me
When I backpacked in Australia I really wanted to go to Aernem Land to see the aboriginal stuff and tracks of the Macassan sailors, but since I couldnt rent a car it just wasnt feasible
My only regret from that trip still
Sweden, those Swedes better get back to their side of the lake
Heyyy
> Denmark in general
A nice all-rounder
I feel like all of Scandinavia dislikes Sweden
I feel like all of Scandinavia dislikes Sweden
This is the best comment I’ve seen online I think
HI NEIGHBOOR
You want some of the cookies I baked today
Svenskjävlar
Well Norway was part of either Sweden or Denmark for a long time
Just shows Norwegians are the most likable
I distinctly remember that being you guys idea
Nah of course not
Sibling hate ya know
Fax
Skåne is just as weird to us as it is to you
Idk they talk funny
Have you heard yourself haha
It's not a mix between swedish and Danish
It's harder to understand than, say, someone from Stockholm
Yes
yes it is
Skånian is literally swedified Danish, and has a ton of Danish words which typical Swedish doesn't. Skånsk also has the danish r-sound, unlike standard Swedish
The reason you find it harder to understand is because you have more exposure to Stockholm Swedish, not because Skånsk is more different from Danish
All I know is that I live right across from Skåne yet I cannot understand them at all (We have a lot of swedish costumers at work during the summer)
Well, the Scandinavian languages all influence each other, and were descended from old norse as far as I'm aware
I'm pretty sure we all spoke the same language at one point, but I'm not 100% sure on it
I have never heard about that before and Danish showers/bathrooms don't have a secondary drain
i've heard of it happening
but i dont believe it's a common thing at all
i have heard of something worse
people dying in an apartment, all lonely, and then the corpse rots and it basically ruins the apartment, and the neighbours call the building attendant because of the smell
TBH this sounds more like a rumour than an actual thing
I'm sure there is a good reason that Finnish showers have two drains but i refuse to believe it is actually specifically because of people being drunk in the shower
You forgot to mention that it was in student housing
That makes it a 100 times more believable to me
imagined this was a more general thing in Finland
Thanks for the link
I couldn't help but laugh a little
Could very well have been me in my early twenties
That sounds like a bathtub  not a shower
Utah ≠ Croatia
OP was asking Croatians and surrounding nations of their experiences from the earthquake this morning
Not Americans about an earthquake days ago that was completely unrelated
His comment added nothing of discussion to the thread
My comment was a bit of a jab at that
Amsterdam was quite overcrowded the two times I've visited the city
I went there for an event both times, so it was nice to put Amsterdam on the been there done that list, but it's not a place I wanna go to, if I'm not attending something
I was supposed to go to Rotterdam this year (for Eurovision), but now I hope to go next year instead, I heard a lot of good things about Rotterdam
Please don't put us in the same box as the Swedes
Danish and Swedish
Knep: DK to f*ck, SE trick
Glas(s) DK Glass, SE ice cream
Rolig: DK calm, SE funny
Bøg/bög: DK Beech, SE gay
Dog: DK though, SE died
Bonus
Danish and Norwegian
Morgenbrød: DK bread eaten in the morning, NO male erection in the morning
Norwegian: rar (means weird, strange) and Danish: rar (means cozy, nice)
And Swedish: frukost (means breakfast) and Danish frokost (means lunch)
It can lead to funny misunderstandings
Danish and English do have some too
Words in () is the Danish translation of the English meaning
Fart : DK speed, EN flatulence (DK prut)
And: DK and, EN duck (DK og)
Patetisk/pathetic:  DK full of emotions (solemnly), EN  pityful (DK ynkelig)
Slide: DK work hard, EN glide (DK rutchebane)
Save: DK saws, EN well
Guess  (DK gem)
“Fart” in danish means speed, also we have a city called Middelfart
Another good DK vs NO one:
DK: Dåse = "Can", as in a metal can for drinks
NO: Dåse = "Pussy", no explanation needed
This difference has gotten me into an awkward situation in Norway
Do you mean Swedish
Lunch is in the Danish dictionary, but it is not used, it is frokost here too
By is more like town while landsby (country/land+town) is a village and storby (big+town) is a city
However sometimes you just use by for any of them when making conversation
Not surprisingly, in Danish "seng" used to mean the bed linnen but it changed meaning along the way
It's more surprising that dýna means mattress in Icelandic as the word is associated with dun (down)
As far as a I know, mattresses were traditionally stuffed with straw in Denmark, but perhaps wool or down was used in Iceland explaining the difference
Thanks :) I did not know that
Maybe it is because the two words sound similar
It might be the same with korv/kurv, they sound the same but means two different things (sausage/basket)
Ohh
but it can get more confusing ...
Middag can mean both lunch and dinner in Danish
In Danish there is a proverb that sounds something like this:
"Gift er noget, man tager, for ikke at blive det
Poison is something you take, not to be it (married)
Gift is both married and poison
Bolle does mean bun too in Danish
And then there is "byen" which is a specific town, but can also mean that you are going out drinking (Skal vi I byen i aften
= Wanna go out(drinking) tonight
I'm guessing korv has to do with cow sausage
Yeah
It still exists in Danish as medgift
Yeah
I misread the comment
Well - there is this sentence at the Baker: der ligger snegle og boller i vinduet
Snails are f***** in the window at the baker
I love where I live
I would move abroad (again) for family but not for work
I like it a lot, safe country, the best place to get sick or loose your job
There's a reason "love" is in Slovenia :)
I joked about moving to Norway earlier today, it has been 25 degrees all week here
Thanks
Typos are my life now
It's been pretty damn great
We've been too far north for many empires to want to conquer us, and as a result we and the other northern countries have been able to pretty much stick to ourselves
Except the fact that both of our neighbours wanted to destroy us multiple times, and both came very close to succeeding at least once
Germany in 1940, and Sweden in 1658
> I've always wondered how it's like to be able to just casually go there if you want to
You know how you can just casually go to the mountains when you want
It's like that, but wetter
Very accurate
Germany has definitely been the main threat throughout Danish history as we share a border with them
First as Saxons, then as part of the Frankish Empire, then the East-Frankish Kingdom, then the Holy Roman Empire, then mainly Prussia and finally in the 2 world wars
1500 years of "Poke the Germans, poke the Germans, oh my god they're coming
Even then, of all the cardinal directions, north is definitely the one Germany has pursued the least
Constant warring with France to the west, Poland/whoever happens to rule Poland to the east and the whole papal situation to the south
Yet Germany didn't start becoming an active threat to Denmark until after unification, which means that until the 19th century, our primary concern was always Sweden
Dude we had Norway for centuries, but those bloody Swedes took them away
But I do feel grateful when i hear stories about hurricanes, earthquakes and tsunamis, that we don't get that stuff here
Depends on the year
Gulf stream + coastal climate
Yeah, Greece is literally the world's leading nation in shipping, with more trade vessels than any other nation
And that's not proportional, it's in raw tonnage
Which is why I'm reeeeally not looking forward to the mosquitoes this summer
Already seen a few swarming about
I don't even know what "it's worth it" is supposed to mean
Anatolia has historically been the place that got rolled over, whenever the balance of power shifted within a 400 km radius
Rise of the Persian empire - Anatolia gets rolled over
Greco-Persian wars - Anatolia gets rolled over
Alexander the great
Rolled over
Rome
Rolled over
Roman-Persian wars, basically all of Byzantium vs the Turks, the 20th century conflicts
I see you're a man of culture
How fuckin dare you
After losing Skåne we still had Norway, Iceland, Slesvig-Holsten and Greenland
I would say it's not until after we lost Norway, that we became "irrelevant"
You're pretty much right about everything the only thing i will add is that we did actually win the war against Sweden to get Skåne back in the 1670s. We had it, but then Sweden got their ally France involved who told us to give it all back again
And of course we technically won the great Northern war but I agree that we were pretty clearly carried by Russia
We barely did anything and for that reason we only got Slesvig-Holsten back
Skåne stayed Swedish
Universities in Denmark are pretty equal in quality, but each specialises a bit
I would definitely say Aarhus and Copenhagen are best for life sciences, but if you want to do something life science engineering, it's worth to consider Aalborg too
Did life sciences at Aarhus myself, if you have any questions
In the last 5 years there has been a huge increase in housing, so it should be no problems getting either a dorm room or a shared apartment
All master's courses outside of profession specific ones(law, medicine, etc) are exclusively in English, and they are almost exclusively taught by the research group leaders, at least in Molecular Biology
What kind of life science are you specifically looking for
Job wise, it's usually a lot of service industry jobs
I know a lot of international students work in food delivery as it's flexible with hours, and you basically just have a bike to be able to work, and the fact that when you are an EU citizen, as long as you work 10 hours a week, you are entitled to the study stipend of approximately €800/mo which will most likely pay your rent and food
There's a strong and welcoming student environment for international students at the Student House close to campus, which hosts a lot of parties, but also runs a cafe and a bar every day of the week
A few that I've heard other people use as well:
"Lægge en dej" = "Drop a dough"
"Tømme ryggen" = "Empty the back"
"At puste grise"
To blow pigs, I don't really get why
Some years ago a Christmas calendar tv show called The Julekalender, popularised a lot of phrases one of which was said by the main character Oluf Sand
He used to say:
"Jeg går ud og puster grise op
" which translate directly into "I'm going to blow up pigs
Blow up like air in a balloon, not like a bridge with explosives
Blow up pigs (puste grise op) is the funniest I think
Another classic is "empty your back" (tømme ryggen)
"Lægge en arm" = "Drop an arm" is related and terrible
Slå en streg
"beat a stick" for having a piss
Let's not forget:
"Puste grise op" = "inflate pigs
" 90's slang
don't ask
"Sende Bruno til svømning" = "Send Bruno to his swimming lessons". Bruno is a Danish boys name, very close in pronunciation to "brun" which is Danish for the color brown
In this context, "slå" doesn't mean "beat", but something along the line of "draw". Like in "slå korsets tegn" - you don't beat the sign of the cross, you draw the sign of the cross
Don't fear my accuracy, I am a benign pisser
You seem fun
Well we can easily agree racism=bad, but to get mad and complaining over a way of saying "taking a shit" seems like a bit of a Karen move
Sry i have humour and the people in my culture can take a joke
which part or joke dont u understand
U rly fit the stereotypical 0humor german
I’ve only seen a few Ladas in my country
Generally because we don’t need it to survive harsh winters
In Denmark, we are more interested in 2008-2020 cars, and the newer ones didn’t really reach Denmark
I have seen Greeks often cross the road while they have red sign, I feel almost compelled to stop every time I see the red man
Do they use am and pm in Spain
I'm fine with the disreputable bars
Over here driver will get ticketed if the passengers aren't wearing seat belts
You buckle up, or we're not going anywhere
When I lived in the UK for an exchange they showed us that campaign at sixth form - they also showed another one with a group of girls, where baby dies
I still think about it every couple of months, made me absolutely terrified
It's illegal not to wear a seatbelt in Denmark
I guess there's a reason Denmark is one of the safest countries in the world
When people from the US mention staying out until 6 am like it's a wild and crazy thing to do, I always chuckle a little
The standard closing time for bars and clubs is 5 am, here
During the week it may be earlier, like 2 am, but Friday and Saturday night opening hours are usually 11 pm - 5 am for clubs
Bars can be anything from 11 am - 5 am, with some "after hours" places open from 1 am to like, 9 or 10 am
In Scandinavia (at least Denmark) if you invite someone over for dinner it’s expected that the host makes the food
In Denmark you havde food for your guests, unless you explicitly tell them, that they bring their own
The one that starts at around 5 minutes is the one that got to me, I honestly still think about it 10 years after having watched it at sixth form:
6 pm
I can barely see a thing when I go home at 4
> daylight
wozzat
Sorry for introducing it to you then - the dead baby is what really got me back then (and still)
You guys a brutal with those commercials, no punches pulled
Yeah here the normal time is between 18-19, but it can be extended to as early as 17 or as late as 20 depending on circumstance
I would never eat dinner after 21, though - that's crazy late
I mean many of the H.C. Andersen stories are quite grim when it comes to the originals
We still read them for kids though - it's a common baptism gift to give the 'child' the completed set of the stories
Also, I guess, the Norse Myth stories
Growing up the most popular comic was an illustrated version of the myths for children called "Valhalla" by Peter Madsen
I clearly remember it had stories about Odin trying to cheat Freja into sleeping with him, people getting killed and torn apart, all the stuff the original myths had
My international friends also look at me weirdly whenever I mention any of the folktales my parents used to tell me
Like [Nøkken] [Mosekonen] or [Nisser] The only that ever gave me nightmares though, was [Trolderik] He used to scare me a lot and he would swear during his show (like calling his grandmother "en gammel sur kælling" which kinda means "an old angry bitch"), which scared me even more
Also sometimes he would show up in malls and stuff and seeing that character as a two-meter tall person, is terrifying
Most likely every single story from Hans Christian Andersen
I forever associate Black Peter (Sorteper in Danish) with a black tomcat, because the card game had figures of cute animal couples on them and a lone tomcat as Black Peter
I think [this] is the set I played with
I feel like Putin would beat up a lot of people
He was in the KGB after all
From Denmark where “frokost” is lunch
In Sweden “frukost” is breakfast, that caused a few confusions
Also when I lived in London I had to get used to that “half nine” would mean “half past nine”, where the danish equivalent of “half nine” (halv ni) is half past eight
In Denmark most people consider a 40 minutes car ride 'far away'
In Danish we distinguish between them as well
Krydret(literally spicy) is with any kind of spice, while "stærkt"(Strong) is reserved for chili
I live in a different city than the village I grew up in, there is 17 km between my current appartment and my childhood home
You can travel from the tip of Denmark to copenhagen in about 5-6 hours
I love my country and feel very much at home, I think i would fit in just as well in norway tho
I have a friend from Boznia & Herzegovina who feels the exact way too
He says that visiting his family in Boznia & Herzegovina makes it a lot better, but he doesn't really feel at home here in Denmark
That's how I feel as well
I used to have dreams about moving, sort of "Grass is always greener" type stuff but the more I've learned about Denmark and about other places, the more I've come to realize that I really prefer living here
I can always go visit those other places with different nature, different culture, different food, different history etc
if I want a new experience
I'm sure I'd feel the same way if I was from most other countries so it's got nothing in particular to do with Denmark, it has to do with what I'm used to, what I've grown up with, the values I've grown up with and have adopted etc
I suppose it might be fun trying to live somewhere else (at least for a while) if I won some big lottery, inherited a fortune or whatever so I didn't have to worry about finding a job etc
in the new country, and could just spend my time checking out the things that country has to offer but that seems unlikely to ever happen
Oh dang, my Dear, sweet, half cousin twice removed and all such things
I don't know haha :D only been to sweden once, and my main memory from that is getting a horrible, horrible food poisoning from my first and last time having sushi, ever
Been to norway multiple times and love it
But, you are our slightly retarded brother, so i cant really say no to you
I think it's just too easy to "blame us" though
Plenty of immigrants from various places "fit in" perfectly fine and it's the ones who actually integrate
It's hardly surprising that people who don't integrate into their new country will have a harder time "feeling at home" there than others
I went to school with a Polish guy for example, and he was no different from us Danes at all, besides him having a Polish name and his parents having an accent
He played football with us Danes, he went drinking with us Danes, he invited people over for his birthday like us Danes, he hated school and homework like us Danes etc
etc
So he was included in everything he wanted to be included in
My sister dated a Dane from an Iranian background at one point, and when he talked about his parents it was very much about a "When in Rome
" mentality
They'd still celebrate some traditional Muslim holidays and stuff but they had basically become "culturally Muslim" and nothing more after arriving in Denmark, and his parents insisted that it was the only way they'd ever really fit in and "become Danish". His parents also made sure that he and his siblings were around other Danes, they didn't want to live in a "ghetto" or "bubble" etc
If it hadn't been for his Iranian name and slightly darker skin tone, you'd never have known he wasn't just another Dane
His mentality was Danish, his eating habits were Danish, his humor was Danish, he didn't care about religion in more than a cultural sense, he'd drink alcohol with us etc
and was just generally a really cool guy
On the other hand I've also met people who don't integrate at all
They actively cling onto their own culture, own norms, own views, own values etc
etc
and that obviously leads to way more problems "feeling at home" in a new country
It doesn't just go for people from Muslim countries although they're probably the majority of that group today, I've also experienced the same with East Asians for example
If they stick to the East Asian way of parenting, of behaving etc
obviously they'll always "stick out" among Danes
Danes don't have to whole "save face" mentality for example, or the "protecting the family's honor" type mentality, so Danes will happily laugh at themselves, they'll happily tease each other etc
as there's simply no concept of it "being insulting" or whatever
It's just seen as fun and nothing else, and both parties know that
You simply can't cling onto a completely foreign culture, mentality, set of values, behaviors etc
in a new country and then blame everyone around you for not accepting you as one of them
You chose not to be
Danes, Norwegians or whatever don't wanna have to walk on eggshells around their friends because one of them is completely different, doesn't share much of anything with them, is offended by their humor, their drinking etc
etc
Friends are generally those people you like to hang out with because you have a lot in common, enjoy the same things and so on, so if someone is completely different, it's no wonder that friendships don't really work
That's not a Nordic thing though, that's a human thing
Just reverse the roles and imagine you sticking to Norwegian culture, traditions, values, humor, drinking etc
in Iran for example
Or hell, even just here in Europe
If you don't integrate you'll always be "The Norwegian" to the people around you in another country
It's one thing to cling onto your culture, social norms etc
if you're a refugees who's going back to your own country as soon as possible, but if you plan on staying in the new country you're going to have to integrate and "become Norwegian" (or wherever you are) if you want yourself and your kids to have the best chance in life, to feel at home, to have local friends etc
Everyone does it, abselutely everywhere from the most remote village to copenhagen
Most people drink to get drunk or just for fun even if they dont get drunk
In Denmark we start way earlier .. not sure I should be proud of that
Snaps is a ceremonial thing at best
You drink at certain occations, but you wouldn't see people go into a bar and order two beers and two snaps on a normal saturday evening
Maybe not on a saturday evening
But it's not uncommon among the older generation to have øl and a snaps (øl med sidevogn) for lunch or after work at a pub
In Scandinavia it is not made from fruit, usually grain
Also usually infused with herbs and other stuff
It's also common for people to flavour their own snaps using herbs, nuts, berries
Systembolaget is 20+ no
Recently went there and had no problem buying while I was only 20
"Landevejs riddere" (Knights of the country roads)  A a type of vagabond lifestyle
It was a complete with its own culture and traditions
Where people lived their entire lives on the open road, often bringing all their worldly possessions in a  baby carriage, or decorated cart
Covered in medals, having a raccons/fox tail in their hats and accompanied by a faithful dog
Doing odd jobs, sharpening knives for people as "skærsliber" (translates to  cutting-grinder) or earning some money by singing and playing the harmonica as a "gårdsanger" (Tanslates to something like backyard singer)
[Example]
They have been around for a long time, but i think they are similar to your Luffare's.
I've never seen anything like it here
I know there was a case some years ago where a bus company (public transportation) refused a pentecoastal church add space on their busses
The second billboard references the Bible as evidence lol
Its like saying mermaids are real because the fairytale The Little Mermaid is about mermaids
Not in Denmark, that's for sure
Billboards are not allowed most places and religious signs of any kind would be very weird any other place than at church
Never seen it in Denmark nor anywhere else I've been in Europe
All those religious groups that were hunted around Europe for their extremism went to America to avoid it
It is absolutely no wonder course the US became weirdly religious
Reminds me of that giant statue of Jesus with a crown Poland build in the middle of nowhere
Also in Denmark billboards along roads are illegal for the most part, and most conservative religious people (except Jehovah's witnesses) aren't really a part of the public scene
I think they realise that blatant advertisement like that would backfire and create negative feelings towards them
Nobody wants to hear or see these bible thumping maniacs, and luckily we only have few I Denmark
If mermaids aren't real, then why is there a statue of one right in the capital, huh
Taking the statue all the way to Shanghai for an expo was a diplomatic mission on behalf of Aquatic Danes
The official tourist board wouldn't *lie* to visitors and taunt them by having a mermaid as their logo, come on
Shit, you got me
Scandinavian languages (Danish, Norwegian, Swedish), but not all Nordic languages like Icelandic and Finnish or local languages like Faroese and Greenlandic
Norwegian uses a lot of the same words as Danish, and I’m often told by people from other countries that they cannot tell them apart from each other
Swedish is also close to Danish but to a lesser extent, so it can be a little more difficult to read
(I should add that even some Danish people can’t tell written Danish and Norwegian apart, instead thinking it is just Danish with some grammar mistakes or typos)
Norweigian text was literally the same as Danish until some time in the last century
And it’s still very easy to read (Bokmål)
They just changed the spelling so it looks like it was written by a child who can’t spell right, nevertheless it actually makes sense to write it like that
Examples: Nation = Nasjon
Centrum = Sentrum
Service = Sørvis
Nynorsk is more difficult
Swedish is different but still easy enough to understand
Faerose and Icelandic is more special, if I were to read a news article I could probably understand the basic topic
If I had to go on I’d say it’s possible to make out some of the words reading Dutch or German, even if you don’t know the languages
For me I find it easy to understand Norwegian Bokmål and to a lesser extent Swedish and Dutch
Swedish
And Norwegian written is just Danish so yeah
Norwwegian, and most of the time Swedish
Sometimes we get surprised by the amount of Dutch we understand when reading
Swedish and Norwegian
It's not that a lot of people can't understand those languages spoken, but it's much easier written
German is a close second for many
From Denmark: Swedish and Norwegian is pretty easy to read
Norwegian is also somewhat understandable verbally, but Swedish (and Sweden) straight up sucks
Norwegian
It's often said in Denmark, that Norwegian is Danish, but you type how the word actually sounds
Depending on the dialect, no
If it's "Standard Norwegian" or Scanian, it's not too hard for me to understand it, since those are the dialects (probably) most similar to Danish, but the farther away it is from those, the harder it gets
Though, now we're at it, I'd like to address that, no, Danes don't inherently understand Norwegian and Swedish better than Norwegians and Swedes understand Danish, as some people seem to think
My theory is that watching Swedish TV used to be much more common here in the past because of the limited amount of channels (My parents told me that all the kids used to watch Swedish TV all the time, at least), so they got more acquainted with the language (which in pronunciation is closer to Norwegian than it is to Danish, helping with that as well) thereby starting the myth that we do
Danish has two systems for comma placement, one of which make no sense, but both are used leading to some confusion from time to time
No, bokmål is way closer to danish
If I read bokmål out loud i can pronounce almost everything in danish, where as nynorsk could be russian for that matter
Young people are very fast to switch to English instead of trying to understand
We're as conservative and change averse with grammar and spelling as we've been idgaf with pronunciation, it's an odd combo
Our comma was botched completely when the slight modernization that was attempted caused a backlash so now we have two official commas: one archaic and comma heavy, and one slightly less so
I gave up in high school and now just put commas where the lack of one impedes reading or comprehension
When I went to Göteborg I tried to speak danish and understand their Swedish but I just couldn’t understand them so I switched to English
The one guy I talked to seemed to understand me, I just couldn’t understand him for some reason, maybe they have a weird dialect in Göteborg
Denmark's true traditional national fast food has got to be the classic [Danish Hot Dog] Especially good when purchased from a [pølsevogn ("Sausage wagon")] and enjoyed on a cold winter day with a warm [Cocio Chocolate Milk
French hot dogs
Anything with Remoulade tbh
99% korrekt
Cocio skal være koldt
With vinegar, mind
Not a grilled hot dog with everything
I guess it could go either way
It could, probably
But the french ones are more exclusive to Denmark
Pretty much every single household has a flag in Denmark
In fact, it's pretty odd to not have one
We have official flag days, where most people hang their flags
We hang out our flag when someone in the household has their birthday
We set the flag halfway on the flagpole when somebody dies, and hoist it to the top after they've been buried
It's considered bad luck to have your flag out after sunset, because at that point, you're celebrating the devil
For more casual use, most Danes have a "vimpel", which is the Danish flag, but shaped like a very long triangle
You can hang these all year round, even at night
Also, on Danish birthdays in general, there are Danish flags everywhere
On the yard, in the house on the cake, et cetera
We really do like our flag
> displaying it for no reason is kinda strange
This is the main difference between Sweden and Denmark
We display the flag at all times, for any and for no reason
Birthday party
Flag
Greeting people at the airport
Flag
Cake
Flag
The sun is shining
BIG flag
Doormat to summerhouse

Open session in Parliament

Random holiday
All busses are flying flags
That's not a joke, all busses in all of Denmark will have the Dannebrog flying high on any random holiday
I second this
Kids coming home from camp
The parents will be waving flags (only for young kids though
Older kids would be embarressed) . Picking up relatives at the airport
Don't forget your flag
Confetti on New Years
Colored paper and
yes, you guessed it
We do love our flag
HOWEVER; putting up a flag as a wall decoration in (for example) your living room is seen as very bad taste
You use the flag to celebrate or mourn, not as common room/house decoration
In short: The flag is used "at events". Any other use is just
cheap
> People who say American flag-use is excessive obviously have never been to Denmark
I have yet to see Danish flags as part of the normal, everyday interior decoration in places such as classrooms (There always at least three or four), shops/supermarkets, etc in Denmark
I also disagree a bit with comparing American and Danish flag use
Yeah we use it all the time for celebrations and decorations, but on the other hand it became a bit controversial when the speaker of the parliament tried to hang the Danish flag in the hall of parliament
We really don't like our flag being used as a political symbol not even as a patriotic one
Same, everyone in my town has one
I cannot recognise this
On all holidays
That is simply not true, which memorial days
Liberation Day maybe
Jubilees, maybe, everything to do with birthdays, definitely
Some put the flag on christmass trees, not everybody
Most of the peaople I know do not own af danish flag
They may buy som paper-ones at birthdays, yes
All in all, I do not agree with you
I’m a globalist and I have a Danish flag at my window
Why not have a flag, they’re beautiful and I can show of my patriotism with it
Actually
I have a massive danish flag hanging on my wall in my room
The speaker from the Far-Right Danish People's Party, Pia Kjærsgaard, Wanted to display was Enormous, and it did not fit in
[Officielle flagdage]
I stand by my comment
But I'm not one to tell you what to decorate your home with
Wall scrolls, Katanas, Waifu pillows
You do you
It is not seen as bad taste
I don't know where he got that idea from
In my experience, I only see flags in supermarkets during big sales, which are rarer
I mainly use Netto and Fakta though, not sure where there's constant sales going on
Yea, schools tend to have a flag pole or five outside dotted around, depending on their size
I have yet to see it follow me much inside though, except for themed days or graduations
I’ve seen them a lot in the suburbs, e.g Stavtrup (Aarhus)
Very common there
I'm not sure that makes it a whole lot better
The American private use of the flag feels very political/patriotic and not simply because it's *hyggeligt*.
But that does not mean that everybody flags on the official days
Most Danes do not have a flagpole or do the slightest form of waving a flag - Big or small - on those days
Why if it’s ok I ask
Waifu pillows
Man of culture I see
It helps that our flag is Christmas-coloured
If you don't have a flag pole then no, you don't see people standing by the road waving flags unless the Queen drives by
You can't help but to notice the flags on officiel buildings on flag days
You say "most danes" but it seems to be that you're the odd one out in this discussion
I must ask what part of Denmark are you from
The patriotic use of the flag in the US feels to me as a political statement as oppose to use it simply because it's nice (hyggeligt) as in the Danish way
Grew up in Saeby, live in Aarhus
You can't really be an internationalist without the nations
Without nations you would be more like a globalist or regionalist
Thanks for explaining
>Would immigrants fly the flags of their birth country
It's not necessarily legal to fly foreign flags
And that's even his country's fault
>I believe it reproduces similar ideological lines as the American use
´What non-hyggeligt use of Dannebrog similar to the US do you see
Yup and that is exactly where I and Drahy disagree
>Unity across national boundaries
Yes, you can't have unity or cooperation between nations without the actual nations
You can fly flags from the Nordics without permission
But with other foreign state flags you would need to fly Dannebrog next to the foreign flag to obtain a permission
An exception can be made if you only have one flag pole
Yes, but we are talking about the use of it
In private use, Dannebog is used as a symbol of private celebration
That is different from the patriotic use of Stars and Stripes in the US
If you take away the symbolism of nations you don't really have nations left
They would be more like administrative regions and thus no more inter*nationalism*.
Foreign state flags on flag poles in front of houses
If you succeed in removing the nations and are left with regions, would internationalism then change meaning to the restoration of nations in your opinion
I mean in a world without nations but only regions united globally, you could hardly claim to be international anymore
[This picture] went the rounds in Denmark back in 2015
It was at the height of the migrant crisis and groups of migrants were quite literally wandering on the highways
I can't remember all the details, but a cop decided to play with a little girl during one police holdup
If it is more historical I guess it would be one of the many, many pictures of [King Christian 10
riding his horse] through Copenhagen during the nazi occupation
The first one i thought of was [Christian 10
crossing the border] into Sønderjylland after the referendum to reunite with Denmark
We lost the war in 1864 to the Prussians and they took all of Holstein and Schleswig including Sønderjylland/Northern Schleswig despite it being majority Danish
After WWI the entente offered Denmark to revise the Danish-German border, however instead of just taking all of it back, the Danish government decided to let the people vote for which country they would belong to leading to the modern day border
[Here's the border from 1864-1920, if you're interested
That the country is a bit too small in size and population
It seems like you need minimum a 8-10 million population to make yourself heard in Europe so to speak
It's actually kinda annoying
It perhaps sounds like a meme, but the corona crises has also shown the downside of the old Danish parts currently being Swedish with the Øresund being closed
It's basically just a wide "river" in Copenhagen today, but now people working in the city are turned away, when they try to go back to their homes in Malmø, because the border control doesn't accept their residential documentation
Even transit through Scania to the island of Bornholm was closed, meaning that Danish citizens couldn't travel from one point in Denmark to another, unless they took a plane or ferry, which were overbooked
Making new friends here is very hard - just ask any expat working here
Many people stick with the same small group of friends they grew up with, or met while studying
If you don't have such a group, you are fucked
How hard it is to get mental health support if you aren't insanely lucky or have a lot of money
My friend has PTSD and anxiety among a handful of other disorders but can't get a therapist
It's also incredibly expensive to get diagnosed for mental disorders like ADHD if you don't wanna wait five years
How little help you can get if you have an unspecified illness
Been trying to figure out what’s wrong with me for almost 5 years now, and no doctor or specialist can figure out what it is, and it’s keeping me from completing my education/getting a full time job, but I also can’t get government support as I would have to “work” a full time job in order to get any kind of money - which I unfortunately can’t do atm
I was told that getting medically exempt is only really viable if I have a diagnosed illness, but as no one has been able to figure out what’s wrong I’m stuck in a limbo
This isn’t really unique to me either apparently, and it really sucks
This
It is only thing I always find painful when travelling in Germany
The lack of cashless payment is astounding
I remember having to go to an atm to exchange, then having to pay for something in cafe in order to get small 0,50c exchange to go to the toilet
How's the Swiss work mentality
Any difference between boomers and zoomers
I was so lucky to get an amazing therapist "quickly", which was a like six months wait
Can agree on that
5 years waiting time is
ridculous to say the least
I waited 5 years and I am royally fucked in comparison to when we first tried to see if I could get help
Out of curiosity could you explain the behavior
Would be nice with a little more context
Which word for them can I use safely around them or others, and which one will get people pissed at me
Outside of NI troubles, bad American tech companies and tax heaven, Ireland is rarely mentioned here, and it's not really portrayed as a country, you need to take seriously in politics, unlike countries like Holland and Austria
You could of course argue the same about Belgium, but they have a good football team
In what way is Denmark portrayed in Ireland as anything other than a small country
Is Sweden portrayed differently
My parents got a private therapist but I honestly think my friend deserves one way more than me
It is but there's often a long waiting list and is not prioitized
I think it’s just a very unfortunate side effect of anything that is implemented on a large scale - some people fall through the cracks
I really hope things work out for you, and that issues like these will be ironed out in the (not too distant) future
Well our healthcare is generally fine - but only if they’re able to figure out what’s actually wrong, then the care and economic support you get is decent (cancer for instance)
The trouble is when they don’t know what’s wrong, cause then I guess it’s difficult to make a treatment plan and therefore makes it more difficult to get work exemptions when applying for benefits
Not sure if that’s how it works for everyone, but that’s my experience at least
Not a priority and an extremely long waiting list causes it from what I know
Bad tech companies as in how they exploit Europeans personal information and don't pay tax of their profits
>The whole world celebrates our national holiday
I've only heard that they colour a river green in a city in the US
>that can’t be said for any other European nation
Well, Denmark doesn't even have a national day, lol
>Irish politicians have held numerous top jobs in the EU
When was that
At least Denmark currently has Margrethe Vestager (Executive Vice-President), but despite her popularity in the EU system, she was not chosen as president of the commission, which again was taking as a sign, how Denmark was too small put any weight behind her
Yes, it strikes me a lot at random times
Also reminds me how fortunate we are for living right in this tiny pocket of time
and also how fragile peace is
When I was 6 I had memories of Barney, when my aunt uncle were 6 they had memories of German soldiers patrolling the streets
Their beaches were filled  bunkers, cannons, mines and machine guns, my beach was with sand castles and ice cream
Most of us have heard stories from the war from our loved ones (mostly granparents)
It makes you appreciate peace and hopefully be less ready to participate in wars outside of Europe too
Not really
We were neutral during WW1, and barely fought in WW2
I've also heard western Denmark being referred to as "the whipped cream front" because it was so peaceful
Out west we have some German infrastructure, mostly bunkers, a couple if cannons, and some special roads made if large blocks
So we don't really have any memories of the fighting, just from the, after Nazi standards, very peaceful occupation
A barrel of land is 5516 m² and is the amount of land you can sow with a barrel of grain
It is still used by farmers
In danish one barrel of land
It was traditionally the amount of farmland that you could sow with 1 barrel of seeds
It is still used to describe the size of farms, but I think it has changed to something more exact
There are [many] , but they were mostly used before the metric system
Like a dozen (which is 12 pieces) , we also have a *snes* which is 20
The area of old farms are often measured in *tønder* (barrels)
It’s traditionally the area which one barrel of seeds would cover
It’s approximately 0,55 hectares
Also *alen* (ell) I’ve heard before but it’s not used anymore
It’s the length of a forearm and hand
0,63 m.
Those are the only ones I’ve heard in use
Maybe because a Danish mile was ~7
5km and not as easily adapted to metric as your ~10
5km mile
Not an official measurement, but realtors often use "stenkast" (a stone throw) when they want to imply that a house is close to something positive like the beach or something like that
But when actually measuring the lengths of the realtors "stone throws", the average length have increased from 153 meters in 2010 to 239 meters in 2012
The longest "stone throw" was 943 meters according to the journalist who did the check on the realtors adds
What are you talking about
Denmark is [at least 2000km] from one end to the other
Not really, but a trebuchet is mandatory equipment when appraising a house
Grenen in Denmark
You can see two seas meet, with the naked eye
A lot of churches out there are absolutely stunning, when I come to a new village I almost always look inside the church
In Denmark I live the church in Marstal, since it is a fishing village, they have many beautiful homemade small ships hanging in the church, it is wonderful :)
dude wtf
Then why on Earth did he want to include it on a list called “the 7 WONDERS of Europe”?!
The Danish language
I totally bought into the “Romance languages are pretty, Germanic languages are ugly” stereotype
Plus Danish is constantly mocked by other Scandinavians
Now I really appreciate all languages for what they each individually have to offer
Rugbrød (proper dark rye bread) Used to hate being forced to eat it as a kid, now I long for it when I travel outside of the Nordics
It just fills you up in a way other food doesn't.
Same
My parents always wanted us to bike everywhere when I was growing up, but I've really come to enjoy it
And definitely also what it means for our infrastructure
Pret a Manger, definitely
As far as I know, we only have one located in CPH Airport
None, I prefer actual restaurants or cafes with real food
MAX Avocado Burger is the best fastfood I've ever had
We have them in Denmark, but they're insanly expensive
We just got KFC, suck it Norway
I didn't imagine anyone would mention Nadias
I would send you one sandwich if I could
avocado
and not really good anyway
I went there once for the novelty, and then again because the kids wanted to try it too
We're not coming back anytime soon
(TBF we eat fast food *maybe* twice per year, so it's not really a "I'll take my business elsewhere" but more of a "I kinda expected something more")
No no no no
It means the chickens were vegan
Never heard that here, most of the people I know use Hotmail
No, we use "e-mail" in casual conversation
I think it also has to do with the fact, that g-mail refers to one company, while e-mail is a general term
We just call it mail where I’m from
Which confuses a lot of Americans when I live in USA for a while
Danish word for traditional mail, like the physical form, is post
So people still call it email, but most people just say mail
However, most people assume you use Gmail
I made my hotmail to play a browser game
Still use it as my main mail
I just used three random letters and the shortest domain
So my email is something like abc@live
So fast to type
Sweden, Norway, Germany, England/Great Britain, then probably Iceland
Denmark:
- Sweden
- Norway
- Germany
- Greenland
- England
Edit: if you don't count Greenland then probably Iceland
*Laughs in kalmar union* just about all of the nordic countries except finland as they have all been part of denmark at some point
I would put Greenland before either England or Iceland
I just finished my master's in history, and there is a lot of focus on Greenland through the Danish history modules
Denmark is missing
Technically Greenland can't be on the list, since it is an autonomous region, not an independent country
Greenland and the Faroese aren't separate countries
It's like a Brit chosing Wales
>Various chunks of Germany (and German Poland) were Swedish for centuries
Various chunks of Germany were Danish for a millennia
Fair enough, if those are the criteria we set, then I agree
I hardly covered it in the modules on Danish history, we only had about Danelaw with Denmark for less than one hour during the bachelors and not at all during the masters  and in all of my history books about Danish history, its barely a footnote
Greenland, however, was basically covered repeatedly throughout all the modules - we have more shared history with Greenland, and I would say our time as a colonist/occupying nation all the way from 1242 / 1814 to 1979 / 2009 is pretty damn relevant in danish history
And that's not even counting the danification process, the Greenland treaty during WW2, Thule Air Base or all the shared history and culture through rigsfællesskabet
I mean several Brits on this thread did do that within the Kingdom, which is why I assumed it fell under the accepted criteria
But, if you want to make a list that doesn't count countries within the kingdom, then I agree
>This is a very dark time in our history that we feel Danes know very little about
It actually feels like it's other way round
The monopoly trade on Iceland was not particular lucrative as the point of it was to keep prices low and under market value, so the very poor population on Iceland still could afford it, even though things like grain became very expensive on the free market
The monopoly trade got a bad reputation, because the merchants appointed to ship grain to Iceland would sometimes send the worst grain, which couldn't be sold normally, as they only got a fixed and low price for it on Iceland
I suppose, but even then, England had a history with Wales before the latter was conquered
Denmark, however, has no history with Greenland prior to owning it
The Icelanders settled it, and the Danish kings claimed it before we ever went there
We're on to you
It was mostly France, that prevented us from getting Scania back, though
After France, we would first have to take care of England, Prussia/Germany, Russia before it's your time
Well that's a bit murky, since they are landlocked and weren't really countries for most of that shared history
There was certainly a clear distinction between the several tribes in Wales and several tribes in England all the way from Roman time, but at that point there wasn't really a "Wales" or an "England", so it isn't shared history between two different countries but that shared history between several tribes within the same landarea
One could argue that they share history as seperate countries in the early middleages, but even then its shared history between the English, and then Welsh and Viking tribes
Wales didn't become a country until 1056, and by 1282 they were under English rule
Meaning there's really just shared history between the countries of Wales and England for less than 240 years, which is basically a blink of an eye in terms of history that far back
That being said, all of this boils down to semantics
Like I said, I agree that if we are talking autonomous country only, then Greenland shouldn't be on the list
>This revisionist view of history is simply ridiculous
You are continuing the rather infamous founding myth of the Icelandic republic by Icelandic nationalists (ref
Guðmundur Hálfdanarson)
They simply needed an exterior "enemy" to create a nation
There's no documentation for the people on Iceland being heavily taxed, and the tithe to the Church was not transferred from Iceland to Copenhagen
Iceland was hit by one disaster after the other in those times, and the population on Iceland was decimated and very poor
There was simply nothing of value on Iceland, and they could barely support living there
At the same time the market price of things like grain skyrocketed, so without appointing merchants to ship grain there, they would have no reason to do so
So like it or not, the trade monopoly was a necessity, or at least viewed as such at the time, to ensure people could continue their existence on Iceland
But the trade monopoly also helped to hold the Danish realm better together and to keep the English and Dutch out of Danish waters around Iceland
In the later periods of trade monopolies, when the existence of people living in remote places like Iceland was no longer threatened, it also became clear that a more free economy was a better way to develop the societies and enable growth
No, France was a Swedish ally, but still decided the peace treaties at the time, and Denmark was every time not allowed to keep Scania or at least the places under Danish control
At least you Dutch guys didn't want the Swedish to take both sides of Øresund either
Without any warning, in defiance of international treaty, the Swedish king ordered his troops to attack Denmark-Norway a second time
There followed an attack on the capital Copenhagen, whose residents successfully defended themselves with help from the Dutch,  who honored their 1649 treaty to defend Denmark against unprovoked  invasion by sending an expeditionary fleet and army, defeating the Swedish fleet in the [Battle of the Sound] and relieving the capital
Denmark held Gotland, Helsingborg and Landskrona as well as most of Swedish Pomerania together with the Brandenburgers after the Scanian War
But the French king refused Denmark to keep anything and wanted the Treaty of Roskilde restored
When Denmark and the Brandenburgers opposed it, he moved his army all the way up to Oldenborg and forced Denmark and the Brandenburges to accept his terms
Again after the Great Nordic War, France and Great Britain refused to let Denmark control Øresund again
And csgo and overwatch and all fucking mobile/browser games that use gambling mechanics
Bold of you to assume there's even going to be any sort of human populace in 100 years ;)
Autonomic cars might make that a reality
Instead of being stuck in inner city trafic, you can just work while your car drives you from a rural place to the city
> No flying cars
The movies were wrong
I hope for this, as the only paths toward international influence
baltic, benelux and nordic powerbloc unions within the EU
The nordic countries have a high standard on working conditions, unionisation etc
The EU is trying to drag us down to the lower standard of eg
Romania as we speak
the pro-EU nordic socialist are here too
We can easily be organised and stand in unity without being a federal entity
Well the EU-wide minimum wage is the most recent thing they are trying to get through
It would totally decimate our labour market and high wages
Free movement of labour has also led to social dumping because people come here to work without unionising and working at places that don't have collective agreements, further destroying our scandinavian model
Languages need a state to survive
It's simple as that
but I am a federalist, just a social-democratic one
Well the Scandinavian model could work everywhere else, you just have to get people unionising
No reason you couldn't do that in Romania for example, but just know that it is a long and hard struggle against the people that profit off of having low wages and benefits
It's a class struggle really
We don't have a minimum wage at all in Scandinavia because we set the wages by sector according to the agreements that happen between the workers unions and the business unions
If the EU mandate a minimum wage, even a relatively high one, the wages will stagnate and the incentive to join a workers union become smaller while the business unions can always point to the minimum wage whenever there is a negotiation (every 2 years)
Every country that has put in a minimum wage has working poor
Furthermore the EU almost always either take the side of the business interests or the southern or eastern EU countries that have a lower standard than us
No, on the contrary there were EU regulations introduced in the 00's that make mandatory unionisation illegal
It used to be mandatory when you entered certain sectors that you had to join the corresponding union, but not anymore
But because the unions are almost universally seen as a positive we still retain 70% unionisation of the workforce
Our point of view is that it is the "low standard" countries that should start experimenting and push for more fair and democratic work and wage regulations, as you are the ones that are unhappy about the status quo
I think they should implement the minimum wage in the countries like yours where it is actually needed
Pushing it on us will only destroy our opinion of the EU
We usually use templates of old children programmes
Quite funny
For example, Kaj & Andrea
There's a few
This is probably the most used one: ["Egon Olsen template"]
A popular "reference meme" would be this [Træls i gennem en længere periode] It translates roughly as "Annoying for a long time".. The guy with the beanie is being interviewed about a killing another person and in the interview he shows very little remorse and said the reason for killing the other guy was because "He had been annoying for a long time period". This video already became quite known when it came out, but it really took off in around 2015-2016 when the daughter of the guy who was killed goes on TV to tell that she finds the video annoying but that just ended up boosting the popularity of the video even more
Otherwise many Danish memes are about Sweden and use different maps of Sweden or the Swedish flag as a template
Both r/Denmark and r/sweden have off-spring subreddit where most posts are about mocking each other
r/Dankmark for Danish memes mocking Sweden and r/unket for Swedish memes mocking Denmark
Wasnt Dolan also finnish
Also, or at least from what I've seen on facebook from Swedes, you guys use Alfons Åberg a lot for memes
Det er fredag mine gutter
Also koldskål (a type of yoghurt) is for some reason a meme
There was a very popular kids show on Danish national television called [Kaj og Andrea] Kaj is a stuffed toy frog and has become the base of a lot of different Danish memes
Lol, that's Kaj, from the much loved children's tv show Kaj og Andrea
It started way back in the 70s or 80s. Kaj has just become a meme for some reason
Just curious, why are you interested in the denmark subreddit
Calling it yoghurt is a sin
It's based on buttermilk and contains egg
(Edit: spelling)
Think that's the same here with "hurtig briller"
Hurtigbriller is peak nordic unity
I would say the best friend Denmark has in terms of shared culture, language and citizens liking each other, would be Norway
The norweigians might not see ud as THE closest but we are close
Sweden
But not in a "we're super close siblings". More like "we're the siblings who always fight".
Iceland is sorta the little brother that drifted away but when you finally meet it’s like you’re best friends
It can be summed up in:
From a danish wiew, Sweden bad, Norway fine
From a Swedish wiew, Denmark bad, Norway nice
I don’t really know how it is from a norweigian wiew
The further south you get, the more fun people have
The further north you get, the more you binge drink
Kinda weird
We Danes sure binge drink as well, but it seems more common here to drink a glass of wine to dinner on a common Tuesday than it does in the rest of Scandinavia
Kinda like in Southern Europe
Or maybe it’s just because a bottle of wine in Norway costs three times what it does in DK :)
Vi er alle her
Sidder og sveder lidt over svagt ihukomne bøjninger og tilfældige gloser fra ferier sydpå. Sætter lidt for meget tillid til engelsk som bro mellem germanske og romanske sprog
I think I'll start using that in Danish (Jeg forstår kun banegård) when I don't understand anything
So, as u/bhjoellund says, it is just the equivalent of "nur".
That said, your question did make me wonder where the word *kun* comes from
Is it related to *kein*? No, it's not
In fact, it comes from a contraction, which is kind of weird
*kun* is apparently the weathered-down result of the phrase "ikke uden" (or "ække uten" as it would have properly been in Old Danish)
That literally means "not without", as in the sense of "nothing beyond (that)", e.g. *only*.
the two words "ikke" and "uden" are themselves rather unlike anything in German, but the word *uden* meaning "beyond" or "outside" is related to German *ausser*.
"kun" means "only" in Danish :)
Thanks for the thorough explanation
I had no idea that *kun* was a contraction
More than I can list
Some examples
For polterabend it's tradition for the man to be dressed in a dress and sell kisses in a public place
For the wedding there's thing's like cutting the groom's socks, the groom taking the bride's stocking of only using his theeth, the last kiss when either the groom or bride leaves the room everyone rushes up to get a last kiss, there's the banging on the tables under and over which means the bride and groom have to get on or under the table and kiss and then the guests stand up cheer, drink and sing, which is something that happens randomly during the whole day/night
In denmark if the groom goes to the toilet the men get to Kiss the bride and vice versa
Also the wedding cake
It has 3 layers each containing an item
A penny, a thimble and a key i think
The symbolize wealth, and I can’t remember what the thimble and key symbolize
Also when they leave the church together we throw Rice at them
If i remember correctly its on the mouth
I would just reinstate our old flag of a black raven on a white background
Only need to change our proportions really
Our current one is a little too complicated when a more ideal one should be 5:7 or 8:11
Have you considered making it red and white instead
I think it would look good
Maybe a nice
Red and white
>Denmark: I wouldn't change a thing
I'd standardize the Nordic flags so they have the [same ratios and same colour shades]
I would use the darker shade of red from the naval flag in the normal flag
Yes
That one
Red and white are the true scandinavian colors
Actually agree with a swede for once, not too fond of the religiøs middle eastern origin
Even though the reason the nordic flags are the way they are thanks to Valdemar Sejr king of Denmark rought back a battle es standard flag from estonia which fell from the 'heavens' after the battle later being dubbed Dannebrog
Fine, as long as the others adopt our propotions and color
Yeah it was used by viking chieftains way before Dannebrog "fell from the skies" at the battle at Lyndanisse in 1219
Quadratisch
Praktisch
Gut
I love te irony of how a German is pointing out that we got greedy for wanting a small piece of land
And people say you guys don't have a sense of humour
Yeah, or maybe the HRE copied it from us
Apparently both flags started showing up somewhere in the 1200's so getting a precise date on either is going to be tricky unless you have a time machine handy
Just red and white, simple and beautiful
> Before 1982 it was also against the law to raise the flag on "wrong" times and forget to take it down
That still somewhat counts in Denmark, though not as an actual law but more of a strictly-followed etiquette
We don't own Greenland, they're an equal member of rigsfællesskabet along with the Faroe Islands
Well you guys wanted the Soviet Union and the rest of Europe
So if wanting Slesvig-Holstein means we danes got small penises, then you guys must be a bunch of pussies, going by your own logic
Are you saying /u/Flashgit76 did, or you hit mine
Hahaha duly noted
Well right now we're doing what you're doing and letting a woman run the show, so I think we're both in the clear
For now anyway
I see
I think it depends on the family
My brothers and I pay rent but I don’t think any of my friends do
It happens, but the people who do are the outliers
I've heard about it happening maybe once or twice in my entire life - and not about anybody I personally knew
Then again, here it's uncommon to live at home after 20 years old (this is also around the time where your student support starts being affected by your parents' income)
I'd imagine if more people stayed longer, then it would happen more often
Do you mean under 18
If not, i'm 18 and i had to pay my mom rent ever since i turned 18, not very much though
I know other people who do, and some who don't, I don't think it's that common
From Denmark, It happens I payed 150 euro in my gap year while working
I also paid rent when before I moved out
(I still do, but not to my parents)
I have no idea how common it is though
Nah, it's not like they have to move out at 18
It's more about them moving out when it makes sense
If they're going off to university 50 km away for example, they'll likely want to move out instead of having to do that trip twice a day
Now obviously it depends on the family, on their wealth and things like that, but in general it's really just about what the kid is doing at the time and the kid's own desire to move out
It's usually not about the kid being "kicked out" but simply that the kid has likely been thinking about it, dreaming about the "freedom" of it etc
for a year or more already, and then when they get the opportunity they'll likely want to move out if at all possible
If you're living at home and working a full time job, you may be expected to at least pay some symbolic amount every month so you'll learn how things "in the real world" actually function
But if you're just getting by while studying they'll likely not ask you to pay
Unless they're like *really* poor (by Danish standards) perhaps
There is an expectation to be independent I'd say, you're not longer a child after all
Of course you can ask for help with something if you don't know how it works but you're expected to deal with more and more stuff on your own
Pay your own bills, do your own laundry etc
The parents are trying to teach you what you need to know when you do eventually move out
Once you're in your 20s you can start talking about an expectation to move out
Probably not because the parents want to "get rid of you" but because that's what people that age do in our countries
Now obviously there's also exceptions here as parents aren't complete idiots
If they live like next door to the university the kid goes to and he/she only has one year left, it'd be a bit silly to ask them to move out at that time
Then they'll likely wait until the kid is done at uni and then he/she can move out
Iceland: Keiko (free Willy)
Denmark: Siku (polar bear) or maybe Brutalis (rhino, died in 2000)
In Denmark, the Swan is considered our national animal/pet
Everybody always says Danish is the most beautiful language they've ever heard
We sound like we have a potato in our mouths is the most common one i've heard
I can’t count how many times I’ve heard “it sounds like you have a throat disorder” and “It sounds like you have a potato stuck in your throat”
Generally I’d say we’re being bullied by our neighbors to the north/east
As a Dane, I've always thought Dutch sounded like a weird mix of Danish, German, and English, which I personally really like the sound of
Polish to me is the snake whisperer language
I completely second this
I don't mind the Scandinavian banter, but that is 60% if the jabs we get, the other 30% being kamelåså (which doesn't even look Danish), and the remaining 10% being other things
You literally cannot talk to someone from another Scandinavian country without them doing the potato or kamelåså joke at least once
It’s getting irritating
I guess they don’t think about how often we must hear it
We get it, you think it’s ugly and weird
Could you come up with another joke now
> haven't really listened to any real German speakers talking
Oh they've definitely listened to one German speaker talking
It could also be from Kristianstad maybe
I met a guy from there with a heavy accent, it sounded more Danish than Norwegian
English isnt from germanic
Its from latin
Swedes tend to assume that we understand them more than they do us, which simply is not true
Sweden used to have more TV channels than we did back in the day, and I know a lot of people who grew up in those times watched those channels, so I'm assuming they simply understand Swedish better because they have had way more exposure to it
These days, hardly anyone watches the Swedish channels, so it makes sense that younger Danes start understanding Swedish less
Personally, unless you're from Scania, I'll have a hard time understanding Swedish
Fun
My experience with Swedish is the exact opposite
You understand me but I need subtitles for you
Kamelåså not looking Danish irritates me as well
I also saw this [sketch] apparently the entire joke of it is that it sounds like Danish
I thought they were trying to speak Norwegian or something
I am probably unreasonably salty about this, but when your language gets called ugly over and over again and you’re interested in languages, it gets to you
It makes me feel like I’m cursed with an ugly language somehow
At least “Swedes are gay” is an actual joke, obviously nobody thinks Sweden is more homosexual than other places
But a lot of people really does seem to hate Danish
Which is fair enough I guess, but still
Scanian have the throat R as well
To a degree
My parents' generation seem to have an easier time understanding people from Norway and Sweden due to them having grown up watching TV from there
My generation seem alright
We can communicate with the others with some effort without switching to English, but it's not super easy
Norwegians are usually easier to understand as we share more words with them than we do with the Swedes
I'd imagine (though I don't actually know) that Cypriots consume a lot more Greek media than the other way around which would make them more familiar with how you speak
There’s a generational divide
My parents (I’m 17) grew up with Swedish TV
You had more channels since you’re twice as big as us
So most people of that generation has a decent understanding, while ours is pretty lost
I’ve watched so much SKAM that I have a decent understanding of both, though
So, yeah, the Scandinavian languages are pretty intelligible, but it requires some practice, which not everybody has
In today’s youth it’s whether you watched SKAM or not
Sorry for the confusion
I meant Kristiansand
Oh it definitely is mumbling
Yeah i was just speculating as to why that was the case
Norway
For being a very good example of how a natural resource can be used for the public good instead of pure profit, with their national oil fund
One of the things that annoy me most about our country's modern history is the government selling the oil extraction rights for areas of the North Sea instead of doing what Norway did decades later and nationalising the resource instead
The UK for their music and tv-shows
Taskmaster is a national treasure
I wanna thank the following countries:
* Poland: For supporting Austria-Hungary in the fight against the Ottomans
Great people with great work ethic
* Austria: Arnold Schwarznegger and their stand against the Ottomans

Prague is a great city and thanks for putting up with drunk Danish tourists
* Germany: All the technology and innovation and showing a country can rise again after a shameful past
* Switzerland: World class research, innovation etc
and show that a Liberalconservative uptopia is indeed possible
I really wanna visit the beautiful country one day, and I could even envision myself live there
* France: The culture and history speaks for itself
Also, is worth mentioning: Fashion
* Italy: Same with Italy with food and football as well
I am huge fan of Italian football (Ac Milan)
* Spain: Great football and a sexy language
I wanna thank them for their cultural and historic contribution
* Portugal: Nelly Furtado
* Belgium: Their chocolate
* Netherlands: Their liberal-progressive policies, it seems like it is in their DNA to be liberal-progressive, which I really admire
Their language is really underrated, and I admire their football
* United Kingdom: France, Italy and United Kingdom are the three mainpillars of European culture, in my opinion
You could add German and Spain as well
I wanna thank London for being a great city, where I got a surgery and their contribution to culture and language all over the world
For being by farthe best European NATO ally, that actually wants to spend money on their defense
I have to mention football as well
* Ireland: Irish people are some of the nicest people on earth, and their accent is really charming
I loved Dublin
* Greece: Birthplace of democracy and philosophy, I wanna thank them for their contribution to history and culture
Even though, Alexander the great invaded Persia

There is charm to the Balkans
I think that was that
Thank you to Sweden for all the wars we've had, I think our friendship today needed us to fight so much first
Yeeeeah we kinda did the small brain right there
You mean BBC
these days, david attenborough only narrates
Right back at ya svenskdjævel
Come have a beer in Cph sometime
You are like our mental challenged cousin
But you are still our cousin
Thank you for having such beautiful women
Norway will always be our little brother, imo
I thank Bulgaria for being in Golden Sands when I was 17 years old
First time I traveled alone with my buddy
It was quite an experience
Our market is more free than yours, we just have decided to have high taxes and a strong social security welfare model, but we still embrace capitaliscm
I wanna thank you for your contribution to science and also showing that you can have a succesful liberal society
In general phone adverts were pretty good
Now, they are just pure shit
Are you kidding me
Straight childhood memories> Moomin
I never lock my doors if I'm at home during the day
Generally, I remember to lock them at night or if I'm not at home, but not always, and it never bothers me if I don't tbh
Well the door can only be opened from the inside but I always lock the extra lock on the door
There are many homeless romas in my area and they often go into our courtyard to roam through our garbage if the main gate isn’t shut
Once inside the main gate it’s easy access to the apartments
I don't unless it's night, no matter what house or apartment I'm staying at / visiting / living in
Now, I don't have to at all, but I can't sleep knowing that someone could potentially just walk in and kill me at any time, even if no one will ever realistically try doing that
I have read too many creepy comment threads to not lock the door at night
During the day though
It's unlocked
Yes but only I have to because of how my door is made
Not generally no
I've only encountered one door in Denmark that locked automatically, and that was when I lived in a very shady dorm just outside of Copenhagen
Otherwise, it's not something our doors do
The same for me
I hate it when my car runs away
It is available in Denmark - I have seen it in apartments, and my parents old house had it as well
But I don't see it very often, and it's not something I would want for myself, since I imagine the kids would get locked out all the time
I only lock the door when everyone is leaving the house, or at night when we go to sleep
During the day, it's just not practical (I work from home a lot)

John gik gennem en mørk skov til et værtshus kun for at finde ud af, at han har glemt hans penge
MeToo
It’s both popular and controversial for a few reasons:
Some months ago, at an award show, a popular TV-host from our national broadcasting channel named Sofie Linde gave a speech where she revealed that a powerful colleague/boss at the channel had threatened her to *ruin her f-ing career if she didn’t suck his dick
This gave way to a rampage of sexual harassment accusations from journalists and politicians especially, essentially revealing/shedding light on the rotten culture and structural issues that “allow” powerful men to abuse their position to harass mostly younger female colleagues
Currently, there’s almost a new case in the media every day about someone revealing that he or she has been the victim of sexual harassment
Especially politicians are in the crossfire right now
It became increasingly controversial a few weeks ago when the leader of the social liberal party had to step down because a woman within the party revealed that he had grabbed her thigh 10 years ago
Many people found that completely ridiculous that he’d step down for “just that”, whilst other people found it appropriate since their party has probably been the most prominent party in the MeToo-debate
Now the mayor of Copenhagen has also stepped down because several accusations have been made about how gross he’s been towards female colleagues for over 20 years
What’s weird is that our foreign minister Jeppe Kofod had sex with a 15-year old intern (15 is legal here) and left her crying in the bedroom 12 years ago, and he hasn’t stepped down
Anyway it’s a whole shitshow, but it’s definitely a popular and controversial subject at the moment
Sexual assault, primarily amongst politicians
Two large cases were recently dug up from 10+ years ago, because who knows why
A political party-leader quit because of a 10-year-old case with him grabbing a woman on the thigh
Why has our world come to this
I was in Gothenburg two weeks ago, and it was so weird and interesting to see how differently the people are responding to COVID in Sweden vs
in Denmark
Here, the government has come down much harder with restrictions etc
which has transferred to the population and essentially made us more cautious/nervous in the public space
In Sweden, or Gothenburg at least, it seemed like people didn’t really mind being cramped up together in tight spaces, stores etc
And it was so funny to see everyone take off their masks the minute our train left Denmark and crossed the sound over to Sweden lol (masks are mandatory in public transport here)
Everyone was just so chill :)
Send snow plz
We haven't had a decent winter in flippin' YEARS
I would like to contest that a case is happening almost every day
As far as I know, there has only been three people that have been fired because of their misconduct
Frank Jensen, Morten Østergaard and Mads Danielsen
It's a huge news story in Denmark atleast
That could og course because the Muhammed drawing is from a danish newspaper
His party, the Social Democrats (who are the governing party atm), has a youth party called SDU
The SDU had some sort of seminar that took place at a boarding school (efterskole in Danish)
Jeppe Kofod participated at the seminar and at the party they threw afterwards
He then proceeded to have sex with this 15 year old who, it turns out, had been an intern with the Social Democrats only a few weeks prior
Witnesses said she was breaking down crying in the bedroom after he left, but she hasn’t pressed rape charges and he says it was consensual but that he’s sorry and that it shouldn’t have happened (obviously)
Regarding the Kofod case
It has to be mentions that it became a news item back then too, which is the reason why it's not a bigger deal now
About damn time
Hahahahaha, so true
Being from Iceland where everything went bananas during the original metoo wave
Almost nothing happened in Denmark
And now, suddenly, people are outraged
About fucking time
I see your point, but: Well first of all, there was also Orla Østerby and the unnamed guy from DR who Maria Fantino accused of asking her to have sex with his wife while he watched
And second, there are the 701 women who signed the Sofie Linde-letter, 300-something women who signed the letter saying there is sexism in the Parliament, 543 doctors and nurses who said the same thing about their field, 689 people who signed the letter saying there is sexism and harassment at the universities etc
etc
etc
Many of those women have openly revealed their experiences to the media, they just haven’t given any names
So yeah I would say there is more or less a new story somewhere in the media every day, whether or not they have led to someone being fired/stepping down is another story
Another thing: It only occurred to me a few days ago, but politicians actually cannot get fired since they are technically employed by the people
This is why the politicians in question have either stepped down due to immense pressure from the public or have had their political spokesman positions taken from them by the party
But essentially a politician can’t be fired
It makes sense, but it’s weird, right
Yup, same here during the summer
Now our government has just made it mandatory to wear masks in all public spaces and not just transport
Anyway, I hope it doesn’t get too bad in Sweden or Denmark (or anywhere else)
good good, let the hate ~~flow~~ **snow** through you
All indoor public spaces, just to clarify
Yeah it seems so
As of next Thursday to clarify even more
I think that all Universities here are seen as more or less equally prestigious
They are all free
Maybe some fields, that are hard to get in to or are viewed a harder study, are regarded higher than others
Depends on the field
For engineering fields and Computer Science, it would be Aalborg University, it is also ranked 4th in the world for those areas
For most other areas in technology it would be DTU
For business, it would be Copenhagen Business School (CBS)
For most other things, it would be Copenhagen University (KU) or Århus University (AU)
None are more prestigious than others, since they are all free
It depends heavily on what you want to study, as some fields are way more popular than others
If you talk "folkeskole", which is before high school (age 5-15/16) and high school, it's gotta be Herlufsholm, which is a private school combined with a boarding school
For students under the age of 13, one school year will cost the parents 42620 Danish crowns (6474 American dollars) while students over the age of 13 cost 53300 Danish crowns (roughly 8100 dollars)
Boarding students will cost 157000 Danish crowns (roughly 23850 dollars)
That might not sound that expensive compared to American private schools, but when you then look at the fact the average tax percentage per person in Denmark is 46%, you'll understand it's pretty expensive and prestigious
Hard to get into doesn't necessarily equate to a tougher curiculum
I study Medicine in Odense, easier to get into (I think) compared to Copenhagen (More people want to study in the capital)
But you have double as many exams in Odense
So prestige in admittance or curiculum varies
I think at most some universities have stereotypes associated with them - Like I went to RUC for example, so I've gotten a lot of "hippie jokes" throughout the years
But people have never assumed that my academic level was lower because I went there
When you are applying for jobs, which university you went to is irrelevant
People care more about what you studied
If you studied medicine at Copenhagen, nobody is going to assume you are any better than someone who studied it at Odense, even though Odense is easier to get into
Everybody knows the main reason Copenhagen is hard to get into is that it's the capital and nothing else
Plus the whole grade-average is so misleading
As far as I know, there's no university subject that has requirements for "minimum" grades you need to have - instead if 200 people apply and they only have room for 50, they just pick the 50 best
That means that if that 200 people have high grades, the grade average is high, but if they don't then it's low
It can change a lot from year to year that way
It also really depends on what you are studying
For instance, DTU has one of the largest selection of pilot plants for chemical and biochemical engineering studying(the summer usually has the hall full with foreign students coming just to run experiments there)
I tihnk the difference is Roskilde University is generally regarded as worse than the others
Other than that the difference is minor
Depends on what you study
Business
CBS
Technical stuff
DTU
Humanities
KU (University of Copenhagen
Even though, I have actually heard that Aarhus is better in the law department
I feel like university of southern Denmark is of lower tier and RUC is rock bottom
I'm a researcher in Computer Science
Most germans I see at conferences work at Max Planck Institute for Informatics
I think you're confusing prestige with leading a certain field
I think there's very little difference prestige-wise, except maybe for CBS and RUC being at the opposite ends of the scale
Precisely
For instance STEM Universities may be easier to get in to than antropology or midwife or psychology but it is based on popularity and not academic complexity
It is harder to get in to than for instance Århus, Ålborg or Odense,but that is mostly because more people want to study in Copenhagen
I don't think that people here view the other Universities as worse than Copenhagen
Also in Copenhagen we have different Universities for different fields and they are regarded as equal
In general, but if you look at certain areas it's different
For instance, Aalborg is currently ranked number 4 in the entire world for Engineering
Eh, Copenhagen and Aarhus are within 14 spaces of each other
Not that much better than Aarhus for instance
And ofc the universities are nota t the exact same rank, but I think the point is that, in spite of the difference in ranks, that doesn't translate into real prestige in Danish society
RUC is regarded as a hippy-dippy school, but I've never heard of it as being regarded as worse academically
Personally I've found that loads of employers prefer my RUC background because I'm used to big complicated projects, group work and interdisciplinary work
Personally I've gone to both KU and RUC and found that the level was about the same within the same subject, just different in teaching styles
One could argue that writing a 60+ pages dissertation each semester is harder than sitting in a classroom 8ish hours a week for the same amount of ects-points
It really just depends on the person, tbh
As a external lecturer at ITU, I think you are way off
RUC is by no means rock bottom and University of Southern Denmark has some real capacities
DTU excel in engineers, but DIKU and ITU are top Computer Science schools
Actually, the top 10 of studies, thst are the hardest to get in to, include Aarhus and Odense;
Hvis man ikke skriver Aalborg, burde man udvises
I don't mean RUC is literally worse but more it has a worse reputation
But maybe I'm exaggerating
I do know that people on r/denmark make fun of RUC almost as much as they do of people who study the humanities though, but they may not be the best source
I'm not saying ruc is trash, but if I have to compare RUC to it's peers, I think the consensus is that it is the lowest tier of em all
Yeah I forgot about ITU, i haven't really heard much from ITU, but considering the Danish IT sector is great, I think it's pretty great
University of southern Denmark as well have some capabilities, but I think AU & KU have more to offer
Linked Data / Semantic Web :)
That's a very ambitious school and very popular
I hope you have a great time
My girlfriend is a foreign student attending CBS
She says it is quiteambitious but not as great as she expected
Your mileage may vary tho
Udvises af Aalborg
Det går nok
r/ denmark is a fine enough sub to be on for fun, but they are def not the source for knowing what the general public thinks
It's widely considered that a somewhat big part of its users are objectively problematic at varying degrees (racism, bigotry, sexism, elitism or just general assholishness)
I use the sub myself, and I would never consider it the end-all-be-all for what people outside that sub thinks about anything
And the idea that humanities are somehow all "easy" subjects, which many on there seem to think, is honestly ridiculous and snobbish - and the same with RUC somehow being easy or a worse university than others
Like I said, outside of Reddit, I've never met people who honestly saw RUC as a university that "worse" or has a "bad reputation". At worst people might disagree with their teaching style or, again, associate it with the hippie movement
But it's no more than how people go: "oh so you are a douchebag" when they hear someone went to CBS
Yeah, I think you are overall right
I probably considered the "hippy" reputation and in my mind that was conflated with being a bad reputation
It really serves the general point that there are no major differences between Danish universities
I don't know the school firsthand, but I get the impression, that it is a hard school
Don't hesitate to ask, if you have questions about transferring to Denmark
> too hard
haha, yep
It's not a place you go to slack off
February is probably the worst month of the year, so pack a coat
But you will get to see beautiful spring in April and May
What I mean is: It's not a place to be if you're generally a slacker
Of course there'll be time for beers and gals/lads/entities of your preference
My High School had Erasmus students come and visit before Covid
But for the weather thing, it can get colder than that in Denmark (makes sense) but it’s usually around the -1 C to (at the coldest) -10 C in the winter and fall months
In most stadiums there are overhangs for just that, rain, so you should be good there, if it’s cold i’d dress accordingly
However, the theme-parks aren’t really the place to go to when raining
Most restaurants are indoors, so that’s good as well
Yes, a lot of the time it is cold and dark here, so you will find a lot of indoor sports and activities
Moldova, as a part of Romania, is plenty interesting
Moldova, as its own entity, completely disregarding Romanian history, has very little to write home about (literally)
Here's a thing to do in Slovakia
Drive along the E50 and count all the castles you see
You'll see more castles in a day than you'll see in years
Slovakia is amazing
Says the only flatter country ;)
I mean, if you care about the Viking age, especially in relation to England, most of that history has to do primarily with us
Denmark was actually also quite important in the early history of the Netherlands, particularly Frisia (The Danes destroyed the Frisian kingdom, which led to the absorbation of all the current Netherlands into the Frankish empire, which eventually led to the development of the Netherlands as we know them)
True, it's like Netherland, just nicer and cooler being Scandinavian/Nordic and all
Some of the [old buildings and canals] in Copenhagen have taken inspiration from the Dutch
I don't understand why tourists visit Sweden or Denmark, and I say that as a very happy Copenhagen resident who wouldn't want to live elsewhere
Coming here to study or live, sure, but a vacation destination
Norway is a beautiful country, though
Our highest point is actually lower than Netherlands' highest point, so they've even gotten us beat on that :(
Grenen is kinda cool, not often you can stand in two different seas at the same time
People generally visit Denmark *because* it's not spectacular and dramatic :D
Denmark is hygge and good things in a small package, not frost bites or dangerous animals, lol
The Vikings were from both Denmark *and* Norway (and Sweden, but shhh)
It is, however, true that the Vikings most people know about - I.e. the ones who invaded England and France - were almost entirely from Denmark
The Norwegians settled Ireland and Scotland and the north Atlantic, while the Swedes went east and founded Russia
Denmark is sandy beaches, friendly people, clean air/water, bike culture, amazing food, architecture, all hygge and no drama
At least that's why so many Germans, Norwegians, Swedes and Dutch people come here when asked why
Also about one million Americans fly to Copenhagen yearly
Actually Denmark has about the same number of foreign turist nights as Sweden and Norway combined
Copenhagen almost the same number as whole of Norway
Don’t ruin my joke with facts
>Our highest point is actually lower than Netherlands' highest point
The state of Denmark's highest point is Gunnbjørns Fjeld on Greenland, which is 3,694 m.
People are uptight in the other Nordics
Sweden maybe, but the rest seem chill to me
Not really though
You'll find ships, great halls, rune stones and ring fortresses in especially Denmark but also Norway and Sweden
But Iceland of course has the old style language and little horses
The Kievan Rus were the result of viking explorers (Varangians) from Sweden establishing chiefdoms along their trade-routs down the eastern Rivers, with Norse elites ruling over Slavic subjects
Even the name "Rus" originally referred to Swedish vikings, from an Old Norse word related to rowing
The Finnish name for Sweden, for instance, is "Ruotsi", which is probably derived from the same word
There are also several places in the part of Sweden closest to Russia that have names evidently deriving from *Rus* (or vice versa)
Russia's Norse origins have been mostly forgotten, partly because the connection stopped being renewed after the 11th century, and partly because Russian nationalism suppressed the idea that their country might have been founded by Swedes (who were, remember, historic enemies of Russia)
The first two rulers of the Kievan Rus, Rurik and Igor, both have Norse names (Rurik is from Old Norse Hrǿríkr, while Igor is a Slavic rendition of the name Ingvar
Both are mentioned in the Sagas
Uhh a swede, let’s rally against the swedes
I have also heard that, Danes were the "Italians" of Scandinavia and Swedes the "Germans". Norwegians were the "Brits" or something
Oh, I wasn't trying to convince him
I was agreeing with him :)
Denmark is officially claiming the North Pole (the EEZ)
Yeah, "Good for you
" is a funny one and it clearly also depends on the tone in English
You sometimes hear it in movies and stuff, where an American (or whatever) will say "I got a new job
" or "I got into Yale
" or whatever and the other person will say "Good for you
:D" in a genuinely nice way
"Godt for dig
" (the Danish variant) sounds sort of dismissive and sarcastic, and it'd likely be used in situations like someone bragging, or someone being upset with you
Since we generally love sarcasm in Denmark, even the sarcastic usage *can* be used in a kidding kinda way towards friends and stuff though
Yeah, "Jeg elsker dig
" also seems more "serious" and intimate than "I love you
" does in English
Americans especially (judging from books, movies, online interactions etc
) seem to use it all the time, even as a "Bye" when on the phone to family members etc
If a relative is dying in a hospital bed you might also say it suppose, and it wouldn't really be weird but that's obviously also a *very* serious situation and you may never see the person again
And then there's drunk friends of course, who knows what they might say
But if they're sober it just comes across as strange (although not rude) for a friend to tell you that he loves you
It has happened to once in my 30+ years on the planet, and I still remember the moment very clearly because it just took me by surprise and was very strange to me
I didn't really know how to react
Danish teenagers and stuff will often use "I love you
", "love you
" or whatever on their social media profiles etc
as that just seems "lighter" and a bit less serious than "Jeg elsker dig
" due to media influence
We're the least perceptibly corrupt country in the world
We still have a lot of politicians who have their own private foundations, where companies and people can donate money to get to meet and speak with the politician
So while we don't have a lot of the usual corruption seen elsewhere in the world, we do have quite a bit of "hidden" corruption
Apparently, Denmark happens to be the least corrupt country in the whole world
Granted I still believe that small instances of corruption occur on a smaller scale here
No matter what society you may inhabit, there’s bound to be at least a minuscule amount of corruption
The least corrupt in the world
The least corrupt in the world, despite several cases of breach of trust
Denmark is usually considered the least corrupt country in the world, probably because it is near impossible
Apparently one of the least corrupted countries if not the least corrupt overall, although corruption is rising and we wish there was less corruption, corruption has grown in recent years at long from what people tell me and listening to the news
[Very little]
> Ask any not-brainwashed Russian and he will tell you about that
This dynamic has always interested me
It seems like Russians fall into two categories: trusting the state and refusing to see any problem or seeing the whole system for what it is; highly corrupt
And even worse we gave away DONG to Goldman Sachs in a corrupt deal and had an employee single handedly give someone €1
5 billion as a tax return
We are not as squeaky clean any longer
You jumped to 1st in 2018 from 5th in 2017

We'll see as more people join if it gets toxic
There’s also South Ossetia at 53k and Guernsey at 63k
The first one is recognized by Russia, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Nauru and Syria
Well there's a lot of contenders for Denmark, in my opinion
But if I should put something which I think most danes whould agree on atleast being a contender I'd probably pick this song: Kim Larsen - ["Om lidt"]
This is a song which is often a stable of danish funerals
It's about the ending of a big show
I have taken the liberty to translate the lyrics, keep in mind that I have translated nothing but the meaning
The rhyme scheme and number of syllabels are not consistent with the danish version
The original danish lyrics can be found [here
&#x200B;
\[Verse 1\]
Soon it'll be quiet
Soon it'll be over
Did you get to see what you wanted
Did you get to hear your melody
\[Verse 2\]
Abandoned and alone
The princess of the circus dances
Stops up on her line
Ind an unfathomable second
\[Chorus\]
Soon, soon
We will be gone
Maybe we'll see eachother again
\[Verse 3\]
Soon it'll be quiet
Soon it'll be over
Did you get to see what you wanted
Did you get to hear your melody
\[Chorus\]
Soon, soon
We will be gone
Maybe we'll see eachother again
Soon, soon
We will be gone
Maybe we'll see eachother again
Probably [Agnes Obel - Riverside] (live version, since original has been removed from Youtube for some reason)
It got a lot of international or at least continental wide European traction as well
Defo Sissel, i loooove her voice
I live in Copenhagen and in many ways, it's great - a good balance of green areas and city
Lots of culture and stuff to do
Public transport is great and getting around the city is easy - especially on a bike
Also unless you go to the super touristy spots, it doesn't seem overly populated
The main negative is how expensive it is
Both in terms of food and drink, as well as rent and stuff
In fact, the rent issue is so bad I'm leaving the city soon to move to mainland Denmark, as even with all the good stuff and how much I love it here, it isn't worth it
Even with a decent pay, you should expect half+ to go to rent, and then you wouldn't even get that much space or quality of the amount of money you pay
Went to Kraków last summer and absolutely fell in love with the city
I totally get why you would love your city too much to leave it - what a gem it is
I've lived here for 7 years studying, and there's no denying Copenhagen is beautiful and I've honestly enjoyed living here a lot
But if your job prospects are anywhere near regular and you don't have a solid network or pure dumb luck, you have to give up A LOT to live here
Especially since that "city's beauty" isn't too different from what you can find in, say, Århus (having lived very close to there as well, the only real difference of note is that Copenhagen is more exposed internationally and more hyped up nationally
Everything Copenhagen has to offer, Århus has something similar)
Say you make 30
000kr each month - that's higher than the national average and a decent wage to start with as someone with a master's. You would have 19500kr post-tax in most cases then
Likely you might pay at least 10
000kr of those to just rent (more if you want anything above 50m2), leaving you with 9500kr to pay utilities, food, insurance, transport, A-kasse, Fagforening, internet, phone, license and so on
The average cost of that per person is between 6000-8000kr
Leaving you with a maximum of 3500kr each month to put away for unforeseeable expenses and larger bills (dentist, new bike, whatever), as well as just money for regular things like clothes and Netflix and whatever
It's doable, but it's shitty and your prospects are basically live like that forever, get lucky and find something super cheap (unlikely unless you have a great network or was born under a lucky star) or take out a huge loan and buy a small apartment
And tbh, in my case, I just don't think it's worth it
It's likely also because I didn't grow up in Copenhagen so my family isn't here and most of my friends are moving due to being done studying and getting new jobs all over the country
Also, I kinda don't want to live paycheck to paycheck the rest of my life just so I can live in Copenhagen
I want a house at some point, a garden, things like that
And I can get a huge apartment in loads of places in Jylland near big cities like Århus, for less than half the price of a tiny one-bedroom in Copenhagen and thus still have access to all that Copenhagen has to offer, just in Århus instead
(Sorry about the rant, I'm done with my masters in a few months so it's on my mind a lot atm, haha)
My friend goes to Kraków every year (she's to one who took me there last year) and she speaks of the city just like you do :) We both are taking our masters in history, so it really is the perfect city for people like us
Absolutely gorgeous city
Unless you've rented or owned for a while (at least 10-20 years, which her grandfather likely has), is part of a boligforening (most of which have waiting lists of over 30 years), then all housing in Copenhagen or the greater Copenhagen is super expensive
In fact, even the cities around Copenhagen are equally expensive to the city
Take Virum, for example, the prizes there are the same as Copenhagen, but it's around 30 km away from Copenhagen
Or Hillerød, almost 50 km from Copenhagen but the same prices for housing as most of Copenhagen as well
That being said, Hvidovre - due to it not being a very desired place to live - is a bit less expensive than Copenhagen
Here you might pay 8500-9500 kr for 50m2 next to the minimum 10
000kr in Copenhagen (no utilities added in either of those examples)
However, if you look at a city like Århus, or maybe Randers (30 minutes from Århus by train, so around the same as Hviodre/Copenhagen only Randers is much bigger than Hvidovre), the average rent for 50m2 is 2500kr (Randers city center) or 5000-6000kr (Århus city center)
So yeah, to me, the financial struggle that comes with living in Copenhagen, really isn't worth it, when you can get more for less and even get the same benefits that Copenhagen brings, in other cities
I'm also a student - I get by with a student job and my SU
Like I wrote, I'm simply doing the math atm due to being done with my masters in December, when yes - I will start a different part of my life where making 30
000kr before tax, 19000kr after (low but decent starting wage for my education) and realistically only having the option of living in a 50m2 apartment with rent over 11500kr utilities included isn't the dream
And the quality of life, lifestyle and general feeling here, you can get in Århus as well, without breaking the bank to just have more than a tiny one-bedroom apartment with hardly even being able to afford the the option to go out for a drink every once in a while
You are a native, I get loving your hometown - I love mine as well
But Copenhagen really isn't that different from other large Danish cities
Nothing's wrong with Hvidovre at all :) I lived there when I first moved to Sjælland and have a boyfriend there now
It's lovely - it's more snobbery than anything else
I remember once someone on the Denmark subreddit wrote about how he was doing an exchange and had gotten a room in Hvidovre and what there was to do in the area, and all the comments were basically: "the only thing there is to do is grab your things, walk to the train station and go to Copenhagen". That's the general attitude
Other than that I found Hvidovre lovely
I used the km my company uses when registering our km pay, they might be off, but that the one my company claims is from Kongens Nytorv (where my workplace is) to the areas
I just checked apartment rent prices for Roskilde, though, and on both sites, I used they are no lower than the ones in Hvidovre (sometimes higher, even)
Hedehusene, however, I'll agree is cheaper
That being, it's clear you really love Copenhagen, which I understand
But this is my opinion
I'm entitled to it - I always wrote it isn't worth it TO ME
It might be to you, and that's fair
Two big ass dams
One between Scotland and Bergen in Norway, over the Shetlands and one between Dover and Calais
Then a couple of pumps so we can drain the Baltic and the North Sea and reclaim Doggerland
The dutch can be in charge, wth assistance from Northern Germany and Denmark
A train network, just as the one in japan, with all major cities connected
I think EU will help with the metro connection Copenhagen-Malmø and the Femern Belt connection, but I don't know the largest infrastructure project EU should build
It's already super expensive to be member of the EU, so EU shouldn't really use more money, but we are lacking super computers and space exploration/construction in EU
The sad thing is that the European interrail used to be better than it is now
Femern Belt construction starts in Denmark January 2021
We are waiting on Germany to connect the country from North to South
No they'd just get the land they already own there (by sea)
Nah
we don't really fight much up here
Never have
We're peacefull people
Yeah, that was my inspiration
It's just such a ridiculous project, but would be so awesom if it was ever build
Yeah
Damns for everyone
Although I recon Russia might have a word or two to say about getting a wee tad longer way to the atlantic for their fleets
Greater Copenhagen is turning into a metropolitan region with 4
3 million inhabitants
The train is nice and was a good start, but it takes 39 minutes from the Central Station to Malmø C according to the Journey planner
It's also needed to free up space on the Øresund connection to allow more freight through when the Femern Belt connection opens to Germany
The metro connection will be more direct to Malmø and only take about half the time of the train
And metro just feels more integrated and city like
The connection is currently in the fourth stage of planning and the expectation is that it could be ready by 2035 and cost 30 billion Danish kroner
It's just too expensive
Denmark is expected to send about 26 billion kroner (3
5 billion euro) to EU from next year, and we are getting less and less back from EU
It's crazy that the budget is not adjusted to the UK leaving and now EU even wants to borrow extra money, that we are responsible to pay back
There should be a hard cap of maximum 200 euro per capita in net contribution
The other route
Do you mean Fynen-Jutland-Germany
The train has five stops between the Central Station and Malmø C, and it goes in a big arch instead of a straight line
It runs every 20 minutes in the day
The biggest problem is not EU using more money on economic recovery and green climate
I'm not a fan of sending free money to the South, but on the other hand I don't really care
The problem is how EU is borrowing money which the member states are responsible for paying back
That is more federalisation
The increase in EU money spending could be solved simply by a hard cap of maximum 200 euro per capita in net contribution
Then countries like Denmark and Netherlands will not be hit harder than we already are
We need the big countries like France and Germany to start to pay up as well as other rich countries like Finland and Belgium, that are not contributing (net) very much
The hard cap I'm talking about would solve just that
Protecting the hardest hit countries while enabling EU to continue to spend a lot of money, where EU thinks it's needed the most
*We* should leave, because *you* want to spend more money
How about Ireland start contributing instead
The net contributions of Denmark, Netherlands, Germany in 2019 were around 175 euro per capita
Ireland: 5
5 euro per capita
Finland: 101 euro per capita
Is Ireland still a poor country
Finland is certainly same rich as Denmark but is still not contributing very much
We are talking about net contributing, so Finland and Ireland don't nessiarily need to send more money to EU - just receive less - and EU would have more money to redistribute elsewhere
But when will enough be enough
Right now there is not an upper limit to how much countries have to pay
26 billion kroner is not pocket change in Denmark
Maybe we'll do as you want and simply do as Norway, that pays much less than Denmark and still get to sell their stuff and study and live in EU
Who is that *we* that destroyed the Greek economy a decade ago
Remember we are not part of the eurozone
Edit: The four Danish opt-outs
You are not really answering the question when enough will be enough about how the member states can be asked to pay to EU
It's rather easy to ask others to send more when it's not your money
I find the 200 euro per capita to be a good compromise as only Denmark and Netherlands to my knowledge have exceeded that amount
Even this year no country is above 200 euro
If I understand your answer correctly, you don't want to set an upper limit, because you claim, that the ROI is positive
In other words you don't care how much money countries like Denmark and Netherlands can be asked to send to EU, not matter what we would prefer to use it on in our own countries
Your ROI claim is based on the poorer countries buying things from richer countries
You are forgetting you don't need to be an EU member to export to these countries, and that you can't be sure where they buy their things
To follow your logic we could say that instead of Denmark sending so much money to EU, EU could instead choose Danish export articles to be sent to countries in need of them
Denmark would then pay Danish companies directly that amount we otherwise don't get back from EU
That would be a win-win
>Hey, if you give me €20 I'll give you €50" and you'd say "BUT I WANT TO SPEND THE €20 ON MYSELF".
Hey, give me 50 euro and I'll give you 20 euro back, you can spend on what I decide you can spend it on
Then I'll use the leftover 30 euro on my life enjoying friends, hoping they use the money more wisely to turn it into 40 euro somehow, so they maybe will buy your expensive things instead of any cheaper alternative
Could you try and understand I'm not against sending 50 euro to EU
But not more than 50 euro when other similar rich countries only send 30 or 40 euro
When they reach 50 euro, then we can sit down and talk about if it's enough or if it would make sense raising the limit it to 60 euro
Not much within our borders but on a sidenote Finland does exist
The truth is out there
Sincerely a Dane
Fyn is just a highway connecting Denmark and Sweden (Sjælland/Zealand)
In newer history it would be Magrethe, Christian and Frederik thats about it
for boys: Harald, Gorm, Valdemar, Christian, Frederik, Svend, Christoffer, Erik, Knud
For girls: Margrethe
Christian, Frederick, Margrethe, Hans, Christoffer, Erik, Oluf, Valdemar, Abel, Knud (Canute), Niels, Harald, Svend, Magnus, Hardeknud and Gorm are the Danish options
Guess I only have one choice if it’s a girl and that’s Margrethe
If you include from the start of the kingdom then it would be
Gorm, Harald, Svend, Knud, Hardeknud, Magnus, Oluf, Erik, Niels, Valdemar, Abel, Christoffer, Margrethe, Hans, Christian, Frederik
With the fabled kings:
Halfdan (Dan for Danmark), Gram, Siger, Angantyr, Hroar, Hygelac, Helge, Frode
is Elizaveta the same name as Elisabeth or is it pronounced differently
Frederikke would be the proper way, at least in Danish and I think Swedish as well
Even though the queens were not monarchs by blood I suppose they became monarchs through their marriage (correct me if I'm wrong)
This means that names like Thyra (wife of Gorm the old), Ingrid, Caroline Mathilde, Dagmar and in the future the name Mary could be added to the list
Edit: nevermind, I'm wrong
~~Hardeknud is considered a lengendary king by most people~~
Edit: My bad, there is a non-legendary hardeknud
I would properly say no to this
The monarch is the the ruler of the reign or kingdom and the other half is the consort
How so
Hardeknud was son of Knud the great ruler of Denmark and England
Yeah, you're right
My bad, thank you though
Oh yeah my bad
I remembered Gorm's father Hardeknud:
You are assuming people would know where Dora was from and not naturally assume that she is mediterranean
She does have a stereotypical mediterranean name
The show does not exactly scream 'Murica
>Swiper
Maybe in English but here in Denmark hugo is not clearly an American
Hugo må ikke hugge (Hugo is not allowed to "take/swipe")
The idea of a soft k is one of the many reasons why Sweden sucks
In my city personally it’s weather the new buildings we have should have an old style or a modern style
Stylistically important but the house should function the same, just with different visual architectures
You can have a soft G but not K, AFAIK
Some people in Denmark thinks you crush your kammerjunker when eating koldskål or you don't put them in first, but that's because they are mistaken them for tvebakker
Some Danish exsmples would be
Brown sauce or no brown sauce in a beef sandwich
Wether a The birkes is a pastry or bun
Marmelade or creme in a spandauer/ carnival bun
My brother puts the butter on the side with holes
He says its because he likes that the butter goes in the holes, but I say it's because he's insane
Old and classic all the way
I don’t dislike moderne buildings, but a lot of the time it’s an excuse to build uncreative and boring concrete blocks
Those damn socialists/walloons/Flemish nationalists/antwerpians/people who shop at aldi/bmw drivers/vegans/recreational cyclists/virologists/MeToo movement/unions/company cars/muslims/priests/covid restrictions/education system/government/road network/landlords
They ruined Belgium
My girlfriend is a monster who puts butter under Nutella
I wish I knew that before we bought a house together
We all know Swedish is elf language
Try the speaker symbol on the normal language, and you can see soft K is not used
Not if it's not frozen
Like others have already mentioned, small ~~world~~ country
knowing someone who knows someone
There's a pretty good handful of celebrities where either one of my friends knows one, or a friend's friend knows them
Also works with random people
For example, a few months ago me and some friends were playing CSGO, when a Danish guy was on our team
I then found out that he knew multiple of my friends, and even went to a school nearby
We have the ability to learn multiple labguages
We obviously learn Danish
Learn English from about 6 years old in school, choose between German or French at age 11
Then at highschool, you may learn Spanish, and some places you can learn Mandarin
Do you guys still learn Danish at school
Or rather, is Danish still widely spoken on Iceland
yeah you always meet people that either went to your friend's efterskole, or happened to live 5km from where you grew up
it's almost uncanny aha
Sadly, the thing that makes me know where Sarajevo is located is that it was where the Temple of Nod was located in the Tiberium Wars series
Yeah, why bother memorising all these small countries, when Russia's gonna incorporate them all in 2022
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
I have always thought is was firben (lizard) in Danish, which means fourlegs
So that was the most distinct about the animal
It has four legs
Mariehøne (Marie Hen) - Ladybug
Næsehorn (Nose horn) - Rhino
Flodhest (River Horse) - Hippo
Jordegern (Dirt Squirrel) - Chipmunk
Pindsvin (Stick Swine) - Hedgehog
Hulepindsvin (Cave Stick Swine) - Porcupine
Vaskebjørn (Washing Bear) - Raccoon
Sommerfugl (Summer Bird) - Butterfly
Vandmand (Water Man) - Jellyfish
Næbdyr (Beak Animal) - Platypus
Søko (Sea Cow) - Manatee
Vildsvin (Wild Swine) - Boar
A spider is an edderkop (venom cup)
A sloth is a dovendyr (lazy animal)
Most marsupial names in Danish are just the name of a completely unrelated placental animal with "pung-" in front ("pung" means pouch in this context)
Examples:
* Opossum = pungrotte ("pouch rat")
* Water opossum = pungodder ("pouch otter")
* Numbat = pungmyresluger ("pouch anteater")
* Possum = pungegern ("pouch squirrel", though one species is called "pouch fox")
* Quoll = pungmår ("pouch marten")
Also, tufted ducks and king crabs are called "troldand" (troll duck) and "troldkrabbe" (troll crab) respectively, though I fail to see their resemblances with trolls
In Danish they are "lazy animals"
Almost no other land animal has four legs, right
So that's a wrap
Well to be fair, a strong military is kinda important when you want to stay neutral in the middle of a continent that’s had quite a few wars
How are you going to stay neutral if you can be invaded just like that
Ok thought you meant during the Cold War
I don’t know, call me old fashioned but I think there’s a good point in everyone (or potentially everyone) participating in the defense of the country for a while
We have conscription for men in Denmark too, but they need so few (ie the defense don’t get more money) that basically every conscript is a volunteer these days
Barbie Girl by Aqua probably
Although the lead singer is Norwegian, the band itself is Danish
Catchy, famous and overplayed
Definitely [Nede Mette] This one is a guily pleasure to me
A story about normal girl (Mette) who grows up to be a party girl and sleeps a different place every day
The hook/title is a word play on her name, it means ‘down with it’.
Øhm
Laid back - sunshine reggae
Thats a danish group too
Yeah
that was a bit embarrassing
More recently, but not quite as big, I would also say Lucas Graham - 7 Years
It was ok to begin with, but got played too much and now nobody really wants to hear it anymore
You´re from Sweden and you dont mention like 3-4 Abba songs that fit that criteria
None of what you mentioned comes even close to Waterloo, Super Trooper, Mamma Mia or Money Money
I cant watch it in my country :(
Wow, I had completely forgotten about that song - thanks man
Feel so sad that I can’t find pewds version on spotify
Thats not really what OP asked for
KODA (a Music organisation that make sure musicans are getting paid for their music) recently made a lot of music unavailable in Denmark - it’s really annoying
Gasolina is terrible
^^I ^^love ^^it
Oh, is *that* why my YT playlists are suddenly riddled with unplayable tracks
I went to listen to a playlist I made ages ago and now only 5/20 songs are available
Yep
I originally understood it as only being danish artist but it’s a lot more than just them
And it’s not all songs either
Like I love some of Tessa violets songs and some are available and others aren’t
Yep, it's because KODA is also responsible for the licensing of a lot of foreign songs when they are being played in Denmark
And since Google and KODA aren't good friends right now, everything that has to do with KODA is blocked at the moment
There are many, but at this point I will just mention "Letbanen" in Århus, which is basically a tram service
They have postponed it multiple times, they have crashed, run people over, and so on
Overall it has been nothing but bad press for Århus
Everything related to trains
We're not even electrified yet, and electrification is over budget and over time, because we're using an experimental system
We're getting an experimental signalling system, which is also billions over budget and over time
It will be more than a decade late
Not to mention our last set of trains, which were supposed to replace the old ones twenty years ago
They're still not running fully, and will be obsolete before they ever start running
The whole system is fucked, has been fucked for decades, and will be fucked for decades to come
Also, never buy trains from Italy
Oh yeah, and Copenhagen just got a new metro line, which has been many years late and billions over budget
Aarhus just got a tram line which was also several years late
I'm happy I own a car
It Also feels like every single highway and train tracks/station is atleast 2 years delayed
Absolute shitshow that one
The worst part is when they came out and said it couldn't run in cold weather
This is a bit ridiculous
Why would Australians blame Siemens just because they deliver technology to an Indian owned coal mine in Australia
Surely Australians should blame the Australian government if they don't want them to dig up coal
If you don't have a drivers licence or a passport you can get an official ID card with a picture on it
The healthcare card is not really an ID card
It depends on where you live
In Copenhagen, a lot of people only have the healthcard, outside most use their drivers licenses as their main ID
I grew up in Jylland and moved to CPH and was honestly baffled when I learned a driver's licenses isn't something everybody simply has
And I know my other friends who moved to CPH from other places in Denmark had the same reaction
I, of course, get it from a practical level, but it was simply mind-boggling because of how ingrained it is as "rite of passage" outside CPH
While getting my haircut yesterday, my barber told me that his brother, just bought a bunch of canned food
Hand sanitizer is sold out pretty much everywhere, but apart from that it's business as usual
Semi-related side note: I bought a six-pack of toilet paper when I was out shopping today, because we ran out in the guest bathroom
I guess I'm part of the hoarding hordes now
Well, not every country has the alpes melting into our water tap
Was mostly a sarcastic comment, basic infrastructure won't be allowed to fail
Hell would break loose
Forelsket
It means to be "in love" but only in the euphoric way
On the other hand the ugliest word is probably Ørred, a trout
We have a similar word in Danish: "Udlængsel", which is a combined word from "ud" and "længsel" meaning "out" and "longing".
For some reason that reminded me of Aising Bea explaining how ["Irish people naturally all think they're good singers because of the natural sadness in our necks
Well, they *do* call radio "kringkasting" ("Round-throwing"), so you're not *completely* off your rocker
Udlængsel :)
No, gulebøj means yellow bend
gul=yellow bøj=bend
And it's actually Norwegian, although a made up word from Sweden
It's becomming fairly popular in [Denmark
> Here are some examples
Lol, there was a kid called Loki
"Hey hon, have you seen Hades or Baal recently
Those sound great to me
Why would you hate your own culture
The English examples you mentioned sound fine, too
They're not even old-fashioned in the typical sense, since they weren't common with the older generations either
They might not fly today, but that seems unfortunate more than anything
At any rate, considering ones own traditional names ugly seems to me like cultural self-loathing
Joaquin Phoenix's siblings are called River (deceased), Rain, Liberty, and Summer
He apparently called himself Leaf at one point
Nothing tops Moses and Apple for weird sibling names, though
I wouldn't call a God a fantasy character (unless they are named after the Marvel guy, which, to be fair, isn't too unlikely)
Calling your kid Tor or Freja or Balder isn't uncommon either
It's just that Loki is
not the God you'd want to name your kid after
"Ah yes, the horse-fucking semi-demonic transvestite
That'd be a good name for my unborn son
I mean, Thor, Freja and Balder are all quite common names in Denmark
Dylan and Angus are also names from mythology, the same goes for Alexander and basically every biblical name
I get that giving ones kid a very unusual name would be awkward, but to me that has nothing to do with it being an ugly name in and of itself
We don't really have the problem in Danish though, as far as I deem - mythological/Norse names aren't common for the most part, but I have a hard time thinking of one that would be very weird
Hjalmar and Ragner are rare but not odd, and Torkild or Torbjørn sound Norwegian more than anything
Well, it's no coincidence, is it
The name is popular in France > France is viewed as classy > Working-class people have a tendency to give their children "exotic" and/or "wealthy" names, presumably to compensate > they give their kids French names > French names become associated with over-compensating working-class people
Carlbergium yeast that stabilised beer production around the world
Insulin
Lego
Windmills
Electromagnetism
Lego
Maybe not as revolutionary as some of the other examples in this comment section, but we're pretty damn proud of it
Probably the pH scale, otherwise i would say the Gram staining of bacteria
I'm just here to say the Norwegian cheese slicer is way inferior to the wire cheese slicer
the pH scale as well
Also, one that not many Danes know, programming language c++ (Bjarne Stroustrup)
And the modern speaker
I love the balance
Insulin, which has probably saved 1000s of life and then Lego, a literal toy
So basically: Germans love physics
But we got LEGOs
And before that with ZPI insulin, meaning the actual inventions that allowed insulin to have a longer lasting effect, essentially their invention made insulin a viable treatment, where it previously was just a thing
Possibly :) didn’t invent that much, discovered a lot
I thought a Dane of all people would know that the plural of LEGO is LEGO, not LEGOs
Ok but Bluetooth is named after a Danish king, so it's basically Danish
Right
I'd rather not get highway tolls
Sucks enough to pay to cross the bridge
Poor Sweden :'(
I think that's a bad idea
However environment regulations could make sense in a combined EU
Also, the vast majority of rail traffic is domestic
There are lots of sunk costs that will have to be paid to achieve something relatively marginal
Did you guys throw us out of Scandinavia without telling us
When the other Scandinavian (and Nordic) countries went for state control of the alcohol market, Denmark decided to massively increase the tax on liquor instead
If I remember my alcohol history correctly
Thankfully not, and it's very cheap too (compared to Sweden and especially Norway) Although snus is banned here
There's a saying that Swedes drive across the bridge for alcohol, and we drive across the bridge for skiing and snus
That's just a Jutland thing, I think
I know they think they're the entire country, but don't listen to 'em
But you can buy snus in most kiosks though
Don't listen to this Swede-pretend-Dane
Jutland is the only part of Denmark that is actually Danish
IIRC it's not the same thing that's sold i sweden
But im not a snus connoisseur so im not 100% sure
That doesn't mean that we're not part of Scandinavia
In danish the term “feltmadras” (directly translated “field mattress”) is used to describe danish women who slept with the occupying german forces
I think the closest thing to it was "tyskerpiger" which translates to German girls
It was used to describe Danish girls who dated or married Nazi soldiers
There were also other names like "feltmadrasser" which translates to field mattresses
It was also for Danish girls who dated or married Nazi soldiers
I believe there were some grandchildren of those girls who found a mattress in their garden, this might have happened multiple times
But when it comes to Nazism, Danish comedian Martin Nørgaard really described it well, when he said "The scary wasn't that it happened, the scary thing was how common it was"
A collaborator who ratted people (mostly resistance fighters) out to the Germans was called a "stikker"
It is difficult to translate
Stik means "stab" and "give", so it means someone who both stabs you in the back and gives you up to the police
If you rat your partner-in-crime out to the police, you're a "stikker"
If you rat your schoolmate out to the teacher, you're a "stikker"
Many Danish women were ratted out as having had affairs with German officers and they were alle spat on and had their hair shaven off
They were just called whores
It's not really a used insult anymore though
I suppose you could call a woman a "feltmadras" today but it just wouldn't make any sense so it's not really done
It's absolutely an insult though but an outdated one since the relevance of it is gone
They were called feltmadrasser (field mattress') in Denmark
I am danish but speak danish as a second language (Due to some bad advice from a doctor, I never was taught to speak danish growing up)
For the past 5 years I've been trying my hardest to learn danish, it was a huge hurdle to get danish people to actually speak to me in danish because many of them preferred to speak to me in english because they could already speak english, even my own mother
My grandmother was the one exception though because she doesn't speak english
It took about 4 of the 5 years to get good enough to have people tolorate my danish enough to have a convorsation with me
&#x200B;
So yea, I used to think it was a bad thing, but now I think that is just how it is
However, the origional poster is right, it is fun to speak danish (or mandarin, my third language) as a "secret" around non-speakers
But honestly, I've given it some thought and it would be super cool if there was an international language that nobody spoke as a native language
totally, when me a danish person speaks english with a french guy its becuse we where colonised
Limbo, inside, Hitman series, Subway surfers, space hulk 2013, mini ninjas
So that's why ETS is so good, it's not from Germany ;)
> the original Max Payne
Fuuuuck yeeees
Hotline Miami and Payday too
That's how you know it's a good game
The use of Gyöngy hajúlány in the trailer cemented it as an amazing game
As part of a feminism campaign a journalist decided to make yoghurt based on bacteria from her lady parts
She then proceeded to ask people to taste it and later tell people about it
If they got mad then she would blame people for not supporting feminism
Jesus, this is why feminists have such a bad reputation
I very much consider myself a feminist, but this lady is just nuts
Yep
Joking about feminists is a cheap shot because "everyone knows" we're "crazy". Stunts like vagina yoghurt really don't help
I watched the first couple of episodes, but I didn't get hooked
Maybe it was because I was too tired, and I shoud probably give it another chance
I recently saw another German series on Netflix though, called Tribes of Europe
That's a good one as well, and I enjoy refreshing my German language skills (or lack thereof)
Thanks Germany for the cheap everything just across the border
I'd like to thank Germany for the border, Denmarks only land border, wich was settled by voting, and for their cheap candy just on the other side of the border
Thank you for inventing the Cheese slicer, Norway
I want to thank Germany and Feroya islands for their amazing food
We Danes do not like Sweden though
Not winning world war 2
I'd like to thank Sweden for keeping our soldiers occupied for the entire lifetime of both our countries
Thank you Sweden for all your furniture, kitchens, tables, chairs etc
Thanks you Germany for your cheap everything and awesome autobahn
I second this
During the occupation by the Germans, many Danish jews fled to Sweden who accepted the refugees
don't forget Belgium
Ain't cheap bro
In Denmark we love what we call "Sport soda" which are sodas like 7up or Mountain Dew but quite different in taste
The most beloved one is Faxe Kondi but there are also Carlsberg Sport, Jolly Time and some others
Americans would probably call these sodas tasteless
I feel like we have a surprising amount of soda producers considering how small a nation we are
My own hometown of 9 000 inhabitants has two soda production companies
Faxe Kondi is legendary in Denmark
It's like sprite but better
It used to sponsor the major Football (soccer) league and even has a song dedicated to it
A soda would be Faxe Kondi, which probably is the most popular here besides Coca Cola
But we also have a huge variety of energy drinks and soda-flavoured alcohol which are only sold here
FAXE KONDI
[Faxe Kondi] It's kinda like Sprite but more mild, very popular
They also make [energy drinks] which imo are *way* better than Monster or anything else
We have Tuborg Squash (orange soda) that is more or less as popular as Fanta and Hancock Sport Cola which is a mix between cola and lemon-lime soda (Sprite)
We also have Jolly Cola which for many years was more popular than Coca Cola in Denmark
You can get Irn Bru in like 2 shops over here
It's great, I buy a can when I see one
But not as good anymore since they changed the recipe
I had it when I went to Slovakia
Got addicted
I'm sad now because I can't get it here
I spent 2 weeks in Germany and had Apfelschorle every day, and I have never had it before or since then
It is without a doubt the most delicious beverage to fizzle my tastebuds
Cocio is great, but I think Danes sometimes forget Cocio is Danish due to the commercials always being in British English, and when you buy a can they are likely never produced in Denmark
Cocio is great - the only trouble is that it seems to evaporate in a few seconds after you open a bottle
The standard F size bottles you often get as a deal with a hotdog just go down too quickly, I usually go for a G size to accompany my hotdog and pay extra
The smallest A size bottles are just a joke
one mouthful and they are gone
I despise Sprite, love Faxe Kondi
Definitely not related
I enjoy the sugar free version of the Faxe Kondi
Almost nothing but glucose, just how I like it
Not similar at all, the Danish "sport drinks" are basically Sprite (carbonated and very sweet, not sure why they're called sport), so nothing like Oshee
No clue, we don't have that here
Faxe Kondi isn’t my favorite drink, but I like it okay
Faxe Kondi Booster on the other hand is the grossest invention ever
If this is true, I might just love you
I think Faxe kondi booster is something you have to drink enough of to enjoy
I wasn't a fan in the beginning either, but now I don't mind it
Every time I see cocio, it is labelled Pfandfrei with the German system instead of the Danish pant system
So I guess it is produced in Germany
I'm pretty sure that all Cocio is produced in Esbjerg, which is also the only location they mention on their website
I'm sure they are able to produce cans with other languages than Danish printed on them
Sure, but have you ever come across a cocio can (not the glass bottle) with Danish pant and not German
Cause I haven't.
I have to admit I don't really look at the text all that much, and I try to avoid the cans
After shaking a can it usually splutters a lot when opening, which the glass bottles doesn't.
But you are supposed shake the cans
I have never had that problem to be frank
I fucking hate it
You can "disable" it by changing your youtube to GB instead of your native language
In your options menu (where the My Channel, Switch Account, Sign Out buttons etc are) there's a Language menu, change it to English and it won't auto-translate anymore
I hate that you can't turn it off
I don't mind the possibility of it being there, as long as the user gets the option to turn it off at will
I've never seen that happen
All my stuff is still in English
I have not noticed it, even though I'm on youtube quite a lot
I agree it sounds really bad though
Yeah, if you actually watch things in other languages I can see that being a problem
I don't really watch non-English videos anyway so that hasn't affected me
In my experience even some young Germans will be very offended about any jokes about Nazi Germany and the Germans having been Nazis
For example, one (very nationalistic) girl basically threathend to have her dad "deal with me".
Another German guy was really chill, he joked with me about it and since heiling isn't illigal here, he had a couple goes at that too
I remember that I was told many times growing up to never ever joke about WW2 around Germans because they can't handle it
The few (mostly older) Germans I know do get angry at WW2 jokes, but do you know how true it still is, especially around younger Germans
It really depends
If it is devolped in English, it's usually better than the translated version, due to jokes being lost on translation, or just things sounding stupid
English any day
English definetly, some translations are just off and some sayings don't have a translation so it just sounds wrong
English also just sounds more natural for video games and TV shows since I'm used to it
English
Most games aren't translated into Danish anyway but even if they were I'd still choose English since it just makes it easier to talk about the games online, to play with other nationalities in multiplayer and to avoid potentially shitty translations
It's a bit of both good and bad stereotypes, I find (being a from a rural area but living in Copenhagen)
Men will often comment on how they find girls from the rural areas "cute" and how we are "so innocent and straight-forward", which I guess is not the worst stereotype to have thrust upon you, but it does get grating
On the flip side, the overall stereotype is that we are less progressive (which really depends on the city tbh), less educated, and more prone to violence
Couple that with a lot of ignorance on how the rural areas actually are, as many people from the capitol never go to the area of Denmark that's considered "rural", and you get an awful mix of a large group people actually believing the stereotypes and the rest helping upkeep it by constantly joking about it
I would say the divide is growing in Denmark
More and more ghettos of a certain type of immigrant appear,
And more and more hate towards those ghettos follow with it
Mostly Jutland Vs Sjælland, not so much rural vs urban
Except for Copenhagen, everyone hates people from Copenhagen
Same here
I’d say it’s mostly banter though
yep
jylland (largest part of denmark) and sjælland (island where Copenhagen is) have an ongoing feud, where they both hate (in a loving sort of way) each other, and would hate to be from the other area
Yes
Though Jutland in itself doesn't equal rural
Most people live in cities, far from what people would call "rural". People just assume we call live in rural areas for some reason
OP here
People in Copenhagen like to ignore the fact that they also have rural areas, and that Jylland also has cities
But, to be fair, having lived in Copenhagen for seven years now, I can comfortably say I've met more native Copenhageners who never set a foot on Jylland or Fyn (nor do they ever want to), than I have those who have been there
So, of course, they wouldn't have any idea what it is actually like :)
Snow
What’s that
In all honesty I haven’t seen these even when we occasionally get enough snow, but they look really lovely, so I’d be down for adopting the idea
We don't get snow often in Denmark, but my family has sometimes made ice lanterns
The lanterns usually only last a few days before they melt
No, our snow usually don't last more than a couple of days
I've never seen one in Denmark
I used to make them, when I was a kid
I guess it was the [Seest fireworks disaster] in Kolding in 2004
It had the equivalent of 284 tonnes explosives
Luckily only 1 died but that was only thanks to a quick response of evacuating over 2000 people
Many of those could easily have died
If we're talking most impactful, I would say the bombing of the Institut Jeanne d'Arc
The institute, also known as the French school, was a catholic girls school ages 3 to 14 in the middle of Copenhagen
During WW2 the resistance in Denmark cooperated with British forces in order to bomb something called Shell House, where many of the high-ranking nazis had their offices, as well as several resistance members, was kept
However, one of the bombers that flew over Copenhagen lost control, dropping its bombs too early (into an apartment building, killing 11 civilians) and afterward accidentally crashed into the area next to the girls-school
The smoke and fire by the school meant that the second wave of bombers thought the school was the target, so they bombed the school repeatedly after
The third wave did the same
86 children below the age of 12 were killed (many below 5 years old, as the school, was also a daycare for toddlers), as well as 40 adults (most of the nuns working at the school)
Furthermore, 900 people lost their homes and 304 were wounded (67 of which were children)
[Here's an article (in Danish) on the event, with pictures]
His goal wasn't even to kill people with the bomb in Oslo, his goal was to attract the police there so he could shoot even more on Utøya
Luckily, the fire kept going through the night
Imagine if it had all been lit at the same time
Rest in peace to the brave firefighter who passed
A true hero
Germany: Thank you for cheap border shopping and excellent humor
Sweden: You are there and youre Swedish doing what swedes do
Norway: Thank you for A-Ha and just being so friendly and awesomeF
dear sweden as long as you promise not to cross øresund if it freezes, i will promise you to totally not bonk you with a stick as is my legal right
Would be awesome to get to know estonians
thank you my friend
“Alcohol at 16
” Lol it isn’t enforced at all
A thirteen year old could buy it
This is heartwarming, tak svensker
This is beautiful thanks
Satans svensker, du fik mig til at grine
We have Harry Potter with Danish synchronisation
You take Danish class
Sweden is the annoying big brother all the Nordic countries love to hate and make jokes about
Maybe where you're from
I can assure you it's enforced in other places in the country
Don't let him fool you with kind words
If the winter had been just a bit colder, they would have walked across the ice like white walkers and burned down Copenhagen
I think they're talking about this
Where
Certainly not in Copenhagen
I mean in some stores but then you just go to the next one
Like 50% of the cashiers are 16 year olds themselves
When I went to efterskole faaaar out in the countryside in Sønderjylland it didn’t sound to me like it was enforced in more rural areas
I remember watching this as a kid because I was too young for the English version
Even then I knew it was shit
Tbf to the Danish Film Industry, we normally never dub our movies with RL actors, so they don't have much experience of it
Of course you're from Copenhagen
Every single time i see a Dane say something outrageous on this site, you turn out to be from Copenhagen
You really are a different country aren't you xD
I can assure you, they do enforce it elsewhere
Granted i haven't tried every shop in the country, but I did as a teenager try shops in Nordjylland and Sønderjylland
And have since as an adult seen teenagers get refused in Midtjylland and Fyn
They usually don’t ask for ID when the worker is young as well
Just make sure to get there in the evening when most of the adult employees have gone home
At least that’s how it was for me in eastern Jutland and western Jutland
I drink cream on it's own
I'm not representitive for my country in this particular scenario though, I'm way cooler and more right
I want milk in my coffee, but pure milk I won't touch
When I was a kid even the smell would make me gag
My brother, however, would basically drink 1 liter per day
I dont mind drinking milk, and i've had my fair share
but these days i avoid it
too many useless carbs
what's whole milk
whole wheat but with milk
oh, we call it "sweet milk" (3,5%)
in Denmark only children drink it directly
Lars Tyndskids Mark - Lars Diarrhea’s field
Lars being a common name
Diarrhea is not very common
The fictional country of Langbortistan
The name is originally from the Donald Duck cartoons, but has spread to be used in general for places far far away
I think the English name it was translated from was Faroffistan
In Danish we mostly say “bøhlandet” which roughly translates to “boogieland”. Or you could say “Lars tynd skids mark” which weirdly means “Lars(common first name) diarrheas field”
In Jutland, Denmark we say "Lars Tyndskids mark" which directly translated means "Lars (as in the name) Diarrhea's field".
In Jutland, we have quite a lot of fields, often a few kilometers away from any houses, and atleast like 20km from a little town
The "Diarrhea" is to picture a person who doesn't exist I think (the name being ridiculous and all), and being in a nonexistent person's field, you are quite far away from any form if civilisation
A common expression is "Hvor peperet gror", meaning "Where pepper grows".
(It is NOT prenounced how you think)
I think it refers to India, which as many of you know, is a fair jog from Denmark
Langt-bort-istan was something I heard a lot growing up, it translates to far-away-istan
Also Jylland / Lolland :^)
Where the crows turn back is also used here
Langt-bort-istan in danish
I think they used that a lot in the old Donald Duck comics, but no hyphens, just Langtbortistan
I know, I decided on the hyphens so that the translation would make a bit more sense
"Haha France surrendered"
At least it took them longer than four hours
Sweden for a lot of things, we're quite living in the shadow as they're twice the population and many times the size
I once saw a viral post about them getting government support money for studying in university
We do that too, only the amount we get is more than double
Sweden got the credit
Norway for the vikings, even though Norway was technically Danish territory back then
Vikings were still right here too
When traveling abroad, our language gets mistaken for Germans but especially Dutch
People with very little knowledge of countries and cultures see us as "basically the same" as Swedes
We're quite different though, even culture wise
Especially Norway and Sweden gets credit for the vikings
Vikings are as danish as it gets
Ragnar Lothbrok was from a danish folk tale not, like the show vikings show, norwegian
And through the Faroese, the Danes get a bunch of flack as well
WE get blamed for it more than you, because the Faroes are part of the Kingdom
Are you telling me Finnish men can match the levels of metrosexuality in stockholmian men
I am astounded
We lost a lot of land though
We could have joined the Allies before Germany invaded and allowed them to set up defenses in our country
And, you know, even if Denmark would have fallen eventually, just being able to hold out for a couple of weeks or even just some days would have bought the Norwegian Army and the Royal Navy time to mobilize, making an invasion of Norway impossible
This is my favorite example of it:
It's so DRAMATIC with the music haha
Lots of commenters there hate us with a passion, unfortunately the comments over the last few years of the video existing have changed in tone
It used to be a goldmine, so many people wishing death to Danes over it
You're right, gotta freshen up my history knowledge
True that, if it's any comfort we do recognize and discuss your politics as being ahead of ours
You do new things if it makes sense, we discuss it endlessly and nothing happens
There was also the question of which side Denmark would support if they had to, so Denmark was not really expected to fight the germans at all
Well, looks like an afternoon of Epic Rap Battles, mixed with a healthy dose of Dan Bull
Yes, we lost Iceland, damn traitors, and American imperialists
The cities are much older, and the first skyscraper you build will look really out of place
The city I come from, Aarhus, had for a long time exactly one skyscraper(-inspired) building
And oh boy does [This] look out of place
“Klar eller eg, nu kommer jeg”
“Klar eller ej, nu kommer jeg
Her kommer jeg
In Danish it fucking rhymes
“Klar eller ej, nu kommer jeg
We just say here I come
So that comes out to: nu kommer jeg
In Denmark it is “klar eller ej, her kommer jeg”
Jeg ved det, prøvede bare at få det til at ligne det rimede med jeg
They speak Danish in Greenland, the Faroe Islands and Iceland, but I don't think it's really the native language any of these places
I haven't noticed any difference in vocabulary anyway
In North Schleswig though, there is a variant of Danish which can be very hard to understand
It basically sounds like mumbled Danish
And there's plenty of words there that most regular Danes won't have any idea what means
So I'd appreciate them just turning to regular Danish
Excactly
For example, I would switch to the Norwegian or Swedish number systems when visiting these countries
All accents are equally modern
Just because they've changed less doesn't make them less modern
Yeah it is, and tbf I wouldn't expect a Norwegian to know what seksoghalvfjerdsenstyvende is
That's fair, just be careful with what you say, because calling a language "more modern" than another is a very easy way to look pretentious / elitist
I'm not an expert on the topic, but I think it might be a case very similar to standard Danish and Gøtudanskt
The other Nordic countries and their state run alcohol stores and high purchasing ages
In Denmark you can buy all liquor from regular grocery stores, weaker alcohol (less than 16,5% I think) at 16 and all at 18, and most stores don’t really bother to check ID
In eg
Sweden, you have to be 20 to buy it in special stores and they’re really strict about it
They’re as big alcoholics as us (maybe barren Iceland), but their states has put up some weird hurdles
2 things:
That's really interesting, and TIL, so thanks
A liqueur is a spirit drink with added flavours, e.g. orange (Cointreau) or cream (Bailey's) and often sweetened
Liquor is a  spirit drink which is generally a "plain" base, e.g. vodka or rum
They (at least Norway, I know less about Sweden) seems to have a crazy drinking and party culture just like us
It doesn’t seem to prevent anything
Depends on season a lot, sun is setting 21:40 in Denmark today
Google (bare google det) “just google it”for looking things up
Nuttela for hazlenut spread
Jep, "drage" for both
It's also the verb "to wander" ish
Yep, in Danish the word for both kite and dragon are drage
In Denmark "drage" is used for both kite and dragon
In Danish as well: "Drage"
It’s the exact same in Danish, as with so many other things
Walk in the bike lane
I once saw a kid in a cathedral stomp on the balls on a Jesus relief on the ground
Okay, maybe not outright not intelligent, but his (probably religious) parents were nearby
I met an American exchange student recently, and he was explaining how you pronounce danish words, and as a native Dane (he didn’t realize at first) I corrected him, but he told me I was wrong until I explained that I am in fact danish
I just gagged a bit
For their gondola, obviously
That's kinda like taking a selfie in front of the pyramids
Totally fine IMO
So you take Jesus, you carve him into a large stone or tablet, and you make sure to emphasize his
holy bits
And Austrian also invaded us some 79 years ago
Could definitely be the case here, for sure
Is deadpan common on your side of the pond, though
My impression is that, while sarcasm is common enough, deadpan delivery isn't. Genuinely curious
Not to mention that you guys had some pretty damn fierce resistance
There's not a word for it
But there is a general (though kinda lighthearted) animosity between us in Jutland and all of Zealand, especially Copenhagen
Same in Denmark
Provinsen is everything outside of the capital
In Denmark we also use the word ‘landet’ in the same sense and ‘udkandtsdanmark’ as a negative term, but it seems like people don’t agree on what area it specifies :p
Der er party i provinsen
Almost never happens due to the Danes' ability to spot other Danes from a mile away
And if they aren't Danes, they are most likely either Swedish or Norwegian
Ethnicity isn't the main giveaway
It's the way we behave in a public space combined with our "bland" style of clothing and similar haircuts
Well both my parents are Danish and I live here in Denmark, but my passport says I’m born in Singapore, so technically not originally from here
But If I’m speaking English I’ll always be aware that most Danish people understand it
I usually have the opposite problem with Germans, in that they always expect you to speak their language
Everyone is taught German for a minimum of 4 (or 6, they might have moved it) years, but it's almost universally hated as a subject here, and barely anyone actually speaks proficient German
This is the only danish comment, lol
Edit: found another
I dunno why, but you give me this urge to stuff you into a freezerbox and silence you for the world
Visiting Hamburg a decade ago, I was surprised how many lederhosen I saw
I was in Hong Kong in 25+ degrees and some people were wearing Timberlands and thick coats
I wore as little as I socially could get away with, I was so warm
Border regions are quite integrated with people living in one country and working in another such as the Greater Copenhagen metropolitan region:
In Denmark I’d say the norm is to travel to another European country 1-2 a year, with 4 not being uncommon
You need a passport (in case anybody will check you, which if you go by train or car, is not given), but I’ve only ever met one person without one
We also do trips to other countries at school
I live in Denmark
If you are like me and live nowhere near a border you might visit the cross border shops once or twice a year
In my circle, it's often seen as a small "roadtrip" done with friends and family for fun and such
However I have had friends who would visit a border shop on a daily or weekly basis whenever they ran dry of cigarettes or soda
Some also work on the other side of the border, though that is less common, I guess, but not unheard of
It's also pretty normal for some families to go to theme parks or water parks in other countries for a weekend or a small get-a-away
This was all before Corona though
I don't really know now
I used to live close to the German border (45 minutes) and we went there maybe 10 times a year mostly just to get cheap beer and candy ( had a friend who had 3 hours of in the middle of the day and then choose to make the trip to get beer and sodas for an upcoming party
I live in Copenhagen and meet a lot of Swedes who are working here and commuting everyday from Sweden
People drive to Germany to buy cheap beer, soda, candy etc on a regular basis
We take long weekends in Berlin, London, Amsterdam, Paris etc all the time
So yes, it is very common to go to another country
Every year, thousands of danes go to Germany to shop at the border because it's cheaper down there
We just drive right through the checkpoint without any problems
Never been asked to show passport
Most people who live somewhat close to the German border regularly goes to Germany to shop because everything is cheaper there
Usually, before Covid, you could just drive past the border without even realizing if it wasn't for the sign
So yes, very casual
We go to Germany a month or two before Christmas to get some goodies
Most of the time it lasts until summer of the next year
A few times I flew between two EU countries and no one ever checked my ID, just the boarding pass
It was strange every time to say the least
I've gone on 8 school trips abroad during my years in middle and high school
One year we went abroad 5 times, 1 trip to Germany and 4 to sweden
We've also travelled to the UK and Dublin
It's not that Europe is that densely populated, Australia is just the definition of sparsely populated
Just the Benelux area alone has a higher population than all of Australia, despite being less than a tenth the size of NSW
> Dunglish
That's an amazing word
We actually got a national ID a few years ago but it's still not valid for travels
Hokus-pokus-filiokus (which is used in other languages too) is from the Latin "hoc est corpus filii" which means "this is the body of the son". It was of course said in church at communion
The people did not understand Latin, but they did understand that something magical was taking place, turning bread into the body of Christ, so it was all a bunch of hokuspokusfiliokus
Our highschool (or one of them; there a schools for 16-19 year olds which focus on general education, business or trades
This is for general education) is called gymnasium
That is very confusing for everybody else, especially English speaking visitors
I was an exchange student in the US when I was 15, and told people, that when I returned to Denmark, I was going to gymnasium for three years
They just looked at me funny
We have the weirdest loan-word from German
A kitchen strainer for fx
spaghetti is called a "dørslag" which literally means "door-hit" and it utterly nonsense
It is a Danish way of saying "Durchslag" - which in German means something like "through-hit".
A long, thin bread in Danish is af flûte, which means flute in French
Only long, thin bread in French is baguette and not flûte
I love the word bankerot (bankrupt) which comes from the Italian banca rotta (broken bench)
At Forum Romanum bankiers had their benches where they conducted business
If a bankier couldn't fulfill his obligations, the bench was broken
Karentæne (quarantine) is from Italian quarantina or quaranta giorni , meaning 40 days
In Venice ships had to stay outside the habour for 40 days to protect the city from plague
My favourite one in Danish is "dram", which means a shot of snaps, comes from the Arabic "drachme" meaning a small quantity
Is that actually a Swedish "thing" though or is it simply like jokingly saying "De nada", "No problem", "No problemo", "kein problem" or whatever to someone who said thanks
You actually have "nemas problemas" in the Swedish language
According to the Danish dictionary it came to us (and probably you also) from Dutch slaap (sleep) rok (coat) so it seems the word took a detour through the Netherlands on it's way north
Doesn't surprise me it's (mostly) foreign though
I've always thought it sounded strange
How is toxic a Persian loanword
It comes from Greek
The old meaning of bonde is more "free-man" than farmer (although most free men were farmers)
I didn't know that
Yes, it's the magic words
True
And gymnós means naked
Well, it does come from the greek gymnós (meaning naked
) which was a place for sports, being with friends and have intellectual discussions
Nice
That would be dørkslag in Danish
We do, but it is not that common
It is more an old word for pour
Hælde is more used now
Wereas the Swedish fönster is probably from German Fenster, right
I think you're right
I was misremembering it
Thanks for the correction
By second language you mean a language that is unintelligible to natives
Then Danish
German is considered a "main foreign language" and about 47% of Danes speak at least low level German
In Denmark it's, for sure, german
We start learning it in school from about 4th grade (10/11 yo)
I’m not familiar with the younger generation in general, so the following is based on my sister
My sister is pretty good at browsing the net and such (and has been for a long time) but with a computer she is slightly less capable
So things like activating caps lock instead of shift
I don’t know about her abilities in file saving and such but I imagine they aren’t great since she’s used to google docs since that’s used in school
Not really that country specific, but god damn, teach the children Excel
It is the single most useful thing they are ever going to need in math class, since Excel is something you are most likely to actually be going to use in future jobs and studies
It was first when I got in the Danish equilavent of High School that they started teaching Excel
That should be taught a lot more in primary school as soon as computers becomes mandatory in class
Same in Denmark
Though when children get to the age where computers becomes mandatory for everything school related, they tend to get better at file management and other computer related tasks
That is not too bad, but it's funny
I know mild part compatibility and some different things regarding files, but mostly modding and playing games
as a 30 y/o who have smoked weed for the last 10 years, and everyday for the last 5 years, its everywhere, and people who dont think it is, just dosn't know
It's very rare for me to meet a person who haven't atleast smoked once, atleast for the younger generation ( I'm 18 ) I would say it's pretty popular
In christania you'll find people of all ages as well
That's honestly a good point
Although it does seem a bit weird to me at least, that while we in Denmark have a very
intense, drinking culture, we look at drugs like something unproductive jobless people partake in
Then again maybe the alcohol is the reason for the happiness levels
In Danish sometimes you can also leave out a d if it's there like Svend/Sven or Bendt/Bent
There's also:
Kamilla/Camilla
Fillip/Philip
Christian/Kristian
Nikolaj Kan also me be spelled ***4*** different ways with C/K and I/J resulting in Nikolai, Nikolaj, Nicolaj, or Nicolai
It's can truly be hell to write Danish (or Norwegian) names sometimes
Not a native, but people often mix up then and than (which do not sound similar in any way) and the ole they, their, there, they're
Overall it's fine
but as with any other place on the internet, people keep writing "then" when they mean "than"
and the other similar mistakes (their, they're, and so on)
Noted
Oh that is very much a native speaker issue
I went to Ireland to pursue a career in technology
What I found was an amazing international community where I got the best friends of my life
It was also a cultural eye opener for someone like me that never studied abroad
Regarding jobs I was super disappointed tbh
I came from an open and direct culture in Scandinavia where no one is worth more or less in a conversation
What I experienced in Ireland was a work culture that was founded in distrust to the employee and focus on hitting obscure KPIs instead of focusing on efficiency and value generation
So in essence I was so happy to get the personal development and the experience, but the professional experience and living conditions where horrible
90% of the international community I was there with have since left to other European countries or went home
Not exactly left left
But I am a Dane who has been working and living in the UK for some 9 years now
I like it here
I havent but my sister moved to sweden cause she dislikes our government
I think that's generally the case for Scandinavia
I worked for a couple of years helping expats integrate into Danish society, and more than once I've had to point out how weird it is that Danes don't really leave the country like is common in other countries
We'll go abroad for a year or a couple of years, but always with the intention of coming back
And tbh I think it boils down to how good we have it here
Unless you move because of romantic reasons or a job offer, or because you don't like how Scandinavia is, most of us see going abroad as an adventure, whereas in some other countries (I assume) it's something that's necessary
Same here
Denmark is fine but there’s so much of the world out there, I want to explore it all
I didn't say it wasn't :) it's one of the main reasons why I wrote 'some other countries'.
Mind you, I'd say well over half of the expats I dealt with was from UK, Germany, and France (mostly Germany, mind you), so people do move out from those countries
Just like they do move from Denmark and the other Scandinavian countries - it's simply for other reasons
Denmark; no, not really
We have some woods where you can be alone if you are lucky, but being a small country, it would be hard to live as a total hermits
There are stories though, of people living in the woods, but they will never be able to have full privacy
I don't mind the lack of it, although I do like to hike in big nature areas such as you would find in Norway or Sweden
Several of the northern rebellious provinces have vast areas of wilderness
But in the heartlands it's all planned and accounted for
So much so that what Danes call "nature" is what others would describe as industrial farming
We need to say "wild nature" to emphasise "nature not touched by humans".
That being said, the coasts are pretty need due to our policy of keeping them free of buildings and human activities
And if you go to the other parts of the Kingdom you suddenly have the Faroese Islands and Greenland
And that's [freaking] [amazing]
Nowhere in Europe has unspoilt wilderness
Swedes and Norwegians will point to Lappland, but Lappland itself is named after the Lapps/Sámi
They, though less populous, have certainly exerted a large influence upon the region
Lappland would look very different, and be home to many more species than it is today, had it been genuinely unspoilt
That said, I am of course being quite pedantic
Under that definition of "unspoilt", nowhere save Antarctica fits
If you include Greenland, we have tons of it
Like, a lot a lot
That being said, people tend to congregate where it's easy to get to and where everybody else is
I live near a lake/heath/wood area where there's a large parking lot right by the main road
There's always lots of people there, especially because the marked path is 2 km which is just the right length for old people and families with little kids
A few kilometers from there, you can drive down a long gravel road to reach a much smaller parking lot where the marked path is much longer (8 km)
I've been there lots of times and only met other people maybe twice
Absolutely love it
Last vacation I had in Scotland, my wife and I drove all the way from Inverness to Tongue and back the same day
The scenery is absolutely breathtaking and I can't wait to go back again
Don't miss the midges though, any chance of them being eradicated
That's true
I flew over Greenland once and it is amazing
The ice just goes on and on
You're not allowed in our club
Jk, we love you, Suomi
That is horrible news
You have my sympathies
Well, Denmark isn't on the Scandinavian Peninsula, but it is part of the geopolitical area named Scandinavia because of the cultural and linguistic similarities
It definitely wouldn't go down well in Denmark
never gonna happen, too many closet racists voting populist right wing parties
I don't think there is one
That's isn't to say we don't have newspapers who fill the role you describe - I can  think of several that do, as well as several politicians throughout history that have been brought down by those newspapers
But I don't think the politicians fear them
Why would they if they have done anything deserving of being brought down
Maybe Journalista
dk all though it’s not a real newspaper
Uncovers bad public spending
propably Norway
Norway is like the pseudo-twin to Denmark; exploring the west together while Sweden headed east
isolation and harsh conditions brought quite a few old scandinavians together
Probably Norway
Basically north sea empire and sruff 1000 years ago
Aren't you pretty good freinds with Austria
Our family used to enjoy visiting England together on "vacation"
I would say Norway as well, but I feel like there are tensions from Norwegians towards us Danes
Maybe because, we used to rule them, idk
Maybe some Norwegians can add some more insigths
Well, Scania is Danish anyway
Love me a good trip to the local English monestary
That's how Scandinavia works
As it allways has been whether you want it or not
Return of Skåne/Scania and Schlewswig-Holstein when
Oh my, I had no idea
Same here
Hviderusland
Moosefuckers
Nothing, friend
Very sarcastic (like everyone else's on this thread) and sometimes racist/sexist
It's like British but
yeah it's kinda just as dark as British
Ok thats good
The secret to Danish is beer
Most of the Swedes I have seen in Copenhagen seem to have discovered that
Well, not really a nerveous break down, but a break down of a sort
Danish prime minister breaks down laughing in government, while talking about buying circus elephants - one in particular, and her best friend
Subs in english
This is a long time ago, but Ditlev Gothard Monrad who was our Councilpresident (what we now call Stateminister or prime minister) in 1864 had quite the freakout
Long story short: He and his government were convinced we could win the war of 1864, despite how much the Prussians had kicked our asses back in the three-year-war, so they declared war on Slesvig-Holsten
I guess they thought they would have Russias support again, but because we were the agressors this time Russia understandably told us to piss off
Even our King Christian IX had tried to convince D G Monrad that it was a bad idea, but he wouldn't listen
So war was declared and it immediately looked bad
The Prussians were kicking our asses and moved closer and closer to Copenhagen
Christian IX ordered D G Monrad to declare that we surrendered but he refused, and eventually Monrad just started shouting (much like in Der Untergang) that the Danes would fight to the very last man
Every man, woman and child would fight in the streets and we would win
So the king fired him, like he should've done waay sooner
And appointed a new temporary government that made peace with the Germans
My first thought was Bertel Haarder, who was a minister at the time, who broke down in anger and swore at the journalist because he was interrupted while eating rice pudding to go on television and now didn't even have time to go to the theater
His tantrum was so bizarre that at least one person made a [techno remix]
Haha, good take on it :D
That rant was pretty epic
We’re just not good a confrontation
Probably that we hate the swedes and that Skåne is a part of Denmark
Although some people don't mean it as a joke, which just makes it funnier
Rasmus Paludan
By saying we hate Sweden, we also half make fun of those people
It's a reference to a law that is misunderstood
The common understanding is that we are allowed to hit people with sticks if the cross the frozen sea
Yes, I watch German news because it is important to me
Austrian because it is comedic in a fun way
Swedish because it is comedic in a sad way
I follow my own country’s (Denmark) politics very closely
I think we have a lot of interesting stuff going on at all times, so it’s a fun little side-hobby
The Faroe Island and Greenland are represented in the Danish parliament, so I feel it’s very relevant to follow their politics too
I check in on the rest of the Nordics from time to time, but don’t really go that much into depth there - Sweden, Norway, Finland, Iceland, Schleswig-Holstein
Germany too, just because I love Germany
I've been keeping an eye on Poland for a while because I'm lgbt and there's a lot of talk about queer rights over there at the moment
Yeah
Danish politics since 2014 have become Eastern European Populism tier sadly
Why not
Lol we hiked that mountain on a boarding school trip
Well, since there's no age requirement to drink alcohol here, it's literally impossible to do underage drinking
In my experience starting drinking at 14-15 is very common, although I haven't been that age in way too many years
I am 16 and can confirm
Drinking in Denmark usually starts around confirmation age, and gains frequency through the teenage years
Teenage drinking is basically an integral part of Danish culture
I can confirm this
Generally kids that young don't drink
My parents allowed me to have a tiny little taste when I was around that age but no more
Parents usually allow their kids to drink around the age of 14-15 and you can buy weaker alcohol (beer and such) from age 16
When you're 18 you can buy the harder stuff
It is (or at least it was when I was a kid and for my social circle, I can't speak for the entire country or different generations) common enough for parents to allow children 8-10 to have a taste of alcohol (beer or cider, not vodka and stuff), but in most cases you wouldn't be allowed to just take a beer and down it
Around 13 when you go through [confirmation] it's common to drink weaker alcohol like beer or ciders during the party to celebrate your ascension to adulthood, and at this point you are more likely to be allowed to have a beer or cider during events such as family gatherings
Then around 14-16 you get more and more freedom in regards to going to parties and stuff where drinking happens, especially when you go to high school (~16-19) considering they will have events with alcohol involved in my experience
When a 10 year old asks for a beer they'll usually get it, and their parents will smile when the kid inevitably realizes that beer had a.. peculiar taste that apparently is unpleasant for kids
Personally I started asking my kids is they wanted to share a beer with me when they were 12-13 years old, and when they reached partying age around 15 I sat down with them on a weekend and got them tipsy, just so they knew how it felt and what to look out for
Seems to have worked out fine since both of them seem to enjoy getting tipsy, but don't like being roaring drunk
There is nisse øl which for an American is a light beer and for Danes something you drink when you are 5 years old, so you could argue we drink as kids also
No it is illegal to sell alkohol to minors, but not illegal for private people to give alkohol to minors
I've had that happen on my friends while we were on a school trip to England once
They tried to purchase hard liquor, were asked for ID and provided it
Then they turned to their friends and said something, after which the cashier demanded *they* show ID as well, since they were with the people buying the alcohol
Then *those* people turned to *their* friends and commented how silly that was, after which those last friends were also asked to show ID
When it turned out they were under 18 (though the people actually buying the alcohol weren't), the cashier called the cops
That sounds absurd, but I know it happened
This was in Oxford
At the last election 14 parties were on the ballot, of which 10 was elected
We have two major parties who both are seen as being placed in the middle of the political spectrum but each point slightly towards left/right
However you have to hold a majority of the vote and therefore you have to get along with other parties to create a proper government
Currently we have a social democratic prime minister, with radical left(not what you think they are), SF and the red-green alliance as supporting parties
That’s a whole lot of parties
No there is a party whose name translated to radical right(sorry wrote it wrong) and they’re not really radical and they’re really not very right-minded
To be fair I think SF is slightly more radical than radical left but not by a lot lol
Are you talking about Radikale Venstre
That would be "the radical *left*" if translated directly but is called "the social liberal party" in English
Holy - i still mix up right and left like a child
(Gotta edit that one more time)
The 'Venstre' (left) in "Radikale Venstre" refers to the major center/right party "Venstre", and not left as in left wing- they are a centrist social liberal party
Venstre used to be in opposition to Højre (right) - now called the Conservative Peoples Party
These 2 parties (Venstre and Conservatives) are now allies, and traditionally the government-forming parties on the right wing
Dude I was just pointing out OP messed up translating the name
Yea maybe I replied to the wrong comment
I just wanted to clear up misconceptions for our readers
When I was poorer I was very good at shopping around for newspapers and magazines giving '1 month free' or 5 dollars for the first 5 issues offers
I could probably still do that I wouldn't be harmed one bit, but these days I'm actively paying for newspapers because I believe that is important to do
Long story short, I paid my friend half of the expenses for recovering a Jäger Meister someone took from him just because they didn't take my booze, which obviously wasn't his fault
I pay for the support for a political party, which also grants me a form of membership
Same here
Whenever they go on a donation drive I kinda think about how damn much I actually use Wikipedia, and throw them a few bucks
Most people have one first name and 1-2 lastnames
A generation back, most people had only one last name but today kids usually get both the father’s and the mother’s last name
Some have middle names but it is not common
Nicknames are rare and mostly used in very limited groups
Middle names are pretty common
It’s very few people I know that don’t have middle names
I believe you can have exactly one lastname
Unless the names are hyphenated to form just one name any other surname is considered a middle name (or firstname in systems that don’t use a middle name)
Really
Like a "firstname" middlename like Jacob, Thomas or Anne or a "lastname" middlename like Jensen, Holm or Winther
I can barely even recall a handful of people throughout my life that didn't have a middle name
There may have been more, but it feels like a very uncommon thing to me
And yes, usually simple first names serving as middle names, though they also tend to be somewhat obscure or even outright foreign
I assume it depends on location, only 1 guy in my class back when i was a kid had a middle name, but speaking with someone from Copenhagen he said basically everyone has one
If a current state admits it carries a responsibility then there could be made a legitimate demand for reparations
In 2017 it was the 100 year anniversary for the sale of the US Virgin Islands
And along that event was a bunch of Danish media attention to the Islands, which eventually prompted the Prime Minister to try to "reopen/renew" relations with the Islands
This was quickly followed by talks of reparations, some whining about their financial situation and random accusations of racism
Then ofcourse came the question of admitting guilt for slavery, following the talks of reparations
The government decided to deny any guilt and that was pretty much the end of that "renewed" relationship
No reparations were paid and the Islands have been paid no attention since, but they did put up a statue in Copenhagen to "honor" the slaves
Ofcourse all of this was a very minor issue for Denmark, as we could easily ignore the Virgin Islands forever, but with larger and more important countries it's a real dilemma if you should admit responsibility
For Germany it was worth it in the long run, but i doubt we'll see Belgium admitting anything for a while
Not until DR
Congo seriously presses the matter at least
I’m not too sure, but I think you might be right
Atleast I know that he hired some Danes and Swedes to “help out” down there
What does current royalty think about what their grandfathers did
They should close that monarchy in shame, along with the rest
Hmm still shame on them :)
I would still have crippling epilepsy and mental health issues so I would probably be “possessed by a demon” or some shit
My mom's family has been sailors for ages
So a gay sailor
Eat beets and cry a lot
I would have been deaf, and a widower dad since my wife would have died at childbirth
As for jobs, I'd probably work at a newspaper, since my dad was a journalist and later an editor
You are describing a Danish porn movie
Morally yes, practically
Not if we did it alone, but if the EU as a whole stood up to China, I think the results could be positive
Absolutely
Taiwan shows what China could have been, and that's why China hates them so much
Where does Santa Claus live
For example, in Denmark it's said that he lives in Greenland
Where does he live according to your tradition
Danish Santa Claus (literally called "the Christmas Man" lol), lives in Greenland
Greenland, though slot of people say the north pole
Everybody is saying either Lapland or Finland
Well
in Denmark it is commonly believed that he lives in Greenland
Don't worry, Denmark is also claiming the North Pole
We have "farm santas" in Denmark as well
We call them "nisser". I rember once feeding the one that lived on the loft of our barn
What do you call them in norwegian
What is the weirdest thing a tourist has mistakenly thought that you have/do in your country
I just saw a clip from "The Last Leg" where a person from New Zealand was insistent that mince on toast was a thing in Britain
Even though the Brits on the show repeatedly explained to him that it wasn't.
Have any of you experienced something like that
In the end of the semester, a chinese exchange student in my uni class said she thought it was so nice that people biking would wave to people across when approaching an intersection
When you slow down on a bike in Denmark it is customary to raise your hand besides your head to show bikers behind that you are slowing down
I can still imagine her waving to random people across the intersection when biking around town, thinking that they waved to her first
Edit: [Pic for anyone interested]
That we actually HATE Sweden
That we actually BEAT a cat in a barrel during Fastelavn
In Denmark many people use the [høvding] bike helmet which wraps around the neck like a collar
Someone posted on Reddit saying he visited Copenhagen with his father, and the dad thought they were because many people had hurt their neck
While on the subject of Chinese and foreign exchange students, we really should teach them a bit about Danish foods just to help them out
Once I was standing in line at my university's cantine and one of the dishes on the menu that day were tarteletter
A Chinese girl in front of me did not know the dish and put small frikadeller in the tartelet shell and the stuffing on the plate
I did not say anything as I did not want to embarrass her
Now you learned a fellow Danish person something new
I live in a small town in Jutland (I suppose you live/lived in one of the four biggest cities since there's a uni), and here the only custom is that you stretch out your left/right hand when turning left/right
I've never seen the cyclists here indicate that they're slowing down, but then again there's often not any cyclists right behind you
In the larger cities where bikes are everywhere, it makes sense you'd have such a signal
Ah yes, we all know that Italians must at the age of 13 demonstrate that they can identify 15 different types of wine, by taste alone
That's just sad
That means he's not just terribly ignorant about another country (which is excusable) but he's also terribly ignorant about his own
He made it all the way to a fancy restaurant without realizing his view of the country was wrong
I must say, quite a large amount of these stories seem to be about Americans
Well if we speak a bit slowly and enunciate, we definitely can :)
Most of these stories seem to be about americans
Now that's just sad
We also do that, but not with the hand next to your head
To say "thanks" in traffic we normally do a small nod or lifting one's hand slightly while looking at the person
On a bike I can just raise my hand flat towards them while looking at them, but this is different to holding one's hand high and next to one's head to signal you're stopping
:-)
I mean in the sense that we don't wish bad luck on Sweden and we don't want to beat up a Swede if we meet them in the streets
I can only wonder why he went to Finland in the first place, if that's what he thought it was like
It's not like North Korea is a tourist hot spot
That's simply because Danes generally understand Swedish better than Swedes do Danish
If you are asking in Swedish and they understand, they are likely going to reply in Danish
Every computer system ends up not working, and going over budget
Our tax authorities managed to lose track of roughly 100 billion DKK in tax revenue a while back
And in general our tax authority seems completely incompetent when it comes to implementing a functional IT system
The police in Denmark have been using mobile antenna data for years in court cases, to tell wether a person was located near a crime scene, as part of evidence
the data was full of errors in some cases, causing possibly innocent people to be convicted based on this
This was recently leaked in the press, and the police had known about the possible issue from a former employee who reported the issue back in 2013
he left afterwards, because they ignored him
Now multiple cases gotta go back in court
It's completely idiotic
[Great video on the subject here]
If you do not understand portuguese it is not nearly enough
Read about NotPetya
A huge cyber-invasion that took advantage of a certain vulnerable windows-protocol that only got fixed in the update leading up to the attack
The attack even hit patched computers by going through unpatched ones and shut down several companies as well as most government assets of Ukraine from what I remember
I mean, a cyber-invasion cost a total of 10 billion dollars of damages because of a hole in a windows protocol that then got fixed in the update afterwards
IT and tech is super important to keep up to date with in regards to security
I know, Mærsk was a company that took a huge hit (about 300 or 350 million dollars of damages) as the suggested security overhauls never went through because the people that had to do that didn't get a bonus
Hygge is apparently so difficult to translate, that the word has been adopted as an English word
*Døgn* as mentioned by others is missing in English, I think
A *døgn* is 24 hour (day and night)
Edit: Maybe you say 24-hour day
Not just English, it irritates me that most languages don’t have a gender-neutral and uncomplicated word for boyfriend/girlfriend
In Denmark, they’re your kæreste, no matter yours or your partner’s gender expression
It has no awkward double meaning (like how “girlfriend” can be awkward for a lesbian couple and in German the word for male friend and boyfriend is the same), and it doesn’t sound childish
English used to have a feature we still have in Danish and Swedish, which is the "negative" yes and no
Basically the difference is whether a question is positive or negative:
"Are you coming to the party
" is the positive form to which you'd reply "Ja" or "Nej", i.e."yes" or "no". This is the only form still in use in English
If the question starts off negative, you use the negative forms:
"Aren't you coming to the party
" -> To which you'd say "Jo" or "næ". In English this used to be "Aye" and "nay"
"Vemod" or to be "vemodig" is a curious Danish word that describes a sort of happy sad feeling
It's like very mild melancholy
It's what you feel when you finish high school or something
You're sad that you won't see your friends on the regular anymore, yet you're happy that you're sad about this - you had good times after all, and you wish the best for all of them
Or in autumn, you're sad about summer ending, yet also happy, knowing that spring will come again soon
Hygge
It's getring a little annoying to always say "cozy get-together with friends and family time"
“Hygge” ofc just noce cozy warm family stuff like that
Another one is more slang but still very versatile “spurgt” directly translated meaning “asked” its just a way of saying “who asked
Very nice to have when you just get unneeded or unwanted info
Yeah, for danish it is spelled “døgn”, but means the same thing
Would be great to have the equivalent in English
Denmark also has “døgn” same meaning, v cool
Kinda like the danish “overskueligt” which means easy to look over, as it’s easy to understand or do
The fact that English doesn’t have that is just really træls
Also, I've yet to find a perfect translation for "ærger" (jeg ærger mig)
Døgn is indeed a useful word as it doesn't relate to time of day or the date at all
If there's some military exercise that's been going for 72 hours, that'd be three "døgn" no matter what time or date they started and finished
And since we also have "dag" (day) it isn't as ambiguous as "Day" in English
Even better is Danish "forgårs", basically like saying 'fore-yesterday" in English
Because "the day before yesterday" is just a linguistical atrocity
Yeah, we have "menneske" which is the same as "Mensch". It is used fairly often as well
I guess "human" is the word that comes to closest
English has adopted the Danish word *hygge* now
“Flabet” is also good, meaning annoying/flippant attitude
Don't you just say 24-hour day
English was just being træls for a long while
That's Jutlandish, not Danish
It's *ærgrer* but yes the closest English words would be irritates or unsatified
If you talk about how many cars cross a bridge in a day, it's contextually implied that's both the day and following night
Or if "this" happened in a day
An (police) rapport for the previous night and day would be a *døgnrapport*. Could you say a midnight rapport to imply it's from midnight to midnight
Funnily that (as far as I can tell) is pronounced exactly the same as the Danish word for he
That could also be your wife/husband
But how much do people really use that
It just feels awkward to me but I’m not a native speaker so disregard me completely
We don’t have any gendered terms so the gender-neutral term is the standard one
We do use farfar, farmor, mormor and morfar
Yeah but it’s a super over-commercialized version
I saw an article that called hygge “a fantasy that could never come true” because apparently you need Georg Jensen China and organic hot chocolate brewed by virgins and cashmere wool socks to even begin to THINK you’re having a hyggelig time
You can hygge with cup noodles in your small messy student apartment, the fuck
Let's chill and watch a chilly movie in a chilly place
That will be a lot of chill
I think you're right, I got that mixed up
Is "nä" not a thing in Swedish
Both words are very similar and mean exactly the same in Danish
Here's some Danish and German added:
"Du hörte *väl* om statsministern
"Du hørte *vel* om statsministeren
"You *did* hear about the prime minister
"Du hast *wohl* über den Premierminister gehört
(German) (perhaps more *ja wohl*)
"Tyvärr, jeg har *ju* en tenta"
"Desværre, jeg har *jo* en eksamen"
"Sorry, I *do* have an exam"
"Tut mir leid, ich habe *ja* eine Prüfung"
"Han är *ju* en idiot"
"Han er *jo* en idiot"
"Well, he *is* an idiot" (doesn't work as well)
"Er ist *ja* ein Idiot"
A lot of the meaning depends on your emphasis and intonation
German could also use *doch* a lot
Oh yeah you are right
It's ærgre though
I don't know why my phone didn't correct that . That being said I feel like irritated and unsatisfied doesn't really fit
And it’s very common to never get married so someone could’ve been together for 15 years and still kærester
I’ve known of a married couple who still call each other kæreste (means dearest) because it’s just way cuter than wife/husband
How about *ja* or *wohl*? Here are [a few examples] from a non-native German speaker
Yes, it's a bit different in Danish as a day means a day
So when we talk about what happened in the day and night, we say - this happened in a døgn
But in English it would then be alright to say - this happened in a day - and people will not mistake it for during the day
No not as such
We do have "den" which is either gender but it's often seen as rude to use about people
It's rather quite common make fun of the Swedes for hen
Oh no, not at all
I just wondered how widespread it is
Like in Danish we have the word partner too but no one uses it
Morfar/mormor and farfar/farmor are both bedstefar/bedstemor
They are bedsteforældre
So it depends, how specific you need to be
They exist but no one uses it
Farmor doesn’t have an awkward double meaning
Which is what bothers me about girlfriend and “Freund/Freundin” (literally just friend and female friend)
Plus kæreste means dearest
Too cute
No that's really wrong, bedstemor and bedstefar is definitely also in widespread use
I think it might be more common in Jutland though
Feel free to review my non-native examples linked above :)
It's seen as Sweden being overly PC / Swedes being SJWs
I think in your examples we'd use "den" but I'm not 100% sure
Either that we'd just say "the person" instead of using a pronoun
Similar to English you can say he, if you don't know the gender
Fair enough, I’m in Copenhagen and I never hear it
But we can all agree that farmor and farfar is used too
Definitely
It's all mixed up in my family, we call farmor, farfar and morfar just that, but mormor we call bedstemor for some reason
Thanks
Also, what do you think about "Du hast *ja doch* über den Präsidenten *wohl* gehört, oder
" I'm just trying to play with compositions
[Østerport II] has been awarded the architecture monstrosity award in Copenhagen by referendum
[BLOX] is also a contender
Especially considering the location on harbor front amongst older buildings
Or [boring office buildings] also close the harbor front
Rebæk Søpark (think that's what it's called) is the ugliest building in the country IMO
[Looks like something straight out of the eastern bloc
It's a residential building, not a hospital or anything, which would at least have made it's looks slightly more justified
Great contenders
BLOX for me is really one of the ugliest things in the city
I might be partial since I have to look at this eye-sore every day, but my first thought was [Carlsberg Metropol] I take very specific joy in the fact that it's falling apart
Kalvebod Brygge for me, prime real estate on the sea front completely wasted on buildings that look like they should be in Høje Taastrup
I get almost angry every time I'm there (also the worst stretch of the Copenhagen Half Marathon)
[The Central Bank] is famous for being loved or hated
[please don't link directly to Google]
We do have ghetto areas like [this] but I think [new buildings] are the worst
They are just [squares] with no details and creates no nice atmosphere around them
> sorta modern
Never understood this
Modernism as a style is at this point pretty darn old, and looks much the same now as it did before
It's not like modern *has* to mean ugly, it's an odd allowance we give these buildings for no reason
100 years ago, many of those other buildings everyone likes were modern
Today, being abstractly "modern" is all they have going for them
I don't love it, but I don't hate either as it doesn't stick out so much at least
Honestly the American embassy in Copenhagen fits that description, its a block of concrete, no detail, nothing
Most other embassies are in old buildings with charm and details and colour
There is so much shitty stuff around østerport now and it sucks
Yes, of course they do
Not just christianity though, also islam, buddhism etc
I don't see why anyone would want schools not to teach it
Yes
Lots of cultures are based on the religion of that area
In order to understand many of today's international problems and conflicts you need to understand the culture and cause
Hence knowledge about religion is important
What is not important is preaching religion in school - that should be avoided
Yes, it's a private school but not religion based
I'm atheist myself and it annoys the heck out of me
But I can't change it
;-;
Yes, I'm currently in Gymnasium (Danish high school) where we have an obligatory class called Religion on the second year
Though in elementary school it was obligatory to have a class called Kristendom (christianity)
I think some schools have changed the subject to religion instead of only christianity
Yes
It's pretty unbiased and teaches us about all the major religions of the world
The reason: it's something that most people in the world believe in, so it's important for our "dannelse". (not sure what the english translation would be, "shaping us into productive members of society" i guess)
It's compulsory, and so is Ancient Studies, where we learn about ancient statues, epics, poems, etc
Mostly ancient Greece though
Again, it's also a part of the dannelse
I do feel that it’s quite silly that it is a subject that you can have for exams though
I wasn't actually aware you could that
Pretty sure, never went to one though
Tell him that some places we still need to ride horses since we don't have cars, and that electricity is only normal in the bigger cities
Tell him only rich people have microwaves
Well thank you
Hell yeah
Aarhus
Copenhagen is sitting on the edge of our country, so people in Jutland often feels distant to the government
I might be biased as I live here, but I would consider moving the capital to Odense
The reason being its central position
Oh so *that* would destabilize Belgium
Wouldn't Odense make more sense then
Or perhaps Kolding
> Copenhagen is sitting on the edge of our country,
Well that can be mended
The Swedes don't even want Skåne anymore
I would go for Odense only because it’s sits perfectly in the middle
It would also make Fyn more than a speed bump lol
Move it back to Roskilde
Ribe, the oldest still existing town in the country
It's kinda funny
It seems to me that every time British person mention any settlement in the UK larger than 3 houses it's always done with great derision
Do all of you hate everywhere in your country
I don't get it
Amsterdam is already the capital of the Netherlands
Yeah, Copenhagen was once really central, but then we lost Skånelandene to the swedes in the 1600s.
Randers is perhaps the last resort
Any
Other
City
Come on, it doesn't make sense to have the capital in a motorway rest stop
Funny thing is that I’ve only heard Jutland mentioned as “the mainland” in jokes
We do have a lot of jokes about each other
In Copenhagen Jutlanders are called substitute Germans and Zealand is the Devils island in Jutland
Copenhagen was made capital when southern Sweden was part of Denmark, back the Copenhagen would have been close to the center
Oh we do
I think it is just a much a rural/uban divide as a regional divide tho
No, back to Jelling
I agree
Imagine if Randers ruled the nation
It's the capital of the scooter
Næstved it is
So by your logic H.C. Andersen was a product of motorway toilet sex
Would you say that the brits ruined Britain
I mean not really, yeah their dialect is maybe easier to understand, but I also think it depends on who you ask, fx
I am from Jutland so I probably feel less connected to them, compared to someone from Bornholm would
But before the Swedes conquered Skånelandene they were danish, but were assimilated
The city of Lund used to be a important Danish city
Randers might have a bad rep, but it isn't really founded on any sort of truth
It's one of the cities with the best level of integration, lowest level of crimes per capita, and most diversity when it comes to income
It also doesn't have any ghettos and has one of the highest engagement from citizens in their local government
So yeah, imagine if Randers ruled the nation
Well no
Of course not that'd be silly
He'd be the product of side-of-the-dirt-road bush (i.e. the closest thing to a motorway toilet back then) sex
They didn't have motorways in the early 19th century
Or maybe he'd be the product of stagecoach sex
I'm pretty sure they had the room for it
As a Dane, I have no idea what you mean that we think people from there are harder to understand
It's very much the most intelligible dialect for me
I’ve lived there
It’s ok, but some of the stereotypes were also thoroughly confirmed
Not all though, and I think it’s definitely made a huge transformation in recent years
I've lived the first 22 years of my life in Randers and I have no clue what you are on about
Stereotypes can be confirmed for anywhere - I've lived in Copenhagen for 7 years now and have seen a lot of stereotypes confirmed a lot of times
If you look for them, you can always find them
I've lived in Randers for 21 years and never found any of the stereotypes be confirmed any more than I have in other towns - that is to say that some individuals confirm them, and some don't. It depends on where you look
Randers is a city with over 96500 people, obliviously not all of them are going to be uneducated, violent criminals and all wear adidas and listen to techno - and it's unreasonable to assume so
Especially when the numbers speak for themselves
Ah, Niels Ebbesens huset - no it's not a pub, just a regular restuarant formerly called "Niels Ebbesens" after the guy that we have a statue of in the city center (now called Potten og Panden, I believe)
The window open because during the German occupation of the 1340s the main German leader Grev Gert had stationed himself in Randers with all of his men
A bunch of local farmers and knights banned together to try and oust the Germans and the hero Niels Ebbesen killed Grev Gert in his sleep, during a heist to try and take back the city
Local legend is that the building he was killed in was placed where Niels Ebbesenshuset is now, and the room where he was killed is the one the window is open in
Story goes that if you close the window, Grev Gert will burn down the city in anger, since his spirit will be trapped and unable to go to heaven
That part isn't true, of course, but the rest is pretty spot on
I think we’re a bit important, in terms of being very frugal, and with our very developed wind and pharmaceutical sectors
Also, fuck Danske Bank
You create great basketball players, which get noticed
And great people - all slovenians I have met have been amazing
That, but also a lot of tech stuff
Both talent going to the rest of EU, and tech conferences in Portugal
If you guys continue that stuff you’ll be very important going forward
Also, leather
Everyone I know who works in leather says you guys are the best
A lot of companies in the Nordic countries are setting up shop in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, because of your good, well educated and cheap workers
Also, for some reason, a lot of the accounting I’ve had to deal with from danish companies has been outsourced to Estonia
I guess because it’s a lot cheaper, and probably just as good
Every time I visit I see more and more Nordic and international company buildings
So you can’t be that unimportant
We do send the worst trash from my country to Spain every year
Must suck to have to deal with those assholes
On the other hand, you guys need to develop your economy away from tourism, that shits not the same anymore - especially post COVID
We're just clillin' up here on top of Germany
Trying to be the teacher's pet
Occasionally throwing a Margrethe Vestager into the mix

Oh for fucks sake
I think the Irish tax policy is by far the largest impact on the EU ️
Yes
Ecco has a big presence there, to name one ️
The Faeroe Islands too, while Greenland is a part of the OCTs
Like everyone else, I'd say the biggest downside is the wait time, especially with specialist, but they are often very good at trying to be flexible for you, if you ask nicely and they think it's urgent enough
I had some issues with some persistent pain in my uterus and wanted to book an appointment with a gynecologist, but was told they had a 9 week waiting list
At this point I was pretty sure it was something serious, so I asked the receptionist if they had anything else, no matter what time of day I didn't care, which they sadly didn't. However, two days later they got a cancellation, and she called me and told me they could fit me in the day after
So it is possible to move ahead, if they suspect it's serious enough
Also, luckily the Danish government is also willing to foot the bill for operations done at private hospitals, if the waiting list at public hospitals are too long
I got my tonsils removed at a private clinic, where the government paid for everything, since I would have had to wait for ages if I didn't go private
The most cited one is wait lists, but we have to remember that this also applies in the US, difference is there it's the rich who get short wait times and the poor who go completly without
Rather upper middle class-upper class people have slightly longer wait times and give everyone else the chance to get all the healthcare they require
>	Well single payer systems are not really free
You pay for it with taxes
I absolutely hate when people say this
If the word "free" is to have any kind of reasonable meaning, you can't bend it like this
Someone, somewhere *always* pay for something
Is it free to use the roads
No, they were paid for by taxes
Is the Christmas present I got free
No, the giver paid for it
Is it free to call the police and report a crime
Nooo
You paid for it in taxes
Is a walk in nature free
No no
Someone owns the land and has a cost associated with it
Saying free healthcare isn't free is completely arbitrary, and has no place in a rational discussion
In Denmark we have to call lægevagten (loosely translates to doctor on duty) and a doctor or other trained person will determine if you can come to the emergency room
This has have good results
Of course there is still waiting time and sometimes many people but not that many who shouldn't be there
I think most people would consider chest pains an emergency no matter what
In Denmark, stuff like getting a gastric bypass (just the first weird example that came to mind) in public healthcare would take a looong time, a lot of evaluation etc
but in private healthcare, they would basically just do it
The most common type of private healthcare to use are psychologists and psychiatrists
Mental healthcare is unfortunately pretty underfunded so waiting times are often looooong
As in months
>	The gift is free because I put approximately $0 towards that present
A pedantic economist would argue that it isn't free, because it comes with an expectation of reciprocity
>	and I didn't pay to go on the walk either
If its public land you paid for it as much as you paid for the road
>	This isn't a difficult concept
I agree
It's just people like you that wants to make it much more difficult than it actually is
You don't need to explain your position
I understand it perfectly
My problem with it, is that it is arbitrarily applied to healthcare, and that it basically means that the word 'free' no longer has meaning
Lol
You think you overpay for healthcare, but at the same time you believe "free samples" are actually free
You are a riot
Your "free samples" are paid for by the slight increase in price on the product that is earmarked for marketing
The point still stands; You have a completely arbitrary line of what *you* consider free and you can argue either way on each and every example
For instance, most people would say that it is free to drive on public (non-toll) roads
Only a small, particulary pedantic subset of people would claim that it isn't. But for some reason, that subset it bigger when the discussion relates to healthcare
However, when you start with the "hurr durr free healthcare isn't free" in a discussion, you are derailing what we are talking about - the rest of us understand the context
Just like *I* understand that in the context of "Free samples", the samples are *actually* paid for by the consumer
I noticed you didn't comment on how people arbitrarily claim free healthcare isn't free, but free road usage is
>	No I explicitly said people pay for roads
You didn't. Perhaps you think you did, but then it wouldn't be hard to find it, would it
>55 would be "half of the way to three (starting from two) times twenty and five". (2
5\*20+5)
Five and 2½ times twenty (femoghalvtredsindstyve)
You also have *halvannan* in Swedish
Edit:
So it's five plus one-half less than three times twenty
Yeah, if you wanna learn it, you really just need to remember it like you would remember the names of anything else
We’re never told to even try to make sense of it, just memorize it
WE’RE TALKING ABOUT LANGUAGE NOT NUMERALS YOU SVENSKJÄVLAR ;,( wtf
As a Dane learning french in school, I found it almost as weird as the counting system from my own country
Nynorsk - as a Dane
But Norwegian is a cute language
Like puppies
Norway used to have similar numbers
Some places in Norway still say ones before tens
Is it half-trice or half third
Here you can hear the numbers
Yeah, it's the same origin IIRC (from halvsjette, 5½)
40 is also funny in Danish, because the long form is spelled *fyrretyve* (four twenty), but it actually means four tens (like in Swedish and English)
It comes from the Old Norse *fjórir tigir*
Twenty is metric, so sorry guys you are still in the dog house
Actually twenty also means two tens, so it's not that different
You just learn the words
60 = tres
80 = firs
We just never changed the old system
Do you know the Swedish system before femti, sexti, sjuti etc
Really not that hard, no “advanced memorization training” is required
Two milliard three hundred five and half sixty million nine hundred four and half fourty thousand six hundred nine and fours
The only weird numbers are 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 and they’re just part of the vocabulary
After 100 it just becomes the same
>Sooo how do you say 755 278
syv hundred femoghalvtreds tusind to hundred otteoghalvfjerds
> zwakkeling
Svækling in Danish
Stop stealing our words
He did use half trice in your video
Instead of saying half trice (halvtredje), you could also say one-half less than three
The Finnish Civil War
I know it happened, and i think Mannerheim was important during the war
Honestly the first time i heard about it I was genuinely surprised, firstly that Finland had a civil war and secondly - as someone who knows a lot of history - that I knew nothing of it
I know surprisingly little about my owns countrys history, compared to what I know about pretty much the rest of Europe
Seeing that you mention Ireland, and the fact that you mention the football games against Denmark, I'm assuming you are Irish
I'm Danish, for the record
Yeah, terribly sorry about that, I can imagine it was quite humiliating
Hey, I can't help the fact that we were drawn against each other so many times in a row
Some bookies probably lost quite a bit of money on our draws, that was the most frequent result after all
The 1st of may, labour day
You hang out in a park, drink lots with friends, listen to political speeches, boo at certain politicians, cheer for others, participate in demonstrations in the streets and most importantly, drink yet even more
thats because your entire country has been celebrating my birthday a day late, this entire time
24th in the evening,then 25 or 26 there's a big lunch party thingy
Not by how they look, but i swear i can identify a danish accent (when speaking english) atleast 10km away
Honestly, that woman I would have assumed was Danish - in fact, she looks a lot like [I do] especially when it comes to [facial features]
Woooooow, that guy is spot on
Swedes are the ones with the mullet (actually called Swede-hair in Denmark)
We have a great saying for things, that won't fit: "Well, this fits about as good as the hair on a Swede".
Jack wolfskin is definately how i recoqnize Germans
No no no, swedish is danish but written and pronounced like if it was english
However what i meant was that when danes speak english they pronounce word in a way that only danes pronunce english, while it can be similar to other accents it just somehow screams “danish” to me
Im not dutch in any shape or form, so that's probably why
It’s an 80s thing, but somehow the jokes stuck
Ok svensker
When we are not calling it Swede-hair, it is referred to as Bundesliga-hair
Copenhagen were some sommers it's impossible to even walk on the streets in some areas,
Then there Skagen but that is mostly internal tourist from the rich areas of Copenhagen and is mostly happening in one week
Bornholm Is also quite the tourist hotspot since its the only place in Denmark with cliffs and its also the sunniest place in Denmark, but still the only people coming there are Germans and Danes
The little mermaid in Copenhagen
Like calm down it’s just a freaking statue
Edit: And Nyhavn
Can’t forget that
Copenhagen, and also the west coast is filled with Germans right now
Rådhuspladsen (townhall) most of copenhagen
Tell me if i missed something
Copenhagen is by far the most touristy area in Denmark, besides that, maybe the beaches (we got a lot of those)
Central Copenhagen, so many peolpe going to tivoli, the H C Andersen statue ect
Copenhagen
All these tourists, especially Americans will be like "yeah I visited Denmark it was really nice" and whn yoi ask them whoch places they visited they will just go "all around Copenhagen". As a Jutlander I cringe every time I hear about Americans visiting Denmark
Because they never visit 'Denmark'. They just visit 1 city and are amazed by people on bikes
>Copenhagen
I feel like Nyhavn is in every Instagram ever
Don´t forget the western coast of Jutland where Danes, Germans and Norwegians vacate in droves
Its e beautiful part of the country but the tourist infrastructure isn't always pretty
Nah, Denmark and the nature here can be lovely
Depends what you want
There are no mountains, but we have a unique coastline, and areas around Silkeborg and Rebild respectively are very pretty
Expensive yes, but boring its not
Depends on what kind of tourist you are if all you wanna do is lie down on the beach in 30 degrees Celsius then Denmark is definitely not the place for you since we tend to have quite shitty weather
I know some of them, but not all
Then again, I know some of the German states or UK counties as well  it isn't something we are taught, as we don't have much use for knowing them, just like you, in the US, don't have much use for knowing the Danish kommuner or German bundesstaat
Like it's good to be aware of them and know the big ones, but the rest you can research if you need
Most US i would probably recognise when I heard then though, so there would be no need to clarify
But, tbh, people probably already knew you were from the US the moment you spoke, just like they would for any other English-speaking country
What throws me every time is the abbreviations
Sure some of them I can guess me way through, but in general it annoys me when people from the US uses them in international groups and then get mad if you ask for clarification
But that's a whole other ballpark
I think a lot of people could name at least the important ones (Texas, California, New York, Florida and following the 2020 election maybe Nevada and Georgia as well)
I think I know all the states by name(nevermind 34), but I have a hard time finding then on a map expect for the famous ones, Midwest and the north/south states
I know a few, including Minnesota, but still find it annoying as fuck when Americans assume I know various things about their federal states and their inane abbreviations
I don't know what Minnesota's abbreviation is, or what minutes details you pretend makes it different from the rest and I don't really care to
Please don't introduce yourself as being from a specific federal state before the country though
If I cared what street you grew up on I'd ask
I think most have heard of basically all the states particulalry the ones by the east and west coast
Now if you would ask them to name the cities or point them out on a map i think many would have a hard time particularly with all those rectangular states in the middle
I recently took one of those geography tests
To compare I got 92% with Europe getting a mistake in Balkan
All of South America  correct, but only able to place 50% of the US states correctly
We know the names of the states and their approximately  location but the midwest and North east can be quite hard to perfectly pinpoint
Capitals are only really known in the biggest states
One of my friends posted this quiz on Facebook
It about naming all the states in 10 minutes or less
It took me a few tries (or around 40), but ultimately I got it
I have a feeling many would just assume it's American, so if you said I'm from Victoria, Ontario or  Queensland, they'd know it's not in the UK, so
USA, maybe
Outside their cars, I don't really see German write DE everywhere
It certainly isn't like in the US where the abbreviations will be an answer to when asked where they are from
Literally today I was in an international group someone answered "PA", no other context at all, to a question about where people are from
And then got annoyed with people when they asked what he meant, or whether he was from Panama
That's the sort of issue what I was referring to
I run into it almost weekly
I mean, I'm just lazy, the only language I *tried* to learn was Dutch, but as I said, I'm lazy, so I just stopped ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
This, all of this

One being Canada, and the other being South Korea
I am not the biggest fan of the EU

That WIFI and cellular is bad for you - which is also why there’s some pushback when it comes to 5G.

My mom gets so offended when I refuse her homeopathic bullcrap
According to her I should respect it, at least for the placebo effect
But I think it’s borderline dangerous to rely on these things
When you try some bullshit water and sugar pills for a few weeks instead of going to the doctor, you might actually make it worse
She also keeps sending me articles about how dangerous my actual meds are
One was about ibuprofen
What kills me is that, honestly, it's the rational thing to do in that situation, right
Sheesh
Sorry, I know I'm late to the party
I had this tab open in my browser for a while
I pretty much never uses it because it's terrible
The English language one I use *all the time*.
I will literally use the English wikipedia for Danish things sometimes because the Danish one really sucks
The danish one really is quite for almost all bigger things, and even for a lot of small things
I’ll always start off on danish wikipedia to get a sense of the topic and such, and if i need more info i’ll switch to english
Starting in danish makes it a lot easier for me to grasp what the article is about, especially if it uses concepts and names which i’m usually more familiar with in danish
Honestly, I use the Danish wiki most of the time
I only switch over to the English wiki if it is a little more obscure subject
I prefer the English one, English has kind of become my "online" language, I prefer it over Danish whenever I am online
Sometimes I feel like the English wiki offer more information, I do use the Danish on occasion when I am reading about something very specifically Danish
I use it depending on the article as for most subjects they provide a comment on how whatever it was affected Denmark
Though most articles are just plain more informative in English
I only ever use the Danish Wikipedia if the subject is Danish
The Danish Wikipedia has few articles, which isn't great, but what's worse is how lacking the ones that are there are
What's even the point of reading the three sentence article, when I'm going to have to go to the English article afterwards
I thought that was kinda weird, until I realised I have done the same with reading an article in bokmål if there weren't a Danish one
Drinking tap water is perfectly normal
Drinking bottled water is seen as bad for the environment and a waste of money
In some supermarkets you can buy an empty bottle and fill it from a tap, also in the supermarket: [Example]
Totally normal here, but the tap water from Copenhagen are a lot harder so some people would buy bottled water and store it, but only if it's on sale at your local Rema1000
So it's more of an option the anything
Yes
Our toilet water is so clean that you can drink it
Yes very normal here in Denmark and it is delicious
But more and more water wells have the past years been tested positive for pesticides and E. coli bacteria
So it's probably something we have to get used to in the future
:-/
Sparkling water tastes like TV Static

Never heard of it

no clothes' gonna help ya
I really like the cold, I love snow, I am going to miss it since it kinda seems like inevitable and it makes me so sad that even though I try myself so hard even by donating money to causes and keep recycling and telling everyone I know about it being a serious thing now, things only will get worse
We are
Isn’t that only the Czech Republic
It's literally a problem for immigrants in the Scandinavian countries, that natives won't let them try and speak Danish/Swedish/Norwegian to them - it's part of the reason why a large amount of our expats never bother to learn our languages
Why bother when natives won't let you use it anyway
The moment you try in the native, they'll simply reply in English
I'm a teacher in Danish as a foreign language for expats, and I have students who are extremely good at Danish, and can basically have full on conversations lasting hours, yet have an accent so Danes will simply reply to them in English no matter what
It's such a huge problem that it's even part of our official teaching material - included in small texts they read, or lessons dedicated to learning how to ask Danish people to please speak to them in Danish
I'm aware they face the same issues in Sweden and Norway, according to the teacher of our company's branches there
I had a student who one day came and asked me if he was someone was saying "a coffee, please" wrong, since baristas would always reply to him in English after he said it
His Danish was perfect and that's an extremely simple sentence to say, but he had an accent so people would never allow him to use it
It's certainly-- challenging
Learning to read it is easy enough, learning to speak it is a whole other ball game
The first challenge of my lessons will always be getting my students to pronounce my name correctly (especially because they'll have seen it written on their schedule before starting, so most will assume it's pronounce like most languages would)
Honestly none, but it makes sense as I'm a huge geography nerd when it comes to anything on a map, but the Romanian cities aren't the only one I would have a little trouble pointing out their exact location within their borders
Same for me, I thought I'd make it further down the list, but I've honestly never heard of Zaragoza
Whenever I see a German city name I dont recognise I just assume it's part of the [Ruhr area]
Really
Torino
It's just the English name for it
Juventus FC and Torino FC are both football clubs from there, and I would guess that even non-football-fanatics have heard of Juventus at least
For some words with difficult pronunciations like "brød", it helps to pretend you are puking
At least that is what the exchange students here do
Unless you're from Sweden or Norway, perhaps Germany or France, don't expect to ever sound Danish, maybe your grandkids will accomplish that
Learn the basics of H, D, I and ÆØÅ
Verbs *always* end with an "r" in present tense if they end with an "e" in infinitive - the so-called "nutids-r". Even if you cannot hear the r when you say the word out loud (which is the case with verbs such as "høre - hører" and "lære - lærer"), you still need to add it
If you get your nutids-rs right, you'll have learned something that the majority of native speakers haven't managed to learn
Even Danes have it tough with genders
We don’t use genders at all
Also be prepared to let the r be a growl and to stick your tongue out for the d in brød. Brød is horrible word for foreigners
I've found that my mates from france have had a really easy time learning the pronounciation of the words
My mate who came here this last summer could say "rødgrød med fløde" after 5 minutes
Pathetic, Danish has 32, but only 9 symbols for vowels (a, e, y, u, i, o, æ, ø, and å) and some local dialects have more
Danish genders are such a mess that at least one dialect has reassigned the genders of a huge part of the words
It also has the [Danish stød] on top of the soft d's, which is also terrible for foreigners to pronounce
That just makes it easier, you actually know what sounds to make
I still don't know how to say kamelåså

Hvad hedder det
-> What is it called
Likely because 9pm **is** pretty late for the makers of those memes lmao
I want
But I’m also on Reddit
Googled it, that entire party currently has a total of 59 people who has given their signature for them to run at our next election, which probably goes a long way to explain why I hadn't heard of them until now
In Denmark we say,"were you born in a tent
Or: "were you born in an S-train
What are some off the most weirdest laws in your country
Well there's this law, that I dont know if its still in effect but nonetheless
It basically said that if a Dane sees a swedish person walking over the frozen Øresund, then that dane can freely walk over to that said dane and beat him with a stick, free of charge
It’s okay I have learned something new
So I see it as an absolute win
Denmark has it as well - there used to be two different rates, one for radio only, and one for radio and tv
Then they changed the rules, and you had to pay if you had an internet connection as well, since you could access the public radio/tv station through that as well
It has now changed again, and is done through normal taxation
Before that, there would be people driving around knocking on doors asking people who didn't pay if they had a TV in the house
Ow I have actually heard of this law in a tv show about someone who sailed from Denmark to Svalbard
The Electoral College is workong as intended (other than faithless electors), the weird thing is the overreach of the federal government
Definitely not
In the word "hvis" we don't pronounce the "h". There are several other examples of this occurrence
"Lære" (to teach) and "lærer" (teaches) is pronounced almost the same
A lot of our verbs are the same way
We have several "blunt D's" which are D's you can't hear
Basically spelling is a shit show
In Danish there are three ekstra letters: Æ, Ø, Å, each with destinct sounds, which we use I many words but we don't really ever use the letters, it can be confusing
Haha
(I wish
I envy the languages that actually make sense)
Basically the only words spelled as they sound are ø and å.
Don’t forget about the vowels changing sound in different words
Eks:
Emil: E sounds like e and I sounds like I
Rikke: E sounds like Ø and I sound like A
... I feel sorry for foreigners learning Danish
Og "i"
This is due to the fact, that we simply don't have enough letters to properly represent all the vowel sounds in Danish
I think outside of a language spoken by 30 000 people in the Caucasus Mountains and maybe another equally small language, Danish has the most vowel sounds, with like 25-30 different vowel sounds(There are 4-5 different ways to pronounce A)
Untill we get more letters in the alphabet, we are stuck with this
That's the case for other words ending in "ag" as well
Other examples include: flag (flay) flagstang (flaostang)
But the question is then, why didn't the Irish alphabet just adopt those letters
It seems pretty bizarre to use a digraph, when a perfectly good and widely used letter exists, and it isn't already in use in the alphabet
> You're completely right
I find many similarities between the Irish and Icelandic alphabets
To outsiders, they seem like there's no logic with them
Apart from -ll, what things do you think are out of the ordinary in Icelandic
To a Scandinavian, Icelandic spelling makes perfect sense
This just opens up for so many more questions though
But I still have virtually no idea how that would be pronounced, due to Irish following completely different orthographic rules from other languages
Is C a C? Or is it pronounced like, for example, a P?
I'm not even Polish, but if you started to write Krakuw and Tarnuw for example, sure that's how they are pronounced anyway, but it just looks too wrong
The Irish-English animosity was not one of the questions, that arose though
It was more, why letters like J and V were seen as English, when they are common in most other European languages, especially since O, I, C, A, E, H, etc
are considered alright
What I am going at, is that Irish orthography is pretty unique in its fairly liberal use of digraphs and trigraphs, which makes it fairly indecipherable by an outsider, and some of them are fairly funky, like how mh is a v sound and bh can be a w sound
As an example, I am pretty sure most people who's only prerequisite would be knowing the Latin alphabet, would have an easier time reading and reproducing Malaysian or Hausa than Irish
"Jeg skal lige en tur lige på det lille hus" - "I have to go to the little house", is a polite way of saying that you need to the toilet
In general most of course just say WC or toilet
More "fun" terms are: "det lille hus" (the small house), "potten" (the pot), "tronen" (the throne), and then a bunch of crude terms for what you actually do out there ;)
The little house - det lille hus
The barrol - tønden
You would say, I need to go on/to the barrol - jeg skal på tønden
Det lille hus (the little house)
My dad calls it "skidderen" which pretty much means "the shitter"
"Answering a call of nature" means to go to the toilet in English as well
The barrol, also used quite alot
If it fits it sits
What word/saying do you like to make foreigners try to pronounce in your language
In Denmark it’s a major meme how we always go “try to say rød grød med fløde
” when meeting a foreigner
It contains both the soft D and the Ø, both of which are challenging to pronounce for most people
I also sometimes try to make foreigners say "røget ørred i Rødovre" ("smoked trout in Rødovre", which is a city outside of Copenhagen)
It's got soft D and Ø as well, but it's also got the weird G  that sounds like a J in røget and the weird R's in ørred, which makes it sound like we are gargling more than speaking a language
If it’s just a singular word I want someone to try and pronounce then it’s “Æblegrød”. It has both the Æ and the Ø. Translates to Apple Porridge
Not even saying this to hate on you, but the Swedish 'sju'-syllable is the ugliest sound in existence
And then he said “Danish sounds like someone is speaking with a potato in their mouth”.
Funniest shit I’ve ever seen
Hmm
Seems like it would just be pronounced kyriø
I’ll do you better, THR
Fuck I hated saying “three”
As someone learning Spanish: where
Which words
My life is a lie
“Hard” when it comes to languages is basically just code word for “my native language doesn’t have it or anything similar to it”. How hard a language is depends a lot on your native language
The D in Ciudad doesn’t at all sound the same as in fløde, but I digress
My Spanish teacher is Chilean and they’re apparently hard to understand for other Spanish speakers
We just use their names
We don't have words like that
It's certainly not the norm
We usually use the english words (dude, bro, y'all) but "gutter" or "folkens" are common too
I mean in general, I don't think we are a country big on any type of nicknames
Be it for the individual person or a group
But as a woman, I might call my female friends "tøser", "de damer" or even a cheeky "gutter", though those hardly seem like slang names
Disagree
Bro, makker, gutter and simply "drengene" are very common
I very much disagree with you
I'm 20 for context
That's... not true
We've got bror, bro (from English), brormand, makker, kammerat, fyr, gut, and søs, tøser, all of which are used often
Also teenagers often call their friend group “holdet”, the team
My dad calls his friends “drengene”, the boys
Same and I'm 43
Other people have said the same, but a lot of people clearly agree with me as well
I think this is a regional difference
Nobody says *brorsan* anymore
God no
Not at all - Tøser literally just means girls
It would be like saying "chicks" or "birds" in English, though slightly less slangish as tøs is a little old-fashioned and I think originally it was literally the word for a female who was in between being a "pige" (girl) and "kvinde" (woman)
It just seems odd to me that there would be some region of Denmark where all of these were absent
I live in Aarhus, grew up north of Copenhagen, and have family in Sønderjylland, and everyone I know from all three places uses these words frequently
And I've lived in several places in Nordjylland and have never heard anyone call each other by those names, except for tøser like once or twice
And granted, asking my few friends is not a very big group to go on, but none of them have either
According to my dictionary from when I was learning German "tussen" in German is the same "luder" in Danish, which means whore or "kælling" which is an old word for "old woman" which now means something more in the line of "bitch". Tøs, in general, is always either positive (often used by adults to girls/women or between girls themselves as an endearing term for a person who is young and female) or neutral
My Aalborg friends jokingly use ‘drengeren’ all the time
We actually used the term "tysker tøs" as well, but it's only that entire term that's negative in Denmark, not the term "tøs" in general
There is said to be a lake in Sweden shaped like the Danish island of Sjælland (where Copenhagen is located)
The norse godess of wisdom, Gefion, wanted more land for Denmark
She asked the king of Sweden for land, he said no
Then she slept with him and he said yes, you can get all the land you can plough in one night
Gefion turned her sons into oxens and ploughed out Sjælland
There is a giant [statue] of her in Copenhagen
It's said that the island of Sjælland was created when a giant took a piece of Sweden and cast it into the ocean
The lake where he took the dirt from is now where the Vänern is today
A sailor was at sea when suddenly his ship sank,
the cause is said to be a meteorite
He woke up on a coast alone, all his crewmembers drowned
A virgin tribal woman found him and he followed, but her intentions were not good
She cut off his penis and ate it, and proceeded to boil him in a big pot
This is the sad story of Skipper Bent
somwhat Denmark
What do you mean by that
No idea tbh, it might not even exist
That's absolutely not true at all - almost all Norse Mythology is found in Iceland there's absolutely no sources that indicate that norse mythology is any more from Sweden and Norway than Denmark
Couldn’t they be mixed up so two countries had slightly different myths about the same lakes
As someone with a masters degree in History: you are remembering wrong
Wasn't he also partially eaten
Not my country, but I did live there for a while in the early 90s so
Russians eat ice cream all year round
-10 degrees and winter
Watch people queue up when some ice cream vendor sets up show at a corner and starts selling Пломбир for a decently low price
I found it weird at first, but after a little while I got into it too, and now my wife calls me odd when we're taking a winter walk, and I get a craving for a cone
Well
thanks
If Sweden is ever invaded, I promise I will make plans to liberate you guys, and tell you about them after the war is over
Well, we appreciate the efforts anyways
>they settled on popular drinking song "Helan går".
I am *so* not surprised by this
> The Mac command key ⌘ is based from the Swedish "point of interest" symbol on maps
What makes you think that's specifically Swedish
Other countries use the symbol for the same thing
Hmm
last year we celebrated the 800th birthday of our flag, which according to legend fell from the sky under the battle of Lyndanisse in 1219 and helped us win
The german troops in north-west Europe capitulated effective at midnight 5th of may
Do you mean Hotel St
Petersburg
Right across from Aurora
I had some friends visit, and they had a room there with an *awesome* view over the river
> Operation rädda Danmark
and instantly I head a boy cry out: "Rädda Joppe
The Canadian oppressors will not succeed in conquering our beautiful island
ah St
Isaac's Square
I was thinking that you might be thinking of Palace Square for some reason
\*sigh* it's been more than 20 years since I was in St
Petersburg last
I really want to go there again
It's basically a drinking contest at this point
The question is, if we can handle their whisky better than they can handle our snaps
I would prefer we just split the island down the middle
That way, we can both have a 2nd land border and go visit each other
At the moment, we both just have a single land border to the south
Nice - we still have the 50øre here in Denmark, but it's pretty useless
I don't think it will be long before we get rid of that as well
Yes, it was taken out of circulation on October 1st 2008
Do you receive a lot of single dollar bills
And does that have anything to do with the sillicone in your username
This is simiar to what scouts is in Denmark
We have the option of boy and girl scouts up until 2002-ish
(I was in the last girl scouts group in Denmark, and I believe it closed down around this time), but ever since then, it's been mixed and it's like the scouts described above
I remember learning how to set a tent, wield a knife, catch and prepare a fish as well as just having fun and hanging out outside
Don't we still have girl scouts
Because a couple of years ago there were something about the group I'm in of buying one of their huts
I believe they're called "De grønne pigespejdere", and it seems (with some quick googling) like they still have ~120 groups
There are definitely still girl scouts in Denmark
Det Danske Spejderkorps are predominantly mixed, but there are a few girl scout (and boy scout) groups e.g. Broager Pigespejder in Southern Jutland
As I wrote above, I might be misremembering, as I was a child at the time, plus it was ages ago, so honestly, a lot can have changed
But the story was De Danske Pigerspejdere merged with the boys in the 70s, and only a few select pure girl groups (no matter the age group) existed since then, and by the time I started our group was the last group left
They then closed a few years after I stopped being a scout
It is worth noting there's a clear difference between Green and Blue scouts
Honestly, a lot of Blue don't even consider Green scouts to be "real scots", as they are first and foremost a religious group, not a scout group (plus a whole lot of other political and rivalry stuff that I honestly never was old enough to care about when I was in scouts - all I know is that my blue-scout friends still turn red in the face when people mention green scouts and vice versa)
We were told that we were the last ones that were 100% girl no matter the age, that's all I know, but like I said, I was a child and this is way over 10 years ago, so my memory might be faulty - but my mum even stayed on the DDS board for longer than I was a spejder (two years extra I think, she still complains about it) because it was closing down due to lack of attendence and several parents worked hard to keep it open, so to keep the final pure DDS girl scouts open
Last I heard, that group closed and the final none-religious Girl Scouts group was "dead". But like I said, I was a child, so there might be some nuances I misremember or misunderstood
It's true that there's a difference between KFUM (green) and DDS (blue)
As I am blue scout myself, I know that we don't like being called green scouts, and vice versa
But from my personal experiences, I would say that it is nothing more than a joke, a friendly rivalry
Where we accept each others as scouts, just not openly
And while it's true that while there have been noticeable difference between KFUM and DDS
From what I know we do mostly the same things, as I am friends with with a couple of green scouts they aren't much of a "Christian society" anymore
And there's 1 point that both green and blue scouts agree on, and that is that FDF aren't real scouts
Denmark was 100% made of off germanic tribes, so no actual ruins, but there has been found some ancient roman potter (especially interesting to find some terra sigillata, as it was very precious)
And there's also a site, where the first villages, where there was a clear house size difference was found - which is believed to be the first "king" or at least tribe leader, who had the domination over more land, which is believed to be directly affected by a roman friendship, when the Romans still had their kinda friendly foreign policy
That's a Danish Summer
"Abandon all hope, ye who enter here"
..also it's cold, snowy, and Vikingy
2018 was the hottest summer i've ever experienced
All the grass died and turned yellow, it looked like a savannah
And it was followed by the coldest winter i've ever experienced
It was a crazy year for the weather
[Suspekt - Kinky Fætter]
The song title translates to "Kinky cousin". The song is overly explicit (the chorus is literally a girl moaning) which is why many people enjoy listening to it at partys, but I personally enjoy it for all the other reasons
The intro has a cool violin build up, the flow is really good and the lyrics are so in your face with a lot of attitude, which I like
[Hun er min Volvo B18
210
This is played a most parties here and people love it
[Lars Lilholt - Hvidsten Kro]
This guy makes all these folksy songs that really isn't something I enjoy listening to, however this particular song has struck a chord with me because of the subject he sings about
The Hvidsten group was a group of Danish resistance fighters during the occupation by the germans in world war 2
They were a bunch of regular guys, lead by Marius Fiil, the innkeeper of Hvidsten Inn
Their role was to pick up agents and/or weapons dropped via parachute by the RAF and distribute them to the various sabotage groups in the country
They were active for about a year until one agent got caught and tortured by the germans and he revealed the entire group who was subsequently arrested, tried and executed
I love this song because it does a good job in telling their story
Probably Scarlet Pleasure - Deja Vu
They're a pretty popular Danish band, but mostly popular with 14 year old girls, so I'm not really the stereotypical listener, being a 19 year old guy
But they're real funky, it's a they're not international known
this song is actually amazing, and the lyrics are just so
wholesome
Definitely a banger
When Suspekt is giving concerts, this song is of course one of their main hits, and the lyric (or chant) is added to the instrumental part of the chorus "Jeg har kneppet til den her sang" (literally: "I've shagged to this song / while this song was playing)
Always gets the crowd riled up of course
That the weather an interesting topic for conversation and that Denmark has the best educational system and the funniest humor in the world
Our healthcare system is good
That’s about it I think
Derry Girls is absolutely one of the best shows I've watched recently
I binged the shit out of it and the recommended it to all my friends, haha
And cheese
And wine
Pretty normal when you eat them
Us too
Us too
I know
Except for Norway
We might be
It's sunny today, but not as much as yesterday
But it's nice that the raining stopped
Tomorrow should be cloudy
If thats true than skåne is a part of Denmark
I like Italian wine best
But I thought the French would all agree they have the best wine
Everybody knows that your educational system rocks
Except Danes, who like to think that we are number one there
Amen brother
If someone from Denmark tries to speak english, then it's very obvious that they're danish, especially if they are from an older generation
I don't know what it is, but I think it's just a heavy accent that carries over
Yep

Reddit actually does have profile pictures since the redesign
Just hover over someones name for it to appear
No-one uses them though, for obvious reasons
Where i live, if they knock and you are not at home, the package will return to a posthouse and you can pick it up there
Also you can send your package to f.x a supermarket and you can pick it up there
The most effective Swedish invasion of Denmark must the the fact that we have Postnord now
Pain and suffering
Honestly it's a lot better than when we had Postdanmark
For the last two years I haven't had nearly the same problems as with Postdanmark in the past or GLS now
It probably is
Our former government spent a decade trying to "improve effectiveness" in Post Danmark, by reducing budgets and laying off anyone with a long employment history
Meanwhile income from mail itself went down and private package delivery companies snapped up the profitable and easy-to-handle small packages
The only reason Post Denmark didn't go bankrupt bankrupt was probably because it couldn't be allowed to stop functioning
Overall I'd say Post Denmark was the victim of classic "New Public Management", just like the British NHS
I wouldn't say that's how they present it in Denmark atleast not in media
We had PostDanmark before which while it wasn't great was better than what service is now being provided
And you are right in the understanding that it's mostly digital here, we have E-Boks to receive pretty much any information from the government or other government related institutions
I've pretty much given up on Postnord personally at this point
I'd rather pay slightly more for GLS or something equivalent to that to make sure the service is good
Here Postnord as only delivery option is usually a reason to pick another webshop
"Mørke" in Denmark
(Mørke means Darkness)

East Berlin
I would imagine Kaliningrad
Tiraspol in Transnistria
Well Chisinau was really uninteresting culture wise
It's not for nothing that moldova is the least visited country in Europe

All cities are special in their own way
I was about to say Warsaw because of the kind of bland architecture there, But then I then it occurred to me that i distinctively remember Warsaw because of the Soviet vibe that I got when I was there, which was really interesting
It's long been considered a Ghost Town
The first picture in the Imgur gallery you linked [here] genuinely looks like an art cover for a dystopian game/book
Can confirm
Was there on Interrail
It's god some old buildings just like any other European city but nothing that interesting
I did however try an amazing burger in hipster burger joint
One of the best burgers I ever had
*aaaaaall the clubs have been clooooooosed down*
I think gentrification has been a larger problem for Amsterdam
A lot of the neighbourhoods in the surrounding areas of the city center don’t have a lot of uniqueness to them
My dads from around there
I think it has something to do with the dark architecture, dark monotone rows of houses
Not to mention the fact that the weather is often gloomy
Oh and crime, frankly
There's plenty of those situations in Danish, but the first two pairs that spring to mind are:
*Mord* and *mor* \- meaning murder and mum
To make it even harder, the d in *mord* is silent
and one where there's not even a difference in spelling, simply in pronunciation
*Dør* and *dør* \- meaning to die or door
in danish some words are spelled the exact same way but have different meanings, like dør(door) and dør(dying)
vildt sådan at komplimentere den også. Det eneste sted jeg har prøvet det er ved gynækolog
In Denmark uni is free and you also get up to roughly 800€ a month by the government for studying
Universities are free in Denmark which also applies to EU citizens
That said, many courses are taught in Danish on both bachelor and master level which probably would limit your choice by a lot - especially since you need to speak Danish to actually apply to those courses
Though if you do that you can apply for something called SU which essentially is a government subsidy for students which can cover most student housing offers, basic food options and so on
You won't get rich but you will get by
But if you're not from the EU then it will cost money each semester
I'm not sure about the prices for that
Non-EU/EEA:
**Annual tuition fees for full-degree students**
USD 8,000-21,000 / Euro 6,000-16,000 (DKK 45,000-120,000)
Scholarships and grant are possible:
For international students there are some extra rules to be able to get the 800€ a month, like you have to work 10-12 hours a week
Just make something clear:
This do only applies for EU or EEA citizens - for Non-EU and Non-EEA citizens you can not get the money from the government or study for free
Not a loan, yours to keep
It's pretty average for students to work about 15hours a week, besides study during uni time
You can supliment with a low interest loan every month if you should need a little extra
No, none of it is a loan
But you can get a low interest loan in addition to it
No, you don't have to pay back anything
If live at home you get ~$130-800 depending on your parents’ income
Yes, for EU citizens there are a few more rules, like you have to work 10-12 hours a week
Theres a way for non citizens to get it, I think you have to work 10 hours a week but I could be wrong
And you need to apply residence permit and a lot of other fun stuff, if you are not from an EU or EEA county
I think anyone knows that they need a study visa or other visa to be able to study when they are not from a EU or EEA country
You did just make it sound like anyone could get SU by saying "international students" where it is EU and EEA citizens that only can that
I will just add that the maximum for living at home is €361
(This is what I'm currently getting, and I'm living at home with my mom who has a low income)
Let me save you the trobule and just give you the site with all of the information:
not anymore, but you do have to work at least a few hours a week to get it
You are right, I’m just so used to call them international students since that is what they are called at my university
Oh, i thought it was closer to the living alone SU
Phone services and internet*
I pay around 15€ for super phone service, lots of data, free roaming etc
9€ for high speed internet
*Relative to income
Bread, cake, beer, internet and heat
One of the greatest things about being in Romania in the summer is the abundance of basically free watermelon
There's a guy who recently opened a few coffee houses here, who wanted to go against the trend of coffee being obscenely expensive
No matter which coffee you get, it's 10kr(1,4€), which is at least a fourth of what other places charge
Business seems to be going fine
I once visited a restaurant in an industrial area outside of Bergamo many years ago
All the way untill the bill was handed to me, I was convinced in the menu, that the prices per pizza was 1 euro
10kr
Damn, that's cheap, I could actually see myself becoming a regular there
I like the idea of cafés, but they're, as you mentioned, obscenely expensive here, so I just don't go to any
There's 2 in Copenhagen already selling for 15 and 20 kr
, I was happy to discover the 20 kr
one by accident
Cloetta chocolate bar with Gott & Blandat in it
Love it
[It's very new, but judging from the fact that they only started half a year ago or so] I guess it won't be long untill we see locations in the rest of the country
>  in regular supermarkets was Moldova, but they have lower incomes so it would be more as a %)
If they want cheap wine, they make it themselves
I HATE them
Especially at night
I am really uncomfortable with them
Tbh I am scared of thunder
Yes, even if I am outside
They’ll never find me alive
If you break something, you lay waste to it:
Break -> Ødelægge -> Øde (Waste/Empty) & lægge (lay)
If you destroy something, you reduce it to nothing:
Destroy -> Tilintetgøre -> Til (to) & intet (nothing) & gøre (do/make)
Vacuum Cleaner - Støvsuger - Dustsucker
Tu me fais chier = you're making me shit (you're annoying me)
Same in Danish except the second one

I don’t know, I don’t really think we have a word for it
That whole area is just brystvorte
Hej, mit navn er John, det er en fornøjelse at møde dig
Hvor er du fra
Hi, my name is John, it is a pleasure to meet you
Where are you from
Danish and english are quite similar
Here's a Danish translation of your example:
Hej, jeg hedder John, det glæder mig at møde dig
Hvor er du fra
Hello, I named John, it happies me to meet you
Where are you from
Though, this is a really boring example to showcase how Danish differs from English
Here's a better one:
(When I arrived at the station, I noticed that I hadn't gotten off at the right place)
Da jeg ankom på stationen, bemærkede jeg, at jeg ikke var stået af det rigtige sted
When I arrived at station-the, noticed I that I not was stood off the right place
Hej, jeg hedder John, det er en fornøjelse at møde dig
Hvor er du fra
Hej, I called John, it is a pleasure to meet you
Where are you from
Hej mit navn er John, det er en fornøjelse at møde dig
Hvor kommer du fra
Hi my name is John it is a pleasure to meet you
Where coming you from
It works not with all sentences
If I begun to talk like here, would it be easy enough to understand me, but it would not be completely perfect
Hej
Mit navn er John
Det er rart at møde dig
Hvor er du fra
Hi, My name is John, it is nice to meet you, where are you from
For Denmark the most dangerous animal would be the Wasp
Statistically responsible for 1-2 deaths each year
If you mean "If I encounter this animal I'm in danger
" it would probably be the wolf, but those are very few in numbers and generally flee from humans
cats are dangerously cute
(on a serious note, probably ticks
Me: dad, what's the most dangerous animal in denmark
My dad: kids
Thanks dad
I actually thought the European adder (hugorm in Danish) would be on the list as well, but the last time a healthy adult in Scandinavia died from a bite, was in 1994 in Sweden
TBE is spreading among ticks in Denmark at the moment, so it's not just Lyme disease we need to worry about there anymore
As far as I can see, there haven't been any deaths yet though
I was thinking maybe the adder as well - though only 7 people have died from it since 1900, around 400 do get bitten every year and 70 of those have to stay at hospital for treatment
Also maybe the tick - around 300 people every year get seriously ill from tick-bites
Snake is slange in Danish, and orm is generally considered to apply to worm :) but orm actually means any long creature without legs (including worms, snakes, dragons, you name it)
For exampel Midgårdsormen is the Danish name for Jörmungandr
My favourite from my time was during an exercise one of our guys had night watch and while he was sitting there he noticed someone in the woods
As he shouts the “password” the guy is spooked and fall into a small stream
Because of this he doesn’t reply to the shouting of my mate, so he opens fire
Turns out it was our platoon leader out for a piss
A day later on the same exercise we accidentally scared the shit out of an old couple and their dog began running around our camp barking, not very ideal for staying hidden
If you can talk the Czechs into paying us Danegeld to stay away we'd gladly go drink somewhere else
But you took your sweet time getting rid of us
Maybe we can put our flags together and tell Norway to join in on the fun Kalmarunionen skal leve
Lets just plant scandinavian flags everywhere
The more the merrier, yes
Let's have the English pay Danegeld again
In Denmark er have a "statsminister" which is translated to Prime Minister
However,we have minesterial posts, which are ministers who focus on specific things, such as economics, culture, integration, among a lot of other things
In total, excluding the prime minister, we have 19 ministers
They work under the prime minister
Doing his best to emulate Putin
The public busses have a European flag on the roof
But i think if you asked 10 people on the day why, less than half would be able to tell you
You need a permit to raise another countrys national flag, except the other Nordic countries or the EU or UN flag
So no Estonian flags
Like this :-)
Those two flags are pretty much a prime example of the "Can I copy your homework
" meme
Thats wrong
It is worded weird so i get how machine translation would get that impression, but the  Greenlandic flag, the Faroese flag, the Nordic countries' flags, the UN flag and the EU flag are also allowed
Not just on poles but publicly
Its an old law to prevent the English from bombing random Danish towns when they saw a German Flag
You can use flags for non national things though, like the gay flag
No problem indoors
I actually used to have a big Stars & Stripes hanging over my gun cabinet so it couldn't be seen from the outside through the window
You could, but it's doubtful that it would actually happen
If someone informed the police, they might stop by to earn their pay check, but it's rather unlikely if you did it on one day
Some people did fly the Stars and Stripes on their flag pole regularly, and they were asked to take it down, because they didn't have permission to do it
Olsen banden (Denmark)
Pepole serm to recomend alot of serious film
This is a comedy movie about a heist
The hunt
Mads mikkelsen nailed it like jesus on the cross
Adams Æbler (Adams apples) is excellent
From Denmark, i'd nominate these:
Pusher (1996)
Jagten (the hunt) (2012)
Blinkende lygter (Flickering Lights) (2000)
Coincidentally all the movies feature Mads Mikkelsen, though he only has a lead role in "The Hunt"
These are all different genres
Watch all 14 Olsen Banden movies
Adam's Apples for Denmark
A dark comedy sort of in the vein of In Bruges
These movies are actually moderately popular in Poland
I have seen Polish dubbed Gang Olsena dvds in Polish supermarkets several times
They were some of the only western movies allowed during the communist era
Hvad med alle Olsen Banden filmene istedet
I second Utøya
One of the most intense cinema experiences I ever had
If you're going to see it make sure that there are no dstractions so that you can fully emerge yourself in it
All the movies you mentioned are great, but this one is the most is the one that left the biggest impression with me
>Kriget (Denmark)
Krigen\*
Does it have anything with the band in it
You misspelled inferior
Because Bergman is one of the greatest directors of all time
> It is about a bunch of guys who live in southern Sweden that enjoy playing football and going to Denmark to beat UP danes
That sure sounds like something a Swede would do
I didn't even know there is a Netflix version
Why would you make that
The original was so great exactly so great because it focuses on the youths and you really feel the terror they must have felt
Poland, as is tradition
That seed bank in Svalbard
Mongolia
Take that Djenghiz
Get the longboats brothers
They also have a scientist looking exactly like Gordon Freeman, the apocalypse could happen there any second
Jacinda Ardern, Sanna Marin, Erna Solberg or Angela Merkel
No idea why i've only chosen women, but they all strike me as competent and compassionate leaders
Edit: i know Ardern is not european, but saw others mention outside of Europe too :)
[Sanna Marin] from Finland or [Zuzana Čaputová] from Slovakia
I like our Danish PM, but if we absolutely had to replace her, I would like to have the Finnish PM
well your president was 1 of my choices ;)
Mette Frederiksen is largely popular in Denmark
Shes doing a good job imo
> Mette Frederiksen for sure, she seems to be doing a wonderful job in Denmark as their prime minister
She is hands down one of the most authoritarian prime ministers we've had in post-war society
Sure, she's not Putin or Xi Jinping, but still, compared to what we are used to, it's not normal to have a prime minister, who doesn't take the parliament into council, or who has an unelected special advisor, who has access to political work groups, without being accountable to the electorate
If you want her, please take her
Our parliament had to vote for a law, which they were told was made on scientific background by the responsible authorities in "embedsværket". That turned out to be a complete lie
So not only did they not take parliament into council, they deliberately misinformed the parliament, which is a breech of "ministeransvarsloven".
> Dont see why special advisors (Whatever that entails) are unelected is something bad
They are unaccountable to the electorate
If they screw up, we don't have the power to remove them
That is very undemocratic
[Here's more about it, in case you are interested] This thing is completely unprecedented in modern Danish history
> your prime minister
This sounds A LOT more like an issue with the agency in question than with Mette
No, it was regarding introduction of a certain set of restrictions
The wording that the parliament was presented for insinuated the law was written on background of evaluation from the Health Authorities
It turned out that it wasn't, as it was simply just made on gut reactions, but they didn't say that, and purposely misled the parliament to get the necessary votes for the bill, as the Social Democrats do not command a majority in parliament
I'm all for transparency in government, this was a very clear breach of that
You miss the point, I don't know if it's on purpose
The government, when they wanted to do the lockdown in the spring, said their plan was informed by the relevant public agencies in charge of health, and got the other parties to support their lockdown
The thing was that it was not made on background of the recommendations of the health agencies, the government had simply lied to the rest of the parliament, when they said they had that, in order to lend credence to their policy
It's not that the government is not allowed to do purely political decisions
The problem is that they lie, to make it seem like it happens on a scientific background in order to gain the needed support in parliament
I came to appreciate how blunt and visceral Danish is when I lived abroad and spoke English as my main language for nearly four years
When your vocabulary is mostly Latin or French, the speech can't help but take on a cerebral quality that sort of gentrifies the raw and unwashed "barbaric yawps" of one's self-expression, more so when you, as a second language speaker, have learned middle class English rather than council estate English
It was such a relief coming home, and I had no idea it would be like that, having had no particular fondness for my native tongue before that experience
Lækker is also used the Dutch way in Danish
Well, the Danish use of "lækker" perfectly resembles til Dutch way to use it
We describe everything with it, just like the Dutch
It's actually quite a new thing for the Chinese to write the word 她 for *she/her* instead of 他 (*he/him*)
They started doing that in imitation of the English difference between *he* and *she* by replacing the *semantic compound* "human" with "woman" around a hundred years ago **and I hate it
** It is so much better to have the ability to remain ambiguous
I suppose our pickeld and marinated herrings are somewhat uncommon
I love the Spanish cousine, but callos was for me the only disgusting experience in Spain
A change has happened here within the last 10-20 years
Nowadays you look odd at people who eat fries without any kind of mayo
Pure mayo is unusual, but garlic mayo/aïoli, chili mayo or any kind of herby mayo is available everywhere
> Tørrfisk = Dry fish, fish hanged to dry, smells disgusting but last essentially forever
I mean, some foreigners liked that so much it became their national dish(Bacalhau in Portugal)
Cured meat is awesome
No matter if it's from fish, cows or pork
Exactly
I mean, gravlax is just sort of what salami is to pork or other kinds of cured meat
For Denmark:
- Postal service here fucking sucks
I was shocked to learn how much of Europe has stuff like Amazon Prime and one day delivery
- Things such as services, clothes and food, especially restaurants, are expensive
Yes, also relative to income
We lack a restaurant culture
Copenhagen is amazing for restaurants and street food from all corners of the world (or so I’ve had multiple even Southern Europeans tell me), yet average people go out to eat like once a month or less
Much less in the countryside
- 8 months of the year is just one big rainy blob weather-wise
Winters without proper snow are very common, which renders winter and “wow cold Scandinavia” pretty useless
- We have a tendency to “settle” socially speaking, especially after a certain age
In youth friend circles are pretty fluid but after that it’s like people retrieve into the same 2 friends
It’s not as extreme as memes make it out to be, a study actually found we are less socially isolated than Southern and Eastern Europe, but it is a tendency
And yeah we don’t small talk on the street much, and don’t use many politeness phrases (none of that last part bothers me personally though)
- School system is
alright but it’s laughably bad compared to what it could be with how much we spend on it (does not apply to Finland obviously)
I’m not personally affected by it cuz white, but racism
It’s disgustingly common for people to deny that racism even exist here (fucking lol what the actual fuck)
“Like of course we have individual racists but no systemic racism
” Fucking stop
Job applications with middle eastern names gets turned down way more often
Bouncers are extremely racist and would rather let 13 year olds in than someone middle eastern
A law was just made where police had the authority to take valuables like designer clothes from “young brown men who misbehave”, as our PM so lovingly called it
I don’t know if it’s worse or better than in any other countries, but the fact that so many people have the absolute audacity to deny that it even exists must be so discouraging for people of color
I do really love it here in general though
I had to think for a long time to come up with all of these
It always seems a bit weird to me when Scandinavians complain about the prices
Like yeah, it’s expensive here when you compare to other countries, but our salaries are also higher
A cashier at a supermarket can earn 3
500€ eg
But sure, if you just returned from Hungary where a beer is 2€ and you come home and pay 7€ for the same beer (and Denmark has cheaper alcohol than the rest of Scandinavia) it sucks
But complaining about our prices is a pretty Danish thing I guess, hence why people flock in thousands every day to go to Germany to buy candy and beer
Things that I envy Canada for:
\- Huge, diverse country
\- Mindblowing nature (Denmark is so flat)
\- Real snow
\- Legalized cannabis
(Denmark)
Darkness
Winter depressions
Alcohol overconsumption
Big usage of Anti depression medicine
Hard to make new friends if they’re not childhood friends
Law of jante
Cold winters
(Personal opinion)lack of initiation
lack of city life outside drinking culture, at least for many youths
Moderate politics if people you want more extreme politics
(Plus for many)
Lots of rain
Cold rain
Foreigners talking about only Copenhagen
Ghetto problems
Muslim problems
Gang problems
(Personal opinion) no Euro and we have to do mathematics whether we travel outside our country, same with foreigners who have euros who visit here
We have a weird form of “currency nationalism”
As y’all can see we do have negative sides and it isn’t paradise on earth
It should be noted that those numbers are for Norway
Right now in DK we have light from 7:45 ish to 16:30 ish
Which I think is totally bearable
Also being a small and somewhat homogeneous country, people tend to get narrowminded and complaining about the smallest issues
Politicians (some) will engage in minor conflicts and we are too convinced that our way of life is superior
If you order before 5 pm on weekdays, you can at times be lucky that the package will delivered next day to a 'pakkeshop'.
I think the “not allowed to stand out” thing is very exaggerated
It’s just that a lot of Scandinavia is incredibly rural and have a small-town mentality that you would find anywhere
Whereas I as a city person don’t feel it at all
It comes from a satirical text from the early 1900’s, who was parodying a small town in Denmark
In my opinion law of Jante is actually mostly a good thing
No we don’t, that’s a myth
This sounds very universal, and Denmark is not more socially conservative than more diverse less ethically homogenous countries, quite the opposite, if anything
It's pretty difficult to make a case that the first country to legalize porn and officially recognize same sex unions is above average "narrow-minded".
Yes, I personally can't see a possibility of change when the four biggest parties have more or less all bought into neoliberalism
I think overall we’re much more left leaning in Dk in relation to Germany
Although I agree with many of OPs points, the fact is that the bar is just so much higher than most countries in the world
Anyone who thinks a socialist country exists, let alone in the Western world, has not even bothered to learn the most basic definition of socialism
The idea that *any* country “have all its shit together” is just false
Do you think Danish politicians just sit around saying “well we are a perfect paradise so I can just go home now”?
I think the gentrification and housing market and a lot of what Tony says is not that bad compared to most of the world
But that says less about how awesome Denmark is and more about how awful the world is in general
Fuck PostNord
All my homies hate PostNord
>Btw thanks Denmark for ruining our postal service too
You do understand PostNord is mostly run by Swedes in the mother company PostNord AB
We definently get snow in the winter, but rarely 'real snow', as in it stays on the ground for more than a few days before turning to grey mush- big snowy landscapes
Those are mostly just childhood memories now
And yeah I get where you are coming from in regards to travel time
It takes about 4 hours driving from one end of Denmark to the other
I really only started appreciating this after I came home from backpacking in SE Asia
It also is mostly subjective
The law of jante made me somewhat self hating in the past and I also currently gets criticized for always thinking I’m not good enough and not allowed to praise myself in the head
But I’m also an example of someone who is really caught in its laws and follows it to a tii wherever I want to or not
I feel utterly bad to say I agree with u/ehnej, and that I don't need more friends than the ones from my childhood who are still my friends
I realized I may be part of the problem
Or what kind of food should be served in Kindergarten or if people are allowed to wear religious symbols
Exactly
We have gentrification, lack of funding for schools, trade unions are weakening etc
But in so much of the world these problems are ten times as bad
This does not mean we should not work on them, but in this thread I don’t think “gentrification” as a Scandinavian issue makes much sense
We’re much better when it comes to the housing market than most places
And yet people spew it like gospel
[Primarily a good thing]
It discourages hierarchy and being a smug asshole
For me, I’ve always felt it as [“don’t brag”] rather than “you should hate yourself”.
Someone else in this thread debunked it
Is that the next sunrise or the next time the sun reaches Longyearbyen
Because when I was there, I remember them telling me that it took a fair bit longer before the sun reached above the surrounding mountains
Exactly
It’s kind of like the ghetto discussions
“Ghettos” in the nordics are just not the same thing as in most other countries
I remember a TV segment where a UK policeman visited a danish ghetto and laughed because it was so different
Yeah maybe my interpretation is wrong but it’s generally the interpretation my family shows
Well, I in fact, do like socialism, but Denmark is not a socialist state by any measures
It is very common in Denmark, and completely integrated into day to day use
“Okay” and “coca cola” are the two most statistically universally known words
It's in the danish dictionary
It's completely a part of the language
"When the Norwegians ask if they can have large parts of the North Sea, say no
Me: “Well in a year or so you will be reunited with northern sleswig”
Him: “Aweso-“
Me: “Then we capitulate 6 hours into The next war”
Him: “Ohh
First Germany then America
You had a wild century
I feel like scandinavian history is often just seen as the Viking era, when a lot more had happened throughout time
I think most Danes would say Copenhagen - especially the Amager area, so I'm going to throw a curveball and say [Århus]
Copenhagen and Aarhus are obvious choices, but I'm going with the new [Køge Nord Station] It looks stunning
I would also say Aarhus, while Copenhagen is more international and much larger, Aarhus is dominated by its university which is the largest in all of Scandinavia
The constant expansion of the university (which was established in  1928) has also means that the city has seen large scale growth for a very long time, unlike copenhagen which has even seen population decline at some periods
So a lot of Aarhus is relatively newly built compared to Copenhagen which has a lot more old buildings
Agreed
Vejle's Bølgen and Fjordenhus are cool :)
In Denmark we have a number of Village with only two letter like Ho and No
There might be some town names with only two or even one letter, but I think that Lem deserves an honourable mention - other than being a short name it can also mean a certain part of the male anatomy
> "Au" (which means meadow)
TIL "Au" means different things in different parts of Germany… In North Germany it' a very small river
Dialects of Danish too:
> æ a u å æ ø i æ ø
"I am out on the island in the river"
I think French is closer to English than Dutch
There are so many words in English that come from French
Baggins is "Sækker" in danish which means "to put something in a bag"
In Danish Christopher Robin is named Jakob
I get that sometimes a name is too hard for children, so they give characters a new name, but Christopher is not an unusual name in Denmark
The HP series is filled with name translations to create the same name "clues" the English version has
Lockhart f.ex
is Glitterik Smørhår which means Glittery Butterhair - e.g "smooth as butter". Moody is called Skrækøje (Horror-eye) Dunder (old word for thunder)
Umbridge is called Madam Nikjær, which means someone who is zealous
Lupin for some reason was translated to Lupus, which didn't really change much, as both words are equally well-known by children in Denmark (meaning, basically not at all)
And then, of course, since they had to make the "I am Lord Voldemort", Tom Riddle's name is translated
His name is instead: Romeo G. Detlev Jr
(Jeg er Voldemort), which I  always found funny, seeing as he is supposed to be charming and handsome
Reading Game of Thrones, I absolutley HATE the translation of names and places
Names that have a direct meaning (like snow) is translated, so its Jon Sne
And the names of the direwolves are also translated, and not even directly, Ghost is translated to Hvide (=White)  for some reason
And the places, dont get me started on the places
Kings Landing is Kongs Havn (Kings harbour ish) and Winterfell is Vinterborg (Wintercastle) and I mean, you get where they are coming from, and maybe its just because I saw the series first
But damn I hate it
It’s the same in Danish and I’d imagine Norwegian too
Maybe Lupin was translated so not to confuse it with the flower called Lupin
(Lupinus luteus)
Though lupin in older Danish is called Ulvebønne (Wolf's bean)
Maybe, though I can't imagine that would be much of an issue with kids
I certainly didn't know it back then, and my dad taught nature science
However, Lupus could be confused with the decease, which I suspect more people know about than the Latin name of the flower
In my opinion, it feels sorta similar to what happened to a lot of cathedrals after WW2
Parts of it will remain, it's not like the fire is leveling it to the ground
The facade and large parts of it are made of stone
The rest will be rebuilt
Will it ever be the same
But we aren't losing the cathedral, only the originality of the parts destroyed
Also I think it's worth mentioning that many of the parts of the cathedral themselves aren't **that** old, as it was restored "recently" in the 19th century
I do feel that way, but it's not because it's European (I've never seen it in person), but because it's such an extremely important piece of world culture
I'd feel the same if we lost the Statue of Liberty or Angkor Wat
It feels a bit unempathic to write this, but I honestly feel sadder about this than when a celebrity I like dies
Maybe it's related to the fact that you know people come and go and usually don't last more than 100 years, while there's just some sort of expectation that old cultural heritage will be around forever
As a European I'm devasted, as a historian I'm devasted
However, Notre Dame is burning
It has burned before and once it's rebuild, which it will be, it'll likely burn at some point again
It's terrible
We're losing a part of our history and a part of French and European culture and symbolism
But it's not over and it won't be over for hundreds of years after we die
Notre Dame is not gone, nor will ever be as long as we keep it stand as a remembrance place for our culture
I feel fragile and very mortal
What we have together is so frail
The slightest tremor can destroy us
We need to unite and work together
I agree
I feel devestated that I never had a chance to see that beautiful building
Yes I'm aware, like I said, I'm a historian - it was also not the point of my post at all to debate the semantics of the different fires, nor whether or not what happened is tragic
I think I made it very clear that I believe it's very tragic
That was clearly not the point of what I wrote
In Denmark we grow up on a very rude and sarcastic sort of humor that makes the rest of the world clutch their pearls if used on no Danish citizens
Yes a bit
I am a bit more contained, as I cannot as easily discern the other person's personality from their way of speaking
At the same time I use less slang and speak a more "standard" English than I do Danish
Absolutely
Haven't really thought about it
But it's definitely an interesting question
And now I probably will think about it
I've discussed this in other threads about swearing, but I swear in english when i'm a little annoyed
I swear in Danish when i'm legitimately pissed
It's pretty similar for me: I can be articulate and elegant when communicating
But in English I become white trash
I'm not aware
Maybe outside of EU
The thing is, capitals are often quite large cities
and so there's more traffic and more idiots
Politics are also done in the capital, and so most people hate AT LEAST half the politicians
Personally i never understood the point of a capital city
I've really got very few positive things to say about Copenhagen
and if i lived there, i'd spend most of my time trying to move out
The same in Denmark with Copenhagen
As a Copenhagener, I feel a bit embarrassed
Copenhagen really does get much more attention and money than the rest of the country, and it’s a shame
I could think of hundreds of places that would need it more
Interesting
As a Copenhagener, I’m trying to understand what people don’t like about it
Probably that it's too close to Sweden
Too big
Too many people
Gets too much attention compared to other cities
People from there tend to, in my experience, act like they're better than everyone else
As a person from Jylland living in Copenhagen, the last part rings so true
I've met more Copenhageners than I care to admit who are proud of having never been to any part of Denmark outside sjælland because "there's no need to" and who really look down on the rest of the country like they are a bunch of backwards hillbillies
It’s sad that you have that experience with people acting like they’re better than others
I’m a little embarrassed by the fact that it gets so much attention and money
I feel like there’s hundreds of places that needs it way more
Regarding there being too many people, I think that can depend on where you go in the city
I avoid the centre like the plague and mostly spend my time in just my neighbourhood, which is only just being built up, so there aren't too many people out here, yet
Good headphones and a job that's also on the outskirts or not right next to Nørreport help, too
Yep, it's sad, but it's happened pretty consistently, especially when they learn I'm from Jutland
English: very much taken for granted and I’ve met extremely few people who don’t speak it
All other languages are optional
German or French conversational level is more common among older generations
In Denmark everybody speak English
We are also taught German and French (and may choose more languages) but few are fluent
My 16 year old is fluent in English
English is considered common and i have yet to see an adult, who cannot speak English, tho i have noticed a trend of older people speaking with a very British English accent, and younger people leaning more to American, wich is probably due to more exposure to American through the internet, German or French is a 50/50
Understanding english is highly exoected from most Danes, since we get english education in school
It's expected to atleast know English here, and quite a few manage passable German
So it was a chock to me; when I sent a meme to a woman I have been chatting with for at while, and she asked me to translate
I got into a bit of a heated discussion about this with my mother once
She has never lived in Denmark and knows next to nothing about daily life here
She was trying to convince me that because I speak English and had completed a Bachelor's degree, I must be in the top tier for in-demand jobs
I tried to explain to her that that was the extreme *bare minimum* for a lot of jobs, at least in the field I wanted to get into, which was why I was taking my Master's at the time
If you only had a Bachelor's, you would definitely have to make up for it with experience and being fluent in English would impress no one
She kept insisting that my English proficiency alone should basically qualify me for a managerial position and I kept trying to tell her that *everyone* speaks English, is expected to speak English, and I'm not special
It’s also a bit of a shock for foreigners moving here
A lot of them have a naive view that knowing English will make them attractive on the job market
Nope, you’re competing with Danes who are fluent in Danish *and* English
That's close to the thinking she had, that the workforce is full of monolingual Danes I could one-up
Yeah, not so much
English is absolutely taken for granted, here, at all levels
It's not just executives and managers at international firms who are expected to know English, "even" basic-level retail and "blue-collar" jobs often require people to have at least some knowledge of English
And people do
In the USA
Ha, if you speak English with that Irish accent; everyone will love you here
Family and the closest friends can help themselves to anything they want - but it is of course polite to ask first
Anyone else - no, would never happen
Norway: I have admittedly never been there, but their national day, the 17th of May
I wish we had a national day that we actually celebrated, and a cool national dress
Sweden: Sweden’s wooden houses look super cute
All of our houses are bricks
Every Swedish person I've known has always been really, really nice
Incredibly helpful, friendly, and kind
There doesn't seem to be as much posturing or as many inflated egos on the other side of the bridge
When I was in **Sweden** last time, one thing I really liked was how their cafés operated and how huge of a culture they seemed to have around just hanging out there
Also, they are more progressive than we are, which is generally positive but can be negative at times
**Norwegians** are so much it almost hurts
For me they are basically the Canada of Scandinavia
Such a nice and open people, I absolutely adore them (heck, for a while I actively sought out Norwegians guys when dating)
Also the make great TV and have a awesome youth culture
I also want to go on your version of Rus, it looks so much more fun than ours
**Germany** deserves mad respect for how the evolved as a country post-WW2
They are the prime example of owning up to your mistakes and actively trying to be better for it
Also, they are such a humble and hard-working people
I work closely with Germans and even lived there for a while and they are always a delight
Also, German has a movie industry on par with the US or UK
I'd say that at least 3 out of my top 10 best movies of all time are German
Germany, I really like your food
When we were in Czechia this summer we had a recouring problem where we only got a relatively small plate of food everytime we went out to eat
(Except for that it’s an amazing country
) Being only three guys we were often left semi-hungry
On our way back we were driving through Germany and stopped in a small town diner and ordered the best you can get, wienerschnitzel with mushroom gravy
We were sitting with a big beer and the waiter comes with three HUGE servings, probably too big, and to make up for our experience in Czechia of course we had to eat every single particle of food on our plates
We hadn’t been so full in two weeks
So they know how to feed a man, and I always have to get a schnietzel or currywurst when I’m in Germany
Wait a minute
Don't think of it as oppression
Think of it as creating a tight bond between the peoples of our nations through many years of *national cooperation***.**
I always forget about them
I like their cheap bakeries everywhere
Thanks
Love the way you guys pronounce it "Sjøpenhaavn"
We like them for the cheap soda, beer and candy you buy at the borders hops
Rasmus Paludan
We'd be better off without that cunt
Donald Trump
ban him from the entire Kingdom of Denmark, so he could never set foot in Greenland either
Likely Rasmus Paludan - let him get a taste of his own medicine
Rasmus Paludan
Or big arse racist
Well, the ban can come after he has served his second three month prison sentance
Of what I know
It’s probably peter Madsen
Although I’m sure there are worse criminals
If I could ban all pedophiles and murderers I would be happy
Or at least people that don’t regret their decisions
But since it’s only one person I guess peter Madsen, or whoever you s the worst and most despicable criminal in Denmark
For politics I don’t actually know
Probably the Leader of Nordfront in Denmark or the Leader of hizb-ut-tahrir in Denmark
I Think Kasem Said Ahmad would be a better idea
I would be fine with soros here
I'm fairly sure that he knew about us at some point, but it is of course likely that he have forgotten us
One can only hope
Of course, but I don't think he knows about them yet
There's always going to be valid arguments for other candidates, but Paludan for me is a dangerous man to have in our society
Very saying though, that I suggest a well-known Islamophobe and your reaction is to suggest the spokesperson for Islamisk trossamfund
The man has been thrown out of EL for his extremely hard opinion on women this man his more dangerous
He was also member of the delegation that travelled around the Middle East to bash on Denmark
Then he's your pick
Mine is still Paludan
Yes
There's a verified names list, and if your newborn's name isn't on there, I'd imagine it usually isn't a difficult process verifying a new one
Every year some news media will always make a short article about ridiculous new names that made it to the list that year
I recall "dreng" being one of those names a few years back
It literally means "boy", and that might not sound too uncommon for English nations, but it doesn't make sense in Danish
The whole list came about when a couple tried naming their kid "Anus" if I recall correctly
When did this list get introduced
As I recall, laws for naming your children got liberalised in the 00's. Has that been reverted
I’m disappointed that the Kobold isn’t a tiny dragon person :(
Moesgaard Museum in my home town of Aarhus is legit the best archaeological museum in the world
Outstanding exhibitions and also some pretty unique findings
In Denmark there are two that comes to my mind, The National Museum in Copenhagen or Moesgård outside of Århus
As for "traditional" museums (i.e. lots of glass cases and information panels), the National Museum is probably the best, and certainly the largest
As for "modern" museums, it's probably either Moesgaard (as has been mentioned several times by other posters) or the M/S Maritime Museum in Helsingør (which curiously hasn't been mentioned)
Both are big, new and fancy, but don't let being "new and fancy" compromise too much with being interesting and informative
Moesgaard is a fantastic museum
There are great historical museums in Copenhagen too, but the exhibitions at Moesgaard are very well designed
Overwhelming and informative at the same time
The museum just dragged me in
I've never experienced that before at a museum
Moesgaard is number one for me too, but If I should choose one in Copenhagen (where I'm from), it would be Glyptoteket because it is such a beautiful place
Moresgaard is amazing
In terms of fine art Aros is good, but Louisiana and SMK are the best IMO
In the fine art sphere, I love Hamburger Bahnhof - amazing museum
Denmark has some pretty dank local museums
We have one of the strongest local archaeological traditions in the world, and it really shows
I really believe Aarhus is punching above its weight in Museums
I dunno if you had time to visit Aros and Den Gamle By while you were here, but they are both quite world class as well, although I'm not tha tmuch into art
Its definitely the style of the exhibitions that really sell it in Moesgaard, the design is really well made
The new Freedom Museum in Copenhagen about the WW2 Occupation is also quite good, but its subject matter is a bit limited of course
Glyptoteket is an absolutely fantastic building and they have som nice pieces
As a museum, though, it's pretty boring
At least the permanent exhibition
It's just "Roman dude 1", "Roman Dude 2", "Rich Roman Dude", "Rich Egyptian" etc
I once spend an entire monday at the Teylers instead of going to uni
One of the things I enjoyed the most was figuring out how certain instruments worked
And being invited to eat strawberry cake a staff member brought to work
It came with a nice behind-the-scenes tour
I suspect it wasn't one of their busiest days ;-)
Does the Netherlands have any good museums related to the VOC / colonial history
I was there like eight years ago but only really saw the Rijksmuseum but I'm curious if there is more
This summer I went to Ribes new museum of Witches and Witchcraft - that one was dope as hell
Super modern and interactive
My parents would speak English to each other when they were trying to hide something from me and my siblings
I guess it worked out great, because both my sister and I became fluent at age 13-14
After we learned what they were talking about they switched over to German, which neither my sister nor myself understood
It was the perfect plan, untill my mom found out that my dad didn't understand a word she was saying
We're all native Danes, but have languages taught to us in school
My parents switched to English when they were arguing before I could understand it
Yes, we typically speak English
But then we went to Bali for a couple of months and we (the parents) only spoke English to other people, so the kids caught up and soon understood everything
In Denmark: Mom and dad are fluent in English and German
So in the beginning they would use both
Then we kids learned English, and they started talking in German more
Then we kids started learning in German, and now they sort of couldn't.. Well sort off
Becuse both my younger brothers are decent at German
And I. Am NOT
I got no idea what is going on
I can a few words
I could probably order a beer at a resturant
And some how with handgestures make people understand I need a toilet if I was in Germany
But that's it
So my family will now have conversations in German, and I will just be at a loose
I struggle with learning languages and generally learning due to a bad ADHD
So I am behind on stuff like that
The only reason I learned English was because we went to America for 2 years
But is weird seeing my younger brothers being smarter and better than me, in just about everything
my parents used to speak german to my
older siblings when they didn’t want me nor my sister to know what they said
When i was younger they spoke english, then i learned english, then they started speaking german but my dad is really bad at that and now i speak german too
My parents did the same thing, but when I started understanding them, they switched over to German, and that one still works if what they’re talking about is complicated enough
Never annoyed, anyone who tries speaking Danish needs all available encouragement
I'm not at all offended if people just speak English to me, though
I used to teach danish to foreigners, and it was the most common complaint that Danes "refused" to let them try speaking in danish and always just switched to English - no matter how simple the conversation (even "a coffee, please" would get rejected)
That's why I always make a point of letting people try in danish - it's a hard enough language as it is
No need to make it more difficult to learn by minimizing the platform
I do also have the privilege that years of listening to people learn danish, has made me quite good at picking up on what people want to say, rather than what they are actually saying
Hope you weren't forced to say "rødgrød med fløde" for laughs more than 5 times a day
I've recently became very aware of this as i have to homeschool my 6 year old son
It's most of the time yes 'a' sounds like that but it can also sound like a 'e' or like a very flat version of 'a' this is just something you have to remember
and then I'm just wtf is wrong with my native language it's just horrible
I always feel sorry for people trying to learn danish
Yeah, same in Copenhagen
In Denmark we call them "the English ghetto".
Near the coasts: that fresh and salty sea-smell
Copenhagen area: baked goods and sewer
Inland: fertilizer mixed with fresh air
I'm sorry, what
Scratch and *sniff*? What kind of ballsacks are you guys buying
You nailed it
Now hang on where does the sewer come in XD
Does Copenhagen really smell like sewer
I’ve lived both in and out of cph, and though I do agree that there is a certain staleness to the air in the inner city, I wouldn’t go as far as call it sewer like
Edit: BTW I 100% agree with you on everything else, the first thing I thought of was the fresh wind
I think it’s more of an “inner city”-smell tbh, and it’s not there all the time (like the fertilizer-smell inland), but when walking down the street in Copenhagen (or Aarhus/Aalborg for that matter) I find that you sometimes get that unpleasant “sewer-smell” punching its way into your nose
I’m just here to see where I can go and do urbex
That’s sad, small towns are not doing well here either
Does Sweden have a lot of abandonned building
Haven’t been there since I was a kid
That’s cool was gonna go sometime anyways
The thing is, marijuana is really harmless compared to other drugs
It's also way less addictive than smoking and drinking, so if you make sure to only do it on your days off, then it shouldn't be a problem
BUT there is serious side effects if your brain hasn't developed fully yet, like reduced inteligence, so minors should NOT smoke and/or ingest marijuana
Furthermore, it would make the drug more safe for everyone if it was legalized, so all in all, I think it should be legalized, but with an age cap at ATLEAST 21, preferably more
>3) It's less harmful than tobacco and alcohol, which are perfectly legal instead
That depends on how you define less harmful
Cannabis is more likely to permanently damage you cognitive abilities than either of those two others
It lowers people's IQs and damage their memory
I thought England, UK, Great Britain was the same thing and I thought Scotland, Ireland and Wales were places in England
Yes we are
The term is not geographical as much as historical
I completely agree
Merrild kaffe best everyday coffee in Denmark
10 times better then the fox-piss Karat kaffe
They can recycle all they want, but I still won't buy a nestle product ever
British people don't take their shoes off
Non-native speakers often have a hard time distinguishing between the vowels "ø" and "o". The result is that *rovdyr* (predator) is often mispronounced *røvdyr* (ass-animal)
It is pretty funny
I knew a exchange student who would pronounce *kælling* like *killing*. Hard to take it seriously when he tried calling you a bitch, but called you a kitten instead
That makes me think of the queens (French) husband - he was once telling the media how he went fox hunting  and caught a fox
Because ræv (fox) and røv (ass) sounds very similar he accidentally said he caught an ass
nope
never heard about 'millenials' and 'boomers' before encountering americans on the internet
There aren't even danish translations of the words for Gen X, Babyboomer, millenials etc
Nope
Most people I know, don't even know the different generations
Well
Mostly only on 2 subjects
immigration and climate change
Though to be completely honest, when you look at the demographic of how people vote during elections, it seems more like, the people living in the larger cities, want more immigration and a focus on climate change
and the people living out in the rural areas and small towns, want less immigration and don't care about the climate change
but that said, i've not really asked around
that's just the sense i get, when i hear comments from the citizens, in the news, or they talk about a poll etc
Well to be fair, while Americans might be more focused on generations, we do have one generation that comes up from time to time - that being "68'er generationen" (Generation of 68')
It is sometimes  stereotyped as being sort of an entitled generation, which participated in ungdomsoprøret (60's counterculture movement), going on to sit on the top posts in society, and then got more conservative and greedy as the years passed on
Never heard of that
My hometown has a house with a [window] that musn't be closed or the ghost inside with burn down the city
The tale goes as follows: in the 1330s to 1350s or so Denmark had been invaded by the Germans (btw, recommend everybody interested in history to read the history surrounding this, its some GoT shit - literally a battle of kings)
In my hometown (Randers) the German had situated their foothold with around 4000 of their total 11000 men, all led by a German count called Gert
Count Gert faced a rebellion from local former knights and squires, one of them a squire called [Niels Ebbesen] One night Ebbesen's men (47 in total) burned some barns around the city, drawing the counts men out the city gates to check the situation
While the men were out, Ebbesens himself dressed as a farmer and snuck into the city and into the home of the count
Here he beheaded the count in his bed, who now haunts the building (there are some factual difficulties here, as the building with the window was built around 300 years later and the old building burned down, but still)
Apparently the window has been closed three times in total since the building was made, and every time the building has caught on fire and caused a lot of damage in the area by the fire spreading
There's also an additional legend that says that the German men who followed Ebbesen and his men as they fled the city, haunt a local bridge
The Danish knights had loosened the bridge and as the Germans rode over it, they pulled the bridge so the German men fell into the river Gudenåen, and drowned
They now haunt this bridge and will pull people into it to get revenge on Danes
Of course, much like with the building, [the original bridge] doesn't exist anymore, though it has been replaced with a [blue metal one] instead
Plus there's really no evidence that the German men actually died on the bridge at all
There is this statue in Helsingør. It’s a statue of Holger Danske
It’s a “haunted” statue which according to the legend, comes to life if Denmark is in war
The ‘Stuff You Missed In History Class’ podcast have made an episode about this called “The Allegedly Haunted Island  of Poveglia”. It’s a good listen
Firstly, the statue is not in Copenhagen but in Castle Kronborg which is in Elsinore (Helsingør)
Secondly, if the myth is true then we now know that it will take more than 6 hours to wake him up, considering that that was the approximate amount of time it took the germans to subjugate us on the 9th of april 1940
Yea, I did no research, thanks for correcting me
You’re welcome
Ingen årsag makker
> Does Danish not have any words that would be offensive in some situations
"Sweden" is considered a very uncultured and vulgar word
We use fuck *very* liberally
As a general population, not really, people doesn’t really find certain words offensive
None of that "before 9 pm" business here
I've heard several "fuck"s and its variants at all times on publicly broadcast radio and tv, even during programmes aimed at kids/teenagers
Can confirm
Wouldn't even use that word about my worst enemy
I think that's because it doesn't mean as much as it's a foreign word and therefore not as 'potent' - it's been very well adapted and adopted, but it's still not as ingrained, so, therefore, doesn't carry the same weight
And in a lot of cases, if you do find them offensive, you'll be told you can't take a joke, or that it wasn't that serious/they didn't mean it that way and why are you spoiling all the 'fun'?
Ø (island), å (a small-ass river), i (in) and I (plural you)
I (2nd person plural)
I (in)
Ø (island)
Å (stream, small lake)
Ø, which is an ø
Å = stream/flood
Ø = Island
Ø - Island
Å - A smaller river
We don't have any big enough to qualify for an actual river
Those are called "floder" in Danish
I - You(plural)
i - In/inside
I may have missed some
We have "ø" which is the danish word for island
"I" is "you" in pluralis (must be a capital i)
"I" and "i" is "in"
"Å" is "stream" as in a creek
"Ø" is "island"
Move to southern Jutland and every single word is just single vowels
Ø meaning island
Ø = Island
Å = Creek
Quite a few more if you find the right vestjyde or sønderjyde as well
"A æ u å æ ø i æ å" = I'm on an island in a creek
My godparents speak like that and it's great
Greenlandic: hold my igloo
Danish is one of the languages with the highest amount of vowels (and sounds in general, but especially vowels) in the world
I find consonants much harder to learn to pronounce in other languages and harsher on my throat
If you're actually curious, I can find a video real quick :)
Edit:  she says it around 3 seconds
is roughly correct timestamp she also says the sentence in rigsdansk afterwards
And it's just a feature of the language
IIRC we have the most vowel sounds of any language in the world, though not the highest amount of sounds
It is harder but no not that much harder
We’re by far the ones that gets the most language hate among Nordics
Yes, I don't understand 90% of what my swedish friend says in swedish, but on text it's pretty similar tbh
It's edited into my previous comment now
Not rude, but many people won't tell you if they ask
Personally I don't care
My salary is public information anyways since I am employed as a researcher at a University
What's Belarus like
I hear some frightening stories from there
And there are also those who just walk on their own, in Copenhagen
Absolutly not Denmark
We drink like holes in the ground
It's weird and convoluted, the grammar and spelling is completely different but if you read it aloud you can understand pretty ok
“Can I borrow the toilet
Also, eventuelt means alternatively, but is sometimes spoken as eventually
Privatøkonomi, personal finance, becomes private economy
“Let’s get concrete”, and “Concretely I mean
” because konkret means specific
Danes tend to overuse "that" in sentences
Often instead of "which" or at other times as a completely redundant word
Actual does mean current tho
I once knew a guy almost always insisted on pronouncing the silent letters in English
Couldn't convince him that knight wasn't pronounced knait (now I wonder why he didn't also claim it'd be knai**g**t), that knee wasn't pronounced knii or that sword wasn't svord (like with a v not as with a w)
Interesting if you search 'actual definition' on google, one of the definitions is that actual can mean current, with a source of the oxford dictionary, but the oxford dictionary explicitly says that this is not correct
He says kaniggit though
I was flying home from Hanoi, and because of a sudden change in tickets, I was now going over Moscow
As I then found out, the woman in the next seat was not only also Danish, but her grandfather had been my English teacher in school
No unfortunately not
If you've got no passport or driver's license you can apply to get something that's halfway it
In Denmark, either your drivers license or your healthcare(?) card is mainly considered your ID
We don’t. We have a health insurance card which is sometimes acceptable, but it has no photo
This contains your sUpEr SeCrEt personal number
But if you know the persons gender and birthday there are only 500 combinations
The famous musician Kim Larsen named an album his personal number as a joke
Other than driver's license or passport, the closest in Denmark would be the  ["sundhedskort"] (health card) (formerly "sygesikringskort" (health insurance card)) which states the person's full name, address, CPR number (literally Central Person Register), the person's doctor's name and address as well as municipality and region of residence
In denmark we use this Things called NemID
It’s just  [some paper thing] you get
It’s a kind of ID “code” you get
To identify yourself in public, we have our [drivers license] and [health insurance]
We have a "Health card" with name, address, cpr-number (central person registration-number
Everybody has a unique number from birth) and name of doctor
It does not have a picture on it
We use it when going to the doctor's or hospital or other health-related places
It can also be used as ID for example if you are picking up a package from the postoffice
Denmark doesn’t issue an official ID card that you can use internationally, however the counties/communes issue an ID card that can be used for purchase of alcohol or other stuff
Which you can get at the age of 15, as you can be hold criminally accountable (at adult levels) at the age of 15
Another thing you can use it for, previously stated, purchase of alcohol, which you can do at age 16
This is only usable in Denmark, as far as my knowledge go
You could argue that our social security cards count as IDs, as they contain our social security number
You can't use them as ID anywhere and they don't fit the EU/eea standards for id cards
You can use them in conjunction with a student card
Some places
But it's not a valid national ID, e.g. It can't be used as id for travel in the Shengen area
A true national ID can be used to board planes and other places instead of a passport in Shengen
Without research I think I can comfortably say Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Copenhagen
Interestingly, the second largest for much of the 1800s was Charlotte Amalie - on St
Thomas in the Caribbean
Actually I think, Malmø might've been more populated than Copenhagen at some point during the 16th century
English is so prevalent in society that you can't help being a little familiar with English before actual English classes
My generation was almost exclusively taught British English in school yet when we speak it's evident we got our spoken English from movies, cartoons, music, games, not from our teachers
I started learning English in the 3rd grade
(I think that would be 10 or 11 years old)
About a year and a half later I felt confident enough in my English skills to watch youtube videos in English
Things really picked up from there
A couple months later, I was speaking English so much that my friends made a rule saying I wasn't allowed to other than during English class
Started as a 9 y/o in school
I was slightly under average
At 14-15 y/o I started playing with and talking to people from other countries (namely The UK, The Netherlands & Norway)
That is when my English improved significantly
I also really began watching YouTube videos and streaming movies in English
What worked for me was not the many schemes of bending words in school
Actively using the language made me want to not make too obvious grammatical mistakes
Hearing people talk/reading what people write was also a great way to learn the language’s construction better
When I was 7 or 8 I started learning it in school, I believe you start learning it at 5 years old now though
I improved by playing video games, such as CSGO and Fifa
It's uncommon not to speak English in Denmark too, since we learn from such an early age
I learned in already 5th grade already
children in Denmark learn English from first grade now
Danish is such an uncommon language that foreign languages are taught from a very early age
Besides, unlike some of the big European countries,movies and books aren’t all translated to our native language, so we learn it through different media
I started learning english by watching videos
I used to watch english youtubers and watch the video with subtitles then when it's done I watched it again without subtitles and tried remembering the words
But my grammar is not as good as my english
I haven't actually heard of anyone doing it, but on my schools FAQ about exchange programs, there is a section about doing exchanges to other Danish universities
Even another university in the same city
I have stereotypes of how they all look in my head, and it’s pretty distinct (I.e more olive skin, green eyes and curls for South, that dark almost black hair colour and brown eyes for East) but in reality I probably wouldn’t.
I'd say through a combination of clothes, hair and some facial features, I can often make an educated guess
I grew up in a very international enviroment, and a common phrase we've heard growing up is people going "oh yeah I see that" when someone mentions which country they are from
I've certainly more than once recognised Brits, Germans and Scandinavians when travelling
Dutch, Russian and Polish I can usually also catch
Its usually things like a slight difference in underlying skin tones, eyes or height, combined with fashion/style
Brits, for example, have this haircut that I immediately associate with only them
They also tend to have thinner/smaller mouths and a faceshape that I generally don't see outside the UK
Germans seem to have a very particular fashion sense (not judging whether its good or not, but it certainly isn't like what we wear in Denmark, but I'm sure it's fashionable in Germany, as I see their celebs wearing it as well)
As well as their eye shape and placement sometimes being a little different than the rest of Europe
With the other nationalities I could also say small things like that, which would make me assume they were from those countries
That being said, all of these are stereotypes and loads of people from these countries don't look like that
Nationalities don't really equal ethnicities, and as other have mentioned, we've been banging across country borders for ages in Europe
Now that you mention it, they do really love digging holes on the beach
Whats up with that
I haven't been able to find a proper picture of it, since most of the ones I have is of my old British classmates and I don't feel comfortable sharing those, but it's sort of like [this] but less styled and professional looking
Also what I like to call the "ceasar hair" also seems more common in the UK than I've seen anywhere else
Mind you, I'm a danish women living in Denmark atm, and don't really follow UK mens hair fashion, so it mostly based on the hair I see on tourists or my UK friends when I lived there
I mean it seems quite practical to me, so it makes sense that it's popular is you can't bothered to do too much grooming
Buy secondhand whenever possible and buy quality instead of cheap, easy breakable things
In Denmark we have "there is no cow on the ice" (der er ingen ko på isen) which roughly means "there is no problem".
"Theres no cow on the ice" translates to "there's no problems" in Denmark
I don't know if they are unique to my country alone, as us Scandinavian languages are quite similar in some ways, but here are some
* "Det sætter mit pis i kog" ( It boils my piss) - something that just pisses you straight off, but just mentioned it
* "Gå agurk" ( Go cucumber) - Go amok
* "Der er ugler i mosen" ( there is owls in the bog) - means when something is suspicious or suspicious things are happening
* " Fra børn og fulde folk skal man høre sandheden" (from kids and drunk folks, will always tell you the truth) - It means adults never tell you the whole truth
* "At kaste perler for svin" ( To throw pearls at swine) - Means when your or others, smart/good advice(s) aren't appreciated
* " Ingen ko på isen" (no cow on the ice) - no danger
Now to my favourites
* "Pis mig i øret" (piss me in my ear) - either used when something is annoyed or a "polite" way to tell someone to fuck right off
* "Så er den ged barberet" ( now that goat is shaved) - Means that you finished/complete a task
* " Hvad du ikke ved af, har du ikke ondt af " (what you don't know you can't feel bad about) - "Just read the translation"
* " Saml appetit ude, spis hjemme" (look at others, but eat your wife/husband) - you are welcome to be horny for others, but only fuck your wife/husband
* " At falde er ingen skam, men at blive liggende er" (to fall is no shame, but stay laying is) - No shame is failures, but not trying/giving up, is great shame
* " Hellere styr på lortet end lort på styret" (rather have control on your/the shit, then shit on the controlled) - It means that you should rather know your/the shitshow, then let the shitshow get out of control
I have a lot more if people wants
"få røven på komedie" "get your ass on comedy" it means your in trouble
Dumb women in my country is called a broom
I also have another
Klap lige Hesten (pet the horse) which means come on
In Denmark its “Lad være med at gøre en myg til en elefant”.
We use mosquito to elephant as well
Im fairly certain that moss/mosse (norwegian/danish) translates to 'bog'
I'm pretty sure "grytor" is supposed to be translated to "pots" not "stews" - because pots have handles ("ears"), while stews only have ears if you add ears to your stew
Exactly the same in Denmark
We do
That's the role of Dansk Sprognævn
They constantly update and add words to an official dictionary which is required by law to be followed by schools and government institutions
They don't really ensure stability or really decide much of anything though
They just look at how the language is being used and alter the definitions and spellings to reflect that
They're descriptivist not prescriptivist mostly
I realise most people don't care or know anything about Africa, but it's still beyond me, how people don't acknowledge the fact that the African continent has the most French-speakers in the world
That's true, but it serves as an important lingua franca between the ethnic groups nonetheless, and the number of speakers is only prospected to increase over the years
My comment was mostly to the original question, that people think French was only spoken in France
Idk if Denmark is known for it’s beaches or not, but if you ever visit
Then make sure to visit Skagen in Denmark
Or the entire west coast of Denmark (Don’t let them fool you tho
They can kill)
Very beautiful beaches
Not sure if this is well-known but Copenhagen is recognized as the best city in the world for swimming
I'm probably dating myself here, but bands like [Kashmir] [Dizzy Mizz Lizz] and [Nephew] are the ones I like the best when it comes to Danish music
[Ukendt Kunstner] does a very good job at combining rap and beautiful instrumentals
I also like the singer’s newer, more chill and slow stuff as [Hans Philip]
D-A-D were great
And Carpark North are also great
From Finland I would recommend Korpiklaani, a Finish folk-metal band
I don't think there are two clear ones
I think some cities have rivalries with other nearby cities (like my hometown is the closes big city to Aarhus and we have a rivalry), but I don't think its as serious and Manchester/Liverpool, nor do I think people outside the area are much aware of it
And in my expirence it's like that with all the town rivalries
For Denmark, definetly Copenhagen and Brøndby (The latter being a suburb of the former) and mostly because of football
When they play against each other, you know there will be riots in the streets
Copenhagen vs Aarhus or more accurately, the island of Sjælland (Zealand) vs the peninsula of Jylland (Jutland)
Both regions have equal population sizes, and have historically always been rivals
Denmark vs copenhagen
Snobbish cunts haha (am joking)
As a Jyde who lived in Copenhagen and the surrounding area for about 8 years, I don't disagree  with love of course, but damn I've met some snobbish cunts
Not even a week ago a Copenhagener on reddit insulted me for not thinking Copenhagen is the best place to go out in Denmark
Im from north jutland and some 10 years ago i spent a few years in cph (søborg) - fuck that, people were all “ah, så du er en bonderøv”. Dude, i would rather go out in aalborg than get paid to go out in cph
Just sayin’
Yup
I'm from Randers, so you can imagine the 'jokes' (see: genuine prejudices that people disguised as jokes)
The amount of times I've had both friends and strangers tell me they were surprised I wasn't violent, aggressive, a slut, poor, unintelligent, uncultured
It's verges on at least once a week for all 8 years, if corona hadn't ruined the average
And it certainly wasn't helped by the fact that I never seemed to ever get rid of my accent (thankfully, tbh)
I got so much shit for being from Jylland while living there, it's honestly what drove me to move away from Cph again
It's working
I don't think that's a thing in Danish
Only thing I recall is when a character has an odd accent compared to the rest of the characters
In Danish they would pick the dialect Sønderjysk or Bornholmsk and sometimes Vendelbomål
So many people don't understand the difference between dialects and accents
It's not a dialect because you pronounce something different
Almost Every Region/Island has it's own Dialect
In a country as small as Denmark, we have somewhat distinctive dialects from each part of the country, though definitely not from village to village as you describe it
Basically, Jutland is divided into 3 different dialects - west, north/east and then south
West, south and central Zealand has its own distinctive dialect as well (in the northeastern part, its really just standard danish)
Funen has its own distinctive dialect as well
Lolland and Falster has the same dialect
Bornholm has a very distinctive dialect as well, which sounds almost swedish in their pronounciations
Finally, Copenhagen has its own dialect too
However, most are dying out, as most people by now are just talking slight variations of standard danish
Just wait until you hear about Denmark, we have dialects that some of us can't even understand
We are about the size of the Netherlands, but have a population less than Saint-Petersburg
Had
They are all pretty much dead now and the variation consist of regional pronunciations of Rigsdansk (Standard Danish)
This variation is NOT the same as dialect (which includes regional grammar and vocabulary)
In my experience only old people in the countryside speak actual dialect
Maybe to a certain degree Sønderjylland (South Jutland) is an exception to this
I guess you have never heard of Thyborøn?
I agree that the dialects are dying, but not quite dead yet
I guess you're right on this
though bornholm also has a dialect that is slowly dying
They are actually closer to Old Danish than our current modern variant, so if anything, they would be able to claim to be Danish
Doesn't mean we don't make fun of it
No I am referring to the deep south of Jutland and some parts of northern Jutland too
They speak something that is not easily understandable by people speaking modern, common Danish
I have and you might be right
Not much of a survival rate :P,  but the westcoast fishertowns might be places were dialects a somewhat alive
There's a clear definition of what's a dialect
It gets a bit more fuzzy when it comes to languages, though
I've heard someone simplifying it more or less like this: A dialect with a region and an army is a language
Using written language as a determining factor for whether or not something is a dialect is bad linguistics, if anything, that might be the least important aspect
What makes something a different dialect would have more to do with the vocabulary, grammar, and accent (although yes, a different accent is not enough to make it a dialect from my understanding of it, either, maybe unless it's so different it starts making it hard to understand for others
Being strict with alcohol like the rest of the Nordics
We’re
*certainly* not
people constantly talk about sweden as this socialist haven
but sitting here in Denmark, sweden is terrible in almost every aspect
they also earn less money than us, on avg
Well, it was first defined by Aksel Sandemose, a Danish writer, but he didn't come up with it, he described an existing small-town mentality
I mean the state owned liquor stores, drinking ages being 20 etc
Also they have age limits for when you can drink, laws about public intoxication and laws about public drinking
There exist no drinking age in neither Denmark or Norway .
This is what op referred to
No, the exact opposite
You guys are 18 for light stuff like beer and 20 for hard liquor (buying), we’re 16 for light stuff and 18 for hard liquor
And making people show ID is not taken seriously at all, saying this as a supermarket cashier
Well yeah, I know
Still crazy to me as here it’s sixteen (to buy)
No, normal supermarkets will sell the cheapest beers at around 3 kr
, which is 0
40 €. It's a bit cheaper than a bottle of water
Compare to Norway where they are more like 2 €. You can get a cheap bottle of booze for around 8 €. Relative to the normal cost of goods, alcohol is really cheap in Denmark
Slight correction: that's the ages at which you can legally *buy* alcohol
There's no legal age for consuming
I love the fact that “alcohol dealers” exist
I remember they used one in Skam
And if you’re 14 and therefore can’t, stores don’t really care anyway
Especially not small kiosks
I’m 16 and get asked for my ID maybe one out of 10 times I buy something
That it be it stuff for 16 year olds or 18 year olds
There are a few, mainly people at harbours selling cheap beer from Germany
But it's basically not a thing
I'm not at all sure if you have it in other countries, but "hjemkunstskab" or cooking in English
There's not really an English name for it, but if you were to put that into translate it would probably come out something like "home arts". But it's basically where you learn how to cook, clean, and take care of a kitchen
We had it through 4-6th grade I think
Not sure

Denmark has it as well
We have the mandatory cooking classes too, also in grade 7
The pic you sent looks exactly like the setup when I had it

Latin is mandatory for standard Gymnasiums here and you can choose Greek
Did you go to a public school
I dont remember any of these
We have hjemkundsskab too
I always thought it was about just cooking, but in hindsight I remember there being washing machines too

Must be an autonomy thing as i finished school around 14 years ago and honestly dont remember any of these
As well as Helsingør-Helsingborg I guess
Especially if the bridge will be built
Helsingør & Helsingborg really do feel like one city to me
Taking the ferry across honestly doesn't feel much different than taking a bus from one end to the other of a city
A really expensive bus
Surprisingly cheap actually
Always thought it was expensive cause I'd only ever crossed with a car
But last summer I took it on foot on the way back, and it was only something like 35 kroner
So honestly not much different from a bus
Well the war following the Stockholm bloodbath is in Sweden called something like "The Swedish Indepence War" or "The Swedish Freedom War", while in Denmark it is just called "The Danish-Swedish War" or something similar
Feel free to correct me if I am wrong
When i visited Vietnam, they obviously had a completely different view towards Americans & The Vietnam War than what I’ve gotten from western media
Denmark kind of kept Norway as a fiefdom for 600 years or so, and we had the poor taste of calling it a "Union", which it wasn't exactly
I guess the Irish will know what I am talking about
>the Stockholm bloodbath
Also they seem to think of it as a very bad thing and even go so far as to call Christian II for "Kristian Tyrann", when in fact it was the church that ordered the execution of the heretics
Gustav Vasa cleverly used this in a propaganda effort against Denmark to rally support for his cause and to this day they still believe it in Sweden, which is somewhat annoying
That was maybe the least deserved WC win of all time
Not really
Other than the Stockholm bloodbath, I have no idea what other stuff he has done and I probably know more history than the average Dane
Maybe some historians have an opinion about him, but most Danes would not
> Also we still call the king Kristian Tyrann, while I believe you consider him to be a good king
Most consider him to be a disaster of a King
In fact he was so bad, that he was deposed and kept in prison for the rest of his life
Yeah, its believed the propaganda is one of the reasons why many Swedes now thing we call him "Christian den gode" (the Good)
We don't nor have we ever, but it's apparantly a thing they are even now taught in school in Sweden
When taking my masters in Skandinavistik, I had a Swedish professor who off-hand mentioned how we call him Christian den Gode
And he honestly believed it until we (most of us in the room had also studied History at uni, thankfully) were able to tell him its pure propaganda
That's my point
It was the church in form of the Archbishop that orchestrated the thing
Although Christian II had pardoned the nobles and left them unharmed when he captured Stockholm months earlier, he had no choice but to follow the orders of the church in dealing with heretics
Of course, Christian II didn't mind having an excuse to take revenge on the rebellious nobles in Stockholm, and he went about it very "enthusiastic" so to speak
Yes, even though everybody will say it's just a meme, it really feels like Swedes take the old propaganda literally and continues to hold it against us to this day
That is exactly what I mean
You left out this part:
>All these people had previously been marked down on Archbishop Trolle's proscription list
The following day, 9 November, a council, headed by Archbishop Trolle, sentenced the proscribed to death for being [heretics]
Of course, Christian II most likely didn't mind having an excuse to take revenge on the rebellious nobles in Stockholm, even after they anointed him king, but it is after all the church you should blame
Really
Never heard of it as a meme - only ever ran into it, due to first reading about it in a museum in Stockholm, and then later when I was taking my masters in History we were taught about how they are told this in Sweden (and then of course the before mentioned incident)
It's certainly enough of a thing, even if it as a meme, that [Danmarkshistorien
dk] covers [it
] No matter what, it's ridiculous propaganda to even try and spread
Why would we call him the good
He was removed as king in 1523, shortly after the bloodbath
If he was disliked enough to be removed as king, then why call him the good
Makes no sense
Sure, like anyone with power in the church did at that time
We sincerely apologise on his behalf, so now you can return Scania, Halland and Blekinge to us, which are currently in Sweden
They have been punished enough already, wouldn't you say
As a Dane, I don't have any problem with the Swedish or Norwegian
The German and Dutch is pretty difficult
I can understand a little bit but not much
English isn't difficult at all because I speak English
If I didn't speak English I could probably understand some of it, but I think it would be like German or Dutch to me
Written Danish and Norwegian (Bokmål) are so identical you won’t always notice that it’s not, in my case, Danish
Swedish is quite understandable but u gotta give it a thought sometimes
German doesn’t have nearly the same amount of words in common
But since I had German in school a few years, I do understand the basics
Dutch
myeh
I can kinda tell what some words mean and guess my way through some sentences
But no
This is where I cannot keep up
English
No way man
Never got that language pinned down
Swedish: most of it
Norwegian: most of it
Danish: All of it
German: A little, can figure out some words that look similar to words from languages I know
Dutch: Very little only a few recognizable words
English: All of it
Low German: Nothing
Bavarian: Nothing
Luxembourgish: Very little, can guess the sentences from some keywords in the sentences
Afrikaans: Very little, same as Luxembourgish
Icelandic: Very very little
Swedish: Just enough to understand the point
Norwegian: 100%, no problem at all
Just like reading Danish
German: Understand every other sentence or so, not as easy as Swedish though
Flemish: Surprisingly enough to understand a little bit, AFAIK first time I'm reading it, but not impossible
I'm parctially fluent in English, and im natively Danish
So all of that, and the nordic languages are all very close
And the other are kinda far away
For me it is only Danish and English, with a little bit of the Norwegian one
Since I am only half danish, and have not been exposed to Scandinavian languages as much as most, I have trouble with understanding Norwegian and Swedish, so that is probably why
&#x200B;
What more confuses me is why are the different languages different articles
The Scandinavian are super short (Danish is the shortest) while ones like German and English are really long articles
Why is it not just a direct translation
Dane here:
Swedish - 100%
Norwegian - 100%
Danish - 100%
[G] - 100 % (But I am almost fluent in German)
[F] - Maybe 80% with a bit of guessing
The text makes sense
English - 100%
Low German - Less than Flemish, maybe 70 %. I can still get the overall meaning of the text
Bavarian - A bit better than Low German (all these ski trips to Austria haven't been without benefit)
Trying to pronounce the text makes it somehow understandable
But reading is takes time
75%
Luxembourgish - The most difficult one so far
50%
Afrikaans - Surprisingly easy, maybe even easier than [F] 85 %
Icelandic - I am embarrassed to say this is hard
40%
all for all of the top, except the Dutch
With the Dutch I understand maybe 85%, though it's slow reading
I understand less Low German and Bavarian than Dutch
Luxembourgish is also a slow read, but I understand most
Afrikaans is less than Luxembourgish, and Icelandic is maybe the same level as Luxembourgish
&#x200B;
I'm Danish though, and work with languages as my job while I study Scandinavistics at university, plus I had 8 years of German in School
So most I know through studying the languages
* Danish: 100 %
* Norwegian: 99 % (written Norwegian is essentially just Danish where the words are spelled closer to their pronunciation, though there may be a word here and there that differs from Danish)
* English: 98 % (there might be a few technical terms where I know the Danish word but not the English one)
* Swedish: 85 % (still very similar to Danish, but not nearly as similar as Norwegian - there were several words I had to decipher from context or plain didn't know)
* German: 40 % (I understand the gist of it, but not much more than that - I took German classes in primary school, but admittedly I forgot most of it, so almost all of my German skills derive from vacations in Germany where I've read restaurant menus, museum signage etc
* Dutch: 10 % (I can recognize several words that are similar to other Germanic languages, but I don't really get any meaning out of reading the article)
I feel like Faroese/Icelandic-speakers get the best deal in terms of Germanic-language comprehension
- Learn Danish/another Scandinavian in school
- Learn English because everybody does
- Faroese/Icelandic are similar, so have a head-start there
- Have a head-start on German grammar what with their own grammatical complexity, while indirectly absorbing much of the vocabulary through English and the Scandinavian languages
I wear "Home clothes" every day
I go outside and wear "outside clothes" but when I am arriving home I change
I shower in the evening so the routine is "come home - no need to go somewhere - shower - home clothes - pyjamas". I also have specific clothes I wear for DIY projects or garden and I always take my shoes off in the hallway near the front door
Needless to say I also have "go outside to the trashcan" or "work in the garden" or "walk around in my house" shoes and that i have a lot of floor mats
Guess i am a bit weird
Still need a denmark tag
I remember I had some old outdoor shoes at my parents house
It was litteraly just my shoes from confirmation that later after years tear became some outdoor working shoes
Sounds like everyone does it here
I do not buy clothes specifically for indoor use
Mange hilsener
Women's trousers (regular ones, not even sweatpants) are notorious for shitty pockets
A popular conspiracy theory as to why, is so that more women buy expensive handbags
I buy men's pyjama bottoms from H&M since they have even shitty pockets
Women's PJ bottoms don't have them at all, and they're basically the same garment
My phone doesn't have a case on it, since I can barely squeeze it into my pocket without one
So there's a bigger chance that it could get smashed
At this point, I'd almost give up my right to vote if only I could get decent pockets
(Not really, braver women and men than me died for that, that would be rude and disrespectful
“Jeg har set en rigtig negermand” literally means “I have seen a real negroman” but it’s an old meme here (Denmark)
In The Netherlands, there is this city called Sevenum
It’s a city with my favorite theme park, toverland
It’s beautiful in there
And I camped at “de schatberg”. It’s such a good place with a lot of nice Dutch people ready to speak English just for you
Budapest
Supposed to go there in Easter but had to postpone it to October

Haha, I love how not even the rich can escape [the curse of ugly Belgian houses
What is it with Belgium and their sense, or lack of sense, of architecture
As others have pointed out we don’t flaunt our wealth the same way in Scandinavia, but parts of Stockholm and Copenhagen is very expensive
“Hambros Allé” is probably the most expensive street (in the Hellerup departement)
The cheapest houses goes for around 3
5mill€ and past the 10mill€ mark
Saw a random Mercedes with Saudi plates in Berlin
Apart from that it’s probably some US plate
I once saw a Russian car, but I've never seen anything from outside of Europe
Only if they are working for the North Korean state of course (looking at you Poland)
It should be spelled "ad" and not "at", since it is a fast way of writing the latin word "ad" (via) just like & is a fast way of writing the latin word "et" (and)
Snabel A, which means trunky A - like the trunk of an elephant
kanelbulle
I like this lol
In danish its also snabel-a
It is here in Denmark, I wouldn’t know what else to call it personally
But in English you just call it “at”, right
We generally suck in winter sports, as winters are usually wet, windy and miserable here
So we usually cheer for Swedes and Norwegians whenever we don't participate or qualify in snow sports
Yes:
Norway in handball
Netherlands second and Sweden third
Netherlands for football, and Sweden second
Important note: I live in NL and have a Dutch family
I would not tell my wife that I secretly cheer for Norway over Netherlands in handball
I just love those damn Norwegians so much
I generally cheer for the smaller nations, and if one of them happens to be one of our brothers Norway, Finland or Iceland that's just even better
But never Sweden
Sweden deserve only the loudest of booing
Yea usually cheer for Iceland, Norway and Finland
After that I cheer for the underdog
Never Sweden tho
Our nations are mortal enemies
List goes Norway-Iceland-Sweden-Germany
Yes, mainly Germany since my family is from Southern Jutland
We cheer when Sweden gets kicked out
Absolutely
If Denmark is out, I cheer for Sweden, Norway and Iceland
Pretty much all of the Nordics
Especially Sweden
If all of the Nordics gets thrown out it’s most likely Germany
Who were you rooting for during the World Cup QF, DEN-CRO
I am painfully aware of that, when I am routinely overtaken by 7-year old girls in pink snowsuits on the Norwegian and Swedish slopes

Living in Spain I discovered that domestic violence is far more normal than in my own country, Denmark

>How amazingly rowdy the London nightlife is
Even in posh little Bath - passed three different brawls walking home from a shift once and was just
wtf
Another time two menacing dudes came into our restaurant just as we closed and started talking shit about everyone trying to start something
England is at once the most polite and the most aggressive country I've been in
That's super late, here we eat dinner around 6pm
Try having dinner at 5-6pm then
Side note: whenever I’ve travelled to Southern Europe I’ve always found it so irritating that I had to wait till 8-9pm to get some dinner
Here, I doubt more than 1/10 would know a decagram is
What about people who go to work early
I work as a truck driver and get up at 4
30 so for me eating at 21 is way to late
That's when I go to bed
I get up at 6, take a shower, and then have breakfast around 6:15ish
I'm flippin' *hungry* when 12:00 rolls around
It's the last "meal"but it's not uncommon to grab a snack later on, but usually not a full meal
It's the last "meal"but it's not uncommon to grab a snack later on, but usually not a full meal
Not really
We're taught the most commonly used ones and I think I've used deca like twice throughout my life
It's not very many units where it makes sense to use deca and even when it makes sense (with grams) we use single grams
No one really uses megametres, even though it technically makes sense, either
An hour to get ready, 45 minutes transport, and I like to be there 10-15 minutes early and shoot the shit with my coworkers before the actual work starts rolling in (and to avoid being late because traffic was a bitch)
> but how often do you discuss distances in thousands of kilometers so megameters will have some logical sense in such a case
Rarely, though my point was that it was a valid as everything else
I could say that the distance between copenhagen and paris is 1Mm
> For earth it is way too big scale
It would also make sense in long distance air travel
You wouldn't say you traveled 5560km london to new york here you might say you traveled 5,5Mm
> On the other side shopping is something people do daily and do you really ask your butcher for 783 grams of meat
Putting aside how extremely rarely people actually go to butchers here, no
We would ask for 250g, 500g, 750g or 1kg
It isn't about what's precise it's about what's usual
I bet you wouldn't order meat by the hectogram either
But you're welcome to come up here and convince the country that people might save a syllable or character by not using "single" grams, I frankly don't give a care
> wait what
where do you get your meat from
OK never mind, imagine buying salami or cheese, you do this thing up there
Same thing, often you can't cut slice up to gram
You buy all of those thing at the supermarket
You don't buy salami or cheese by the the gram either
You buy a piece or a whole of either (or a bag if it's grated cheese)
I bought a 200 gram piece of parmesan the other day
If I needed more than that I would've bought more pieces
So it's not sliced for me specifically
It's rare to go to a butcher here because why would you want to pay some 20% more for the same product you can get at the supermarket
People only really go to butchers if they're rich, old or if they need something special you can't get elsewhere
I mean it is, but in [packets] Do you guys have a dude the supermarket to cut cheese and salami for you
We do in some of the larger and more expensive ones
I'm not entirely sure how it works though and I'm not sure if they have cheese
Until you called it a deli counter I had kind of forgotten they existed as the shops I usually frequent don't have them
I know very little about any of them, but I get the impression that most of them work as tax havens for the 1% of Europe
If that is correct, I don't like them
Otherwise, I mostly find it amazing that they managed to navigate the mess that was europe up untill 1945
What do Italians generally "LARP"? Stuff from back before Italy was a thing
So wars between Venice and Milan or stuff like that
Or are we talking about fantasy type stuff with orcs and shit
I'm curios, as I haven't seen the media mention it yet, how many innocents died from the airstrike
I mean, it was at an airport
The US just 9/11'ed Iraq to kill an Iranian
If Iranian Militias start doing terror in Europe as a response to the US they better stick to American Embassies and Bases or else I’d be pissed off at the European deaths that Trump would be responsible for
> organized an attack on our embassy
The US embassy in Iraq is a goddamn fortress
It's among the most protected locations in the Middle East
The protestors did some property damage to one reception area
They threw some stones
Embassy personnel responded with teargas, before Iraqi military and police forces eventually dispersed the crowd
The protestors were protesting the US killing at least 25 militia fighters, which were killed in retaliation for a rocket attack that killed one US civilian contractor
The US always responds monstrously out of proportion to any suspected attack
It's like stabbing someone in the face with a knife because you suspect they may have looked at you funny
Ok, I'll have to admit - that takes away alot of my outrage
You mean the military leader who was killed as an illegal act of war by the US
Likely in an effort to distract the US populace from the impeachment proceedings of the very guy who ordered the attack
What about him
He was part of the military of a nation which the US is at peace with
The US military killed him
If Danish military forces planted a bomb that killed General [Richard D. Clarke] or another US military leader, or for that matter any US citizen, would you not also consider that an illegal act of war
You may consider him a legitimate target
The emotional part of me doesn't really disagree, as he was clearly not an upstanding citizen
But in terms of international law, this is as much a war crime as Japan attacking Pearl Harbor in peace time was
Not that the US has ever cared much for obeying international law unless it directly benefits them
The Hague conventions of 1899 and 1907, which were used to convict Nazi leaders at the Nuremberg trials, and to the same effect in the Tokyo War Crimes tribunal, which recognized the attack on Pearl Harbor as a war crime, amongst many others
Furthermore, the international community at large agreed back then that a country does not need to have ratified the treaty in order to be bound by it, or punished for violating it
Article III of the convention of 1907 states that hostilities must not commence without explicit warning
What we today call a declaration of war
The contents of the treaties have largely been covered by other treaties which came after them, such as the Geneva conventions, but they are still valid and legally binding documents which most existing nations, including the US, have signed and ratified
The US military struck Iranian military personnel
That is an attack on Iran, as much as killing a US general and his aides would be
And he may have been funding, helping, organizing terrorist groups
He probably did
He's probably the scum of the Earth
The world is probably a better place without him
But no, funding, helping, organizing terrorist groups is not an act of war
Not according to any internationally recognized treaty, anway, which is kind of the only thing we have that reasonably codifies what is and isn't an act of war
Anyway, I should probably stop posting about this now before I waste my entire weekend away on this depressing topic
Hope you have a good one :)
Russia
Fucking Germans
Fucking Swedes, always ruining everything
If not them, Russia or the US
Germany, again
Sweden gets offended by a joke, then crosses Øresund and tries to kill everyone
Honestly
Russia
i mean, the odds are near 0
they are completely out-gunned vs NATO
but they are constantly "poking around" near sweden - and sweden is not part of NATO for some reason
and i would assume that Denmark would consider an invasion of sweden, an invasion of Denmark, more or less
i certainly would
don’t worry, the Danes aren’t wild anymore, we won’t even speak to each other when getting out of our window seat on the bus
I can’t remember the last time I had eye contact with a Dane, they always avoid conflict:)
I wonder what it will take for them to go back to the Viking days
“Some tourist is walking on the bike lane - be prepared to get E.X.E.C.U.T.E.D.”

Don't know if there's a song in particular, but the artist Kim Larsen was top of his game for 50 years, he tried to break through outside Denmark but it didn't work out
A lot of danish rap is pretty dope
My personal nomination would be this: [Jeg vil la' lyset brænde] or maybe [Vågner i natten]
Farlig Fredag with Onani (masturbation)
Toscana dromedar - Jacob Taarnhøj
If I can answer on behalf of another country, [this] parody of [Drank en Drugs] is an absolute banger
Vai Amor by Gilli, its a dope rap track that absolutely blew up in Denmark, but probably won’t get international recognition
That's gotta be Kim Larsen, a legendary muscician who sadly passed away in 2018
If I had to choose the most catchy one it would be [Køb Bananer (Buy Bananas)]
Bannlyst by Gåte
Not from Denmark, its in Norwegian
Rasmus Seebach
He's a danish songwriter, and one of, if not the best at writing love songs
> Der Komissar
> is a fucking jam
Pretty sure there's even an English cover that charted overseas
> I also love Major Tom
> , great piece of 80s New Wave
Mate, both these songs topped the charts in several non-German speaking countries in the 80s.
Yeah, literally everyone in Denmark loves him, and I’m sure the rest of the world would too if they knew the language
I didn't even know Norway had afterski songs (though it makes sense)
I've always only ever known the German afterski songs
Very different type of music, but fun fact: once in a blue moon a dutch artist will have a hit or two in Denmark with songs in Dutch
Lil Kleine had a few, for example
Sure i do
Ill just throw some of the ones i listen to at you
Culo by Gilli
Verden Vender by Gilli
PUB G by Branco
Protokol by Jamaica
Parkour by Jimillian
Gaden by Fouli
Safari by Molo
Skejsen by Molo
Bølgen by Molo
Dedikeret by Molo
I Got some more ill post Them if you like these
If you’re more to a different kind of rap ill find Them just tell me :)
What type of rap would you prefer
I'd say more popular artist right now could be things like Ukendt Kunstner, Siivas, KESI, Gili, Artigeardit and Benny Jamz
Things I grw up with would be artist like Natasja, Bikstok Røgsystem, Jøden, Kasper Spez and Per Vers
Honorable mentions to Den Gale Pose, LOC, Jokeren and Suspekt (because I know people older than be will be annoyed if I didn't mention them)
Yea depends what kinda rap you want
All the really popular artists are pretty much nothing like American rap
However there are some who remind of eminem and the like
Judging from the Wikipedia article, the German version of Der Kommisar was #7 in Australia and it looks as if it did better than the English version did in the US
I don't know enough about non-European skiing culture to say so, but it's certainly an integral part of skiing in Denmark/Austria/Germany
We have been going to ski at least once every year almost my entire life, and we always go afterskiing
In Denmark, we even have [afterskiing themed bars] even though we don't have mountains
[Nope, afterski in Denmark]
Krantenwijk and Dicterbij Je, I believe
Sorry for the shot formatting
Phone you know :)
Not really a specific accent, but he would cut the end off words
I've never heard about it used in Denmark
You're usually either allowed to bring all your notes and references to tests and examns, or you're not allowed to bring anything other than writing tools
So I guess we'd just call it "notes
Svar ark, answer paper or answer sheet
Svar ark is also something the teacher can give out so you can see if your answers were correct
Swedish has a word for it so not really
In Denmark I think it’s because 1) we just don’t do written exams and tests as much as other countries, oral exams are just as common and only start in your teen years anyway, and 2) they would literally throw you out if they caught you cheating
Just not worth it
I don't think that thing has has a name
Of course I have heard of the concept of smuggling something into an exam, but I don't think we have an well established name for a piece of paper smuggled in
Also because we just don’t have as many tests
We have as many oral exams as written tests, and we only start having them when we’re 14 ish, like once a year
Hm, I feel like cheating is just very normalized in a lot of places
Here, there would be guards circling around to see if you’re cheating
If you are, too bad, have to take an entire year over to go to university/youth education
Well cheating could easily cost you your education, so it’s just not worth it
Huh
I’ve literally never heard that
I wouldn’t correlate having a word for it with being more normalized
Yeah
At highschool/gymnasium level, I'm pretty sure  cheating will get you expelled without warning
Not worth it if you're acually interested in the education you're taking
Expelled from the school and, at least at university level, propably also be banned from reapplying at that university in the future
We don't have lockers in Denmark
We have a box in the back corner of the classroom (because we have 1 classroom, we spend all our time in, with exceptions)
So I have a green plastic box with all ny books, that I don't have to bring home for homework
Oh yeah, there is this thin in Denmark where the teachers opens a safe (yes, a real money safe) and tells us to put in our phones
Then they lock it up intil school ends
All because we have to be more "social".... The thing is, we still have our computers
So we don't need lockers, but we can "buy" one
It's just nobody does that, we use our "boxes".
Danish is the same as german
(Millioner, Milliarder, Billioner, Billiarder)
000
000 = 1 million
000
000
000 = 1 milliard
000
000
000
000 = 1 trillion/billion
funny, Danish is the same, Million and Milliard
Sorry, aren't you missing 3 k's?
My school had a tunnel system that lead to a small bunker
There were two entrances in each end of the school
I got to crawl through to the other end, but the part that went out to the bunker was too unsafe
Pretty cool I’d say
The thing that can make any man cry
Legos
We used to be huge, own and rule the north, even England for a while
Then we lost it all and remain a tiny country
We love conflicting pain upon feet
(LEGO)
Why is that tho
I always wondered why Hungary and not Denmark since we made porn legal first
V O D K A  consumption per capita
Vikings apply to Scandinavia too
When I noticed it the first time in another country I was very surprised
I have accidentally made it a habit
In my city, all the city busses have 3 sets of doors
in the rear, the middle and the front, next to the bus driver
people can enter and exit from any door they want (having a ticket is their own responsibility, the driver doesn't sell them - they gotta use an app or the machine next to the middle door)
and USUALLY people who enter or exit next to the driver say thank you, or hello(if entering)
I think a major reason why we don't do it here is because in most busses you enter through one door, near the driver, but exit through another door, far away from the driver
So if you were to thank the driver on disembarking, you'd have to yell up to them, which would be super awkward
A lot of busses have recently introduced entering and exiting from all doors (just let the people getting out through first, god damn
), so you could exit through the driver's door and say thank you on your way out, but it's still not a thing
AT MOST you say hello or smile to the driver when you enter the bus, but again, since you can now enter the bus through the middle or back doors, you never communicate with them, and it would be so, so, weird for a passenger who entered through the door furthest to the back to go all the way up to the front just to say "thank you".
Disclaimer: these are standard Copenhagen practises
Things might be done differently in other parts of the country
Yeah, the driver has a view of all doors for security/technical reasons, but I dunno, it's just odd to shout "Thanks
" as you're leaving the bus with 6 other people at your door, 8 other people are leaving at the other door, and 15 more are entering the bus, taking up most of the driver's concentration
You actually say that
How unfinnish
You need to start puzzling around with your phone, keys, whatever, without saying a thing
That’ll make them move
If I happen to be the last person on the bus at the last stop on the line, I'll say thanks/good night, but when I'm just doing my regular commute, trying to make it to my train, the last thing I'm thinking about is saying thanks to the bus driver: I just want to move along
It rimes i Danish too
Just use the norwegian words
My god our languages are just that similar
I've noticed a lot of american companies (not excluding european, though) doing unacceptable things to make the chinese market happy
my thought to all of it is that it's screwed up
I did read that letter written by the norwegian parlament member, and it describes my less emotionally-charged thoughts quite well
To me, Cyprus and Croatia are pretty cool
Outside of Europe i like New Zealand the most
I think both Australia and New Zealand have pretty nice shapes
We all know that Sweden is a huge dick
Denmark is the load and Norway is the one cell that made it
Yes, you know what they say "you can't choose your neighbors". We just got really unlucky with ours, we are taking one for the team
It’s a disgrace
As is our abandonment of them
When they speak, almost all the time, it takes are VERY long time to get rid of an accent, and they are rarely similar to the native English accents
Writing on the other hand is another ballgame, but it is still possible to notice it sometimes
Yes, most of the time its so very obvious for whom its a second vs native language
Besides danes, germans, swedes and dutch who are so very easy to spot i also noticed a lot of expat kids who study in international school take on an American english accent and its obvious that they are non-native english speakers because you wouldnt find their accent anywhere in USA
If uou really listen you can tell that even the best non-native English speaker struggle a bit to compared to a native english speaker
It is too forced compared with native speakers who just flow
No one speaks German here, so you're in luck :)
When we die in Denmark, we "stiller træskoene" which means: we place our clogs
The only thing we bite, is the sour apple, when we have no options left
can confirm that we do indeed slip out of our clogs / put them away when we die
Our numbering system
Closest relative is France, but we added further layers of encryption
It's a bit as if we looked at what Europe was doing and decided to take the worst ideas available and add some of our own bullshit on top
German puts the 1s before the 10s (three and thirty = 33), that's silly, let's do that
The French use the base-20 system (4x20 2 = 82), that's archaic and awkward, let's do that too
So now we have 82 = 2 and 4x20 - but we don't stop there, time to fuck up the pronunciation and spelling as well so that what we actually say and write is something like "2 and 4s". And when the French say 4x20 12 for 92, we looked at that, and, having admired the sheer disregard for intuitive simplicity, decided to one-up the French again by saying 2 and ½5s (two and half(way from four to) five times twenty)
Tada
Meanwhile in Norway and Sweden 82 is 8 10 2
It gets worse
Imagine you want to say “75”.
That would be “femoghalvfjerds” or “five and half of four (twenties)” with “half of four” meaning 3x20+10 (halfway to the next twenty
The part in the “()” was left out over time, but I remember my grand father still using it
We do actually use the more straight forward numbering like in English, when writing checks
Why this has never caught on I don’t know
At least I always switch to this numbering when speaking to Norwegians or Swedes
Of course though, no Dane really knows any of this until years after they are taught the numbers
While there is a (convoluted) system, it's much easier to just think of as specific words for each group of tens
as a sports shooter and gun enthusiast I have mostly envied the rules in Czechia, Switzerland and to a degree also Austria and Poland
Didn't know guns were popular in Greece
You need to stop talking so much with strangers if you want to be in the "Nordic" club
Isn't Sámi also an official language in Norway, at least up north
When we're tired of talking with you we just drop a syvoghalvfjerds and let the conversation disintegrate from there
Yup, I mean you don’t think of it as a system
You just remember them like you remember any other words
Sure, it's probably only an issue for us when we learn the numbers (little Annika probably gets that 50 is femtio a bit quicker than little Freja gets that 50 is halvtreds) and when we communicate with Scandinavians in Danish
Honestly, I think they just memorise it
Personally I never thought of it as algebra until I went to uni
Which is also why it sort of annoys me when the Swedes and Norwegians make fun of us for it
Like, do you genuinely think of 90 as "Nine tens"? Of course not
According the the official list, it's [Solhverv by Lord Siva] \- which surprised me as that song is a couple of months old by now
There are some others that are quite popular now that's newer, but since Denmark is currently fighting with youtube over copyright issues, none of them are available on YT
Lord Siva is only there because it's live
Never heard og him
The only danish Music i listen to is Rasmus Seebach
In Denmark it's definently Lolland-Falster
Sønderjylland
Its known as the most racist part
Or maybe Bornholm, because it feels completely separates from the rest of us
Jylland/jutland
I'd probably say Bornholm
I love Bornholm a lot, but it's surprisingly different from the rest of Denmark
The capital
Norway and Skåne are the two odd regions
You can come back tho
Just dig a moat or something between you and the rest of Sweden
Just surrender
I'd say Bornholm
The West coast of the Black Sea has always been a crazy ethnic patchwork
Transylvania is big though, and some regions barely have Hungarians, like Alba, Sibiu, Hunedoara and Bistrița-Năsăud counties
Hell, in Maramureș, Ukrainian is almost a more common minority language than Hungarian
It's only really Harghita and Covasna, where Hungarians are the majority
>danish occupied
Skåne was literally the Danish heartland
Danes as a people originate from there
Truth brother, but Sjælland is really weird as well
Ahh, the legendary Vaslui life
Or Sønderjylland
I agree with Bornholm
Geographically far away from the rest of the country, has the most incomprehensible dialect (considered to be a separate language by some people), has a markedly different landscape (cliffs are extremely rare in Denmark, but Bornholm has a high amount of them), and has its own long list of traditions/customs not seen anywhere else in the country
Lolland/Falster is not *that* different from rural parts of, say, Jutland
Først tager i Skåne og nu dette
Admittetly
what if we asked real nice tho
Anywhere outside of Copenhagen, mostly
Legenda nu a traversat granițele, socri mei sunt români, și stiu multe oameni in Danemarca din România, prin urmare stiu despre legenda Vasluiului :)
Wouldn’t that make Copenhagen the odd one out
Nej

Pattersutter is quite popular in Denmark, and i think part of the appeal, is being bad on purpose
I would also like to submit [Vafler]
His songs are great at parties and during festivals, but that's about it
I think it's enjoyable because it's kind of funny
The one that came to mind for me was [Ben by Tessa]
[Kidd - ik lavet penge] I would also say is annoying, even though it became so popular in Denmark, it still annoys me to hear it
The amount of times I've heard the first one at after-ski this February
It was basically played at least once every hour
That man just eating next to him not giving a fuck
Im not sure Tessa is supposed to be bad
there is definitely not the same level of irony
Oh, no, I meant how Pattesutter is supposed to be bad
Tessa is just bad and not fun to listen to
I was actually
That explains so much :)
extremely popular though - even my mum knows her
We have very different ideas on what grown men look like
He's still in braces
We move out quite early compared to many other European countries, but here it’s completely fine for people of all ages to have sleepovers with the opposite sex
Both children and teenagers
The few parents who didn’t allowed it were viewed as irrational helicopter parents
I moved out when I was 18, but could have stayed longer if I wanted to
My big sister moved out when she was 18 too, because she got at job
My little sister moved out when she was 22, my little brother moved out when he was 23
Regarding having your boy/girlfriend sleeping over, my parents didn't have any problems at all
Sometimes my mom even bought condoms for us
We didn't care if other people were in the house, if we wanted to have sex we had it, we'd just be quit
I'm 19, my mom doesn't care one bit if i bring a girl over as long as i don't wake her up
Not quite twenty, but still living with my parents and have my girlfriend over all the time
It's just an unspoken rule that if the door is closed, knock
If music is playing, stay away
In both our families it's pretty much an unspoken agreement, that obviously we have sex, we just don't want to be actually seen during the act
Her mom has walked in on us once, but we all just kind of laughed at it, except for my girlfriend lol
Our son started bringing his girlfriend home for weekends when they were sixteen
I can't imagine they spent *all* the time sleeping at night, but we made sure he was well stocked up on condoms, and had faith in him being a reasonable young man
Other times he'd spend the weekend at her house, and they'd join our and her families when we vacated somewhere interesting (because who wouldn't like a free vacation with your boy/girlfriend
It was completely unnecessary to educate him on sex since schools have a "theme week" every year from (I think) sixth grade about it, but we inquired any way, and got a polite "yeah, I know
Wear a rubber yadda yadda
I have no intention of becoming a teenage dad
As for noise in the night, we made sure to swap rooms when he started showing an interest in girls, and put him in the most remote room in the house
There are two doors between that room and the living room, so if you're even slightly discrete you should be able to have a lot of mutual joy without waking the whole house
Now our daughter has moved into that room, and is enjoying it in equal measure
Edit: The house is 177 M^2 (1905 sq ft)
I also bought my teenagers bigger beds
One shares hers with a boyfriend, and the other shares his with the dog
Well, here parents are more disgusted with people who hit their kids, than with teenagers having sex
Same with my daughter
She just moved out (age 20) but have been bringing boys home for sleepovers all her life
She has always had male friends
When she became older and they were boyfriends, she would have sex with them in the house
They were fairly discrete, but sometimes we could hear a bed make noises
No big deal
Our son (age 17) is away at school but is of course equally welcome to bring home girls (or boys)
I find our danish national anthem, "Der er et yndigt land" (there is a lovely country), to be very beautiful
Don't forget having a bit of Mozart in it adds prestige
In Denmark there are always danish people in the danish households
Only the Norwegian one or is the Danish one also to be seen
I rarely see people in Denmark with a waffle iron
Yes and no
We rarely use the subpar Norwegian model I'm denmark
Here it's a mix of the different kinds, but we don't really think of them as Danish or Norwegian
They are just cheese slicers
I was thinking of the traditional [one with a wire]
It’s very common in Denmark too, but we have our own (superior totally) slicer that uses a metal string instead
Some animals and a few other things have a childish sounding equivalent that you will hear people say
Miavkat = Meow-cat
Vovhund = Woof-dog
Pipfugl = Tweet-bird
Ildebrand = Firey-fire
Futtog = Toot-train
Flyvemaskine = Literally just ''flying machine'' AKA plane
Same in Danish
You asked every single german
the words like paspas, and also you don’t say “and so on” or “etc” you say “Yemek memek” “araba maraba” it’s so funny
> because landlines are often non existant anymore
They're still around
people just don't have landline phones
lots of companies still do
and of course the government etc
You know you want it back baby
Of course
in the Kalmar union everybody is Danish
sorry I haven’t learned Turkish grammar, I just couldn’t think of what that was called
I still think it’s funny to say “araba maraba” even though you probably wouldn’t say that in school/at work, it’s still pretty normal in informal settings
We do what the Germans do, as is tradition
We can technically use "love" as a verb (We love, we have loved etc
), but no one talks that cleanly
The traditional term (not counting euphemisms similar to "make love" and "sleep with") is actually "dyrke sex" which means "(to) practice sex". Though it could technically also mean "grow sex" as "dyrke" can mean either "grow" or "practice" depending on the context
The term is dying out, however, as everybody these days says "have sex", probably due to the influence of American media/pop culture
We either
have it = Har sex
get it = Får sex
> We can technically use "love" as a verb (We love, we have loved etc
), but no one talks that cleanly
Yes, that's more a literary way of putting it
You can also say 'dyrke sex' (Practise/perform/exercise)
Can't *kyn* mean genitals too
It has that meaning in Danish
It's on a lot of food, especially popular on [Franskbrød] [Rugbrød] and also pastries such as [Frøsnapper
I doubt most people even know poppys are used for opiates
You're saying it's possible to high off poppy seeds
I think it's this one:
Fun doc
The majority of Denmark's pastry traditions are heavily influenced from Immigrated Austrian bakers in 1850, so
poppy seeds *everywhere*!
Please tell me how so I don't accidentally do it
So do we
"Agurketid"
Neither Denmark to my knowledge
"Agurk" is Danish for cucumber, but when you put it together with "tid" (time), a random 'e' just jumps in and wants to join
I have no idea what we call pickles in Danish, apparently
This is the third time I'm editing this comment because I had to fact check what I said and it turns out I was wrong both times
All I know is that I call them "syltede agurker" (meaning pickled cucumbers), but maybe we have an actual word for them, maybe we don't, we'll never know
We have something from a children's song called "bakke snagvendt". You don't really talk it, but you can say words in it
You have to word, and then you swap consonant cluster/ vowel cluster from the same place in the word (usually the first consonant cluster)
For an example, to talk backwards in danish is "snakke bagvendt", but it becomes "bakke snagvendt" when you swap the first consonant clusters
You can also do it to compound words, so missetand can become tissemand
It would be nice if Frederik III could've gotten his head out of his ass and realise that we couldn't take the Swedish Empire at its prime, and that going to war without the support of the lords is exactly what his father did during the thirty years war and that went horribly as well
That way we could've kept Skåne
Either prevent the loss in against the Prussians in 1864 or the loss against the Swedes in 1658
I would just change it so that fatass Swedish king and his whole sutpid army went straight through the ice
Would have solved a lot of issues
An alternate history in which England was in the Nordic cultural sphere instead of gravitating towards France would be very interesting
I genuinely have a hard time thinking of all the consequences - probably the Nordics would have continued to be more internationally relevant, but England's importance would have been diminished
Like it or no, the period when the monarchs of England also ruled large chunks of France did increase England's political significance
It gave England leverage on both sides of the strait, and made it a contender in the continental powerplay
A pseudo-Nordic England would probably have been a more marginal figure, more genuinely insular, with the Dover Strait constituting a substantial cultural and linguistic barrier
I think the biggest change would obviously be cultural
English folklore and myth is essentially forgotten today, because the new Norman elites had no interest in preserving it
So much was lost - I think it is telling that Shakespeare, though he wrote plays set in ancient Britain, Denmark, Italy and Scotland, wrote no plays whatsoever set in Anglo-Saxon England, which in the 16th century still constituted roughly half of all English history
I do not think Hardrada could ever have been king of England
Even if he had won at Stamford-bridge, he then would merely have found himself in Harold's stead, meeting the Normans at Hastings, save with an even more impoverished army and far fewer friendly natives
Even had he won, the pattern of England's Danish rulers indicates that the country would probably have been back to Saxon rule within a few decades
We have plenty of viking legends
Like Sigurd Orm-i-Øje, Regnar Lodbrog, Harald Hildetand etc
In denmark and basically all of scandinavia is vikings and we hear it from every one
But we are proud of out old norse forefathers
Aye, I actually never thought about this, but the Knight is our hero archetype
Makes sense thinking about King Arthur etc
Sound like the basis for Pratchett's Nac mac Feegle
Snafflin' coobeasties, an' all
Several of them are believed to be based on actual historical figures
And in their legends are a grain of truth
But the vast majority of it is fiction
There's a lot of magic
Regnar Lodbrog for instance has a lot of accomplishments to his name
But the only thing we're certain of is that there was a powerful viking chieftain named Regnar who laid siege to Paris in 845, and got a huge payment from King Charles the Bald to fuck off
And this same viking is obviously believed to be the father of "Regnar sønnerne" (the sons of Ragnar), who lead the conquest of the Danelaw
In the same sense Harald Hildetand is believed to be based on a king called Harald who ruled Denmark in 754
We don't know how long before that he became King or how long after that he remained
But Harald Hildetand is known for the battle of Bråvalla and that supposedly happened around that time
Did it come to Swedish from that time Charles XII was in exile
Just like how sarma(kåldolmere) came to Scandinavia
Tordenskjold lived like 700 years after the Viking Age had ended though
I can't speak for Swedish history, but Sigurd Snake in the eye is not considered the first King of Denmark
We know of several kings before his real life counterpart King Sigurd/Sigfred
They do indeed
His name actually sounds pretty badass in English: "Thundershield".
I, too, would be interested in a source of information about this story
But still a legend to this day
Det er sgu dyrt
In Denmark I think it was Rema1000 who said they would sell masks for 3,5 dkr which is under 0,5 eur - and then all of the other supermarkets matched that price but its not state regulated
Wish we had this in Denmark
Over here only the cheapest beers are individually priced
But the reusable masks are not as protective
Is this unique to Scotland or in the entire UK
They've brought it down to 3 kr now
Roughly two fifths of a euro
Edit: just remembered Cents exist, the price is 40 cents
a centimer spared, is a cent earned
I don't think most people would even know what it is
No, but France, along with the rest of the Allied powers, sat and twiddled their thumbs as Eastern Europe was carved up between the Nazis and the Soviets
That beer is taxed as an essential food, like in Bavaria
Nature from Switzerland, Canada, USA, Finland
Food from India and Greece
Friendliness from Bali
Mountains of the Netherlands
I’m a huge car enthusiasts and Danish car laws are royally fucked
Give me Sweden’s car laws please
Granted, you get Syria’s 50% unemployment rate
Then you will have a blast at “LEGO House” all the old models, from your childhood is on display there
You already have new Orleans
Dont be greedy
Thank you
It would, it really, really would
And thats exactly why you can’t have nice things, like french Canada
You will destroy that too lmaof
Thank you
We had a motivationel show telling us to plant trees
on the radio yesterday morning, they had a professor in biodiversity on
he said, that planting trees is a decent idea
but they're not gonna be helpful before 80-100 years
small trees do almost nothing
What show is that
What tv channel is it
> small trees do almost nothing
True
but it accomplishes something else
Gives people hope and makes them feel like they are helping change something
Also spreads awareness of the issue and gets people to think about how they reduce their carbon
I thinks it's organised by municipality
Basically:
- A municipality has an area they would like to reforest
- They sign up to the program saying "we would like to reforest this area".
- TV2 hosts a charity show where viewers can donate X amount
- After the show the charity pot is split up someway and is sent to the participating municipalities to help fund their reforestation
-ish
Never heard of it
> makes them feel like they are helping change something
But if it actually doesn't achieve that much, wouldn't it be better to find a crowdfunding project, that actually would, so people not only would feel like they help changing something, but actually *would* change something
right
lets spend our money on hope, rather than something that works "now" :)
he didn't mention anything specific unfortunately
i was annoyed by that as well
if youre serious, you can contact him here
he works for the university of copenhagen
i dont think an individual can do much
we need very large political action
like closing down coal power and such
Agreed, but I don't have all the details for the event so they might have organised an event for people to do just that in relation to the show or at the very least inspired some local communities to do it
Akvavit, snaps and beer
Us Danes love our alcohol, it's rare to see a Dane who don't drink alcohol
Akvavit and snaps is classic, us young people see it as an old people kind of alcohol
Beer is widely consumed
Beer - The modern way of producing beer was created in Denmark
Aquavit - Scandinavian culture right here
Snaps
It tastes like you were in the middle of rimming a monkey and then it farts in your face
Snaps and it tastes awful
We drink it on holidays mostly
I don’t think you can categorize ‘snaps’ and ‘aquavit’ as two different things
Snaps isn’t a special kind of alcohol but the term for taking a shot of aquavit (in Denmark) during the course of a meal
There has obviously come a new term where we use it for spirits that basically aren’t aquavit, but they are
Horincă and palinca - the same as the above, just distilled to a higher alcohol level
Aquavit was first mentioned when the Danish lord of Bergenshus castle wrote a letter to Olav Engelbrektson, the last Roman Catholic Arcbishop of Norway in 1531
Almost exclusively consumed in Scandinavia, as well as a bit in Germany
Aquavit does not taste good, but I do enjoy it for the tradition and tool of bringing people together
> there are whiskies produced on the Scottish islands which still use peat within the malting process,
I think you mean "deliberately" use peat
When you say they "still" use peat, it sounds like it's out of necessity, whereas it's the whole point of Islay whisky, that it has those peaty flavours
I remember sharing a bottle of unicum with a friend on a train to the city
That stuff looks rank when you throw it up
Ah, the modern way of culturing pure yeast was developed in Denmark, but that's about it
Swap the spoon for a coin, and you have the recipe for kaffepunch
Chartreuse has a cult following in my town
The rumours say the French café that popularised it here is the place that sells the most chartreuse in the world
Looks like a health potion
Not sure whether you are making a joke or referring to the spelling hmmm
Which is the foundation of creating beer, wouldn’t you agree
The term varies, which is why I specified Denmark
IIRC He (Eske Bille) was controlling the amt for 10ish years, he was part of the “Bille” family which has an immense amount of power in both Norway and Denmark at the time
I think we have different views on what constitutes "necessity". Peat is used and is necessary for making an islay whisky, the same way chocolate is needed for a chocolate cake
But my point is that it's part of the design, and not because they can't dry their malts through other methods
I wouldn't say that some bakers still use chocolate to make their cakes
It of course came out of necessity, as timber was scarce on the windy Hebrides, but now it's a sought-out feature, and not a bug
The research done at the Carlsberg labs in the late 19th century was important for modern beer brewing, no doubt, but I feel like you brush over how basically everything else about the brewing at Carlsberg was German, from lagering as well as cold fermenting, which are two definite Bavarian brewing traits
I see, I welcome all jokes alcohol related
No, because English is pretty close to Danish
Things that many non-native English speakers complain about, such as it not being phonetic, or the pronunciation being awkward and all over the place, are the same in Danish
If not actually worse
I think that’s definitely a reason as to why we’re often ranked such good English speakers
So far English is the easiest language I have learned (the others being Danish and German)
I haven't had a big problem with it, no
Only thing I have an issue understanding and learning is German
I had a shitty teacher for a year (didn't learn shit), then i got stuck since
When summer rolls around, it'll be 3 years of me not learning a single thing in german
I've found it quite easy, in comparison to the tiny bit of German i speak
Even though German and English isn't that far off from each other
English is quite easy tbh, I've been decent at it for a while
Although when I look back at my youtube comments or just anything in general, I can see that I have improved drastically
I even cringe when I look back at it because I thought I was so damn good at English back then, but holy fuck
Playing video games and DnD made it a piece of cake to learn English, also a lot of words are similar so
Sort of the same, I learnt some of the MOST basic english when I started playing games, so when english rolled around to start in school, I was just going ahead of the class
Yeah, and you guys have a lot of French loanwords
Your word for ice cream for example
Yes
We find Swedish and Norwegian translations for words like “computer”, “teenager”, “tablet” and stuff really funny
Just feels so out of place
I mean, yeah
We have lended a few words from them
> Don’t you also have loan words that you haven’t changed
I’m pretty sure you just say “computer” and “elevator”, whereas here in Sweden we have our own Swedish words for those
That must at least help a bit with English vocabulary, right
It's a myth that Danish has more English loanwords than Norwegian and Swedish
It's just that in Danish loan words tend not to change their spelling
'Lunsj' in Norwegian is just as much a loan word as 'weekend' in Danish
You tend to notice the English loanwords when you listen to the other Scandinavian language if their loanwords are different
For instance, I notice 'lunsj' and 'kløtsj' in Norwegian and 'attackera' and 'cupen' in Swedish
You might notice 'computer' and 'software' in Danish
that's harsh
but yes our numbers are dumb asf
Damn I’d definitely have thought that sjåfør (we spell it chauffør) was a joke if you hadn’t mentioned it
That’s the type of spelling we’d use to indicate that someone is stupid and can’t spell lol
It's just something I heard in a radio programme a couple of years ago about differences in the Scandinavian languages, you can hear it here:
I guess it's just because you recognise english loan words immediately as loanwords when you hear them in Danish
But yeah, words from French and Low German are far more common
Angribe/attackera is a good example (should have checked that one
Passé simple isn't very common though
You mainly see it in written French
And even though every verb can be conjugated in many forms, most are regular, so you just need to learn 3 systems
Gunnuts arguing that their amount of easily accessible guns has nothing to do with homicide rates or school shootings
No more people that are shit at geography
Imo that is still a poor argument
You also have sparsely populated places in Europe where the police can take a long time to get there
I'm sure that you'd be able to find such places in Sweden - maybe even Austria with your mountains
Maybe you can find places that fits that in almost all countries in Europe - some countries has more or such areas than others
The fact that the American society is *overflowing* in guns does nothing good
There has been far too many school shootings, gun related crimes and gun related accidents
I also suppose that this has a say in why the American police can be quite trigger happy; everybody could have a gun so they're taking no chances
Anyway, I don't think that easily accessible guns are good for anybody
Your grandfather must have been a real globetrotter
Copenhagen = København
Cape Town = Kapstaden
Cologne = Køln
Venice = Venedig
Outside of a few, in Danish we generally keep the same word for the city as in their respective countries' native language
Examples:
Moscow = Moskva
Warsaw = Warszawa
Florence = Firenze
Belgrade = Beograd
We haven't ever translated an English city into Danish as far as I know
I am trying really hard to think of any but i just can't find one that is completely different
On the other han i can tell you we have a city called Nyborg which translated to English is Newcastle
As in Newcastle upon Tyne
I think that apart from Copenhagen and Elsinore (Helsingør) all cities in Denmark are called by their native name in English
I think in Elsinore’s case it’s due to Hamlet, but don’t know
Weirdly, the Swedish city just across the water (Helsingborg) has never been called Elsinburg
Copenhagen in Danish is København, which litterally means "Buy-a-habour"
To share a few more:
Nyborg would be "Newcastle"
Middelfart would "Average speed"
Did you forget Copenhagen/København ? :D
Helsingør / Elsinore
The only other city I can think of except Copenhagen is Helsingør/Elsinore
Otherwise we'll have to compare cities in Jutland with their German names, Haderslev/Hadersleben etc
Probably, but due to lenition it would've been called "Jorvig" today
That means if we were to be translating New York into Danish it would be "Ny Jorvig"
Edit: FYI, no one in Denmark calls York "Jorvik".
Yeah but thats boring :)
Twenty Øne Piløts as well
Jeg tror det er fordi de er misundelige på vores seje bogstaver
Copenhagen functioned as a toll point
Every ship who wanted to get in or out of the Baltic Sea through Øresund had to pay a fee to the danish crown
I’d imagine Copenhagen was named after the Baltic Sea because it functioned as a gate to get in and out
It was more so Helsingør and Helsingborg from what I recall
Could be wrong though
krak
dk is probably the most commonly known
It has more acurate toponyms and better quality ortophotos
Otherwise there is openstreetmap
I sometimes use topographic maps in Denmark
More detailed for hikes and nature trips
For 1 DKK you can get 2 packs of yeast and basically nothing else lol
For 10 you get a liter of milk, and for 100 you could get one of the cheap meals at McDonald's
Well I don't think there's really anything that I know of and would be interested in buying that costs 1 kr
However most lollipops costs 3,5 kr
if that counts
For 10 kr
I can buy a bag of potatoes from the neighboring farm and for 100 kr
I can buy a main dish from most chain Cafes/Restaurants like Zeros, Vivaldi or Cafe X.
For 1kr you can't really buy anything
Half a bolt in a hardware store or half a chewing gum (singular) in a gas station
For 10kr you can buy a Snickers
For 100kr you can buy a decent wine or a Vietnamese takeaway curry
Is the bag price because there's no government mandated price for plastic bags
But how much snus
...I should go to Romania for dinner
You consider that cheap
The price of milk has risen by like 50% in the last 5 years
I used to drink milk because I liked it, but now I only use it when I have to because I think it's gotten too expensive
I was still annoyed at the previous price increase when they raised it the most recently
Anything more than 1€ is too much
I think he meant, it's a cheap meal at a restaurant in Denmark
But you are correct, 100 DKK could get you one of the biggest menus at mcd
Our plastic bags are 4,5 dkk
No, that's a good price in a normal store
That price is similar to here as well
I live way out in the country side so the neighboring farm just happens to sell potatoes and eggs, so we buy those things from there and they're so cheap because they only sell them because they're excess from what the family can realistically eat
I don’t know if my definition of cursive is different, or we simply stopped teaching it early here in Scandinavia, but I am 40 years old and it was never taught in school
I am pretty sure it was taught when my parents went to school, but these days it’s really only old people who still use it, and I personally have a hard time reading cursive as it often just looks like a bunch of squiggels
I really haven’t had any experiences with scammers, or beggars doing weird stuff, except for the homeless immigrants in Copenhagen
One of them once yanked a bottle out of my hands
I know that’s nothing, but I don’t recall experiencing anything worse
It is not something that is commonly eaten here, but it is not seen as wierd
Terrible
I don't like seafood at all
Maybe fish and chips once in awhile
Lolland, the danish version of Alabama
Randers
Randers, a city of about 60K people in Jutland
It goes that people from Randers all drive on scooters, wear Nike Shoxs shoes and drink mokai
Probably Sweden since we’ve had so much history together
Lolland, the entire island of Funen for literally being a bridge between Denmark and Jutland, Western Juland and Southern Juland for being like Alabama
And there are soooo many Danish memes about taking Scania back
I feel like most people would happily make scania danish again
We’ll take back our trash thanks :)
Southern Jutland is also the danish version of Alabama
I wonder if that gonna change in the future once the island goes from being a dead-end remote corner of the country to the transport middle point between Copenhagen and Hamburg
At least the name will remain, that's the important part
mOkAi
Good luck here :)
“Lolland (Danish pronunciation: [ˈlɒˌlænˀ]; formerly spelled Laaland, literally "low land") is the fourth largest island of Denmark, with an area of 1,243 km2
Yup
Don’t forget its Latin name: Lalandia
Really
Vent er det der Lalandia kommer fik sit navn fra
Netop
Lalandia startede på Lolland, så derfor skulle verdens bedste feriested navngives så.
There is not really anything they do beter then where i live now
I could
But only after i have finished all of my education here and gotten a good chunk of work experience under my belt
Computer Engineers get a pretty good salary over there i believe, so i’d be fine, unlike a lot of other people who were born into the crappy system there
Permanently, probably not
But i would be open to living there for a couple of years
I don't think I could ever live in USA
I love to visit though, been there a few times at conferences
I’m studying to become an engineer, so getting a job with a good insurance and benefits probably wouldn’t be too difficult, but it would feel so wrong for me to live a (relatively) lush lifestyle knowing people are living without homes or food just down the street - with little to no chance of getting help
Needing a car in order to get anywhere is also a big fat no in my book
I’d like to visit some time though
No not really
In general I dont know if I want to permanently leave Denmark, but I would like to live abroad for a few years through a job
While I would not say no to the US, I would prefer somewhere in East/Southeast Asia
If i could live in the US i would choose to live in California in a city like Santa Barbara
I like the spanish colonial architecture of California
The climate is perfect for me and i like to live near the sea
But i would only wanna live there if i had a good well paying job + health care insurance
I love to visit and go to a lot of places there, but I wouldn't want to live there, at least not permanently
The (lack of) healthcare system alone would keep me from moving there - especially with children
Gun laws and the educational system would concern me aswell
&#x200B;
If I had an attractive job offer in a safe area I might consider moving as a single adult
Yeah but it would be even better IF we reconquered Scania
And mämmi
I'm not sure, but liberal in Danish means conservative party (Republican)
Why are you opposed to comprosises
I'm curious
Isn't that the whole point with our multi-party system, that any government has to compromise with parties on both sides, to best represent the entire population
Genuinly curious
I can work 7 or 0 days in a week, my choice
I really think you are mis-representing and generalizing liberals in Denmark
What does pro-labour even mean
No party in Denmark is against good conditions for working people, and certainly no party is against the welfare state
In fact, many of them want to relieve taxes from working people, meaning they have more money and running a business overall becomes cheaper, you could argue that is pro-labour
The liberal parties (namely LA, V and K) mainly run on a platform of personal freedom, and then an acknowledgement of what makes the welfare state possible in the first place: private businesses and innovation (they are the vast majority of the GDP), thus wanting better conditions for them
None of them want a worse welfare state
> And I dont believe the point of a multi-party system is compromise
Compromise often is a result of multi-party systems, but it isn't, and shouldn't be, the rule
> This means that when I am talking about being pro-labour, I am talking about the ideologies that are not the dominant ideology, not the superstructure, but rather are pro-labour in that they aim for a change in ideology from a liberal ideology to an ideology for the continuation of the emancipation of the labouring class
Let me ask you like this then: How, in your view, is the labouring class not emancipated yet
In my view, emancipation of the labouring class, and the personal freedom that modern liberalism promotes go hand in hand
> I am saying that in the broadest meaning of the word 'liberalism' I am opposed to that certain ideological direction
Of course, that is understandable
This is, I presume, the same way I am opposed to the ideological direction of Socialism
This is a natural effect of people being different, and why I was initially curious when I read your original comment as you opposing compromises
I suppose there is not need in arguing semantics, or even ideologies
Originally I was mostly curious, since I (probably mis-read) your comments as being opposed to compromises
As you can probably guess, I am mostly centre-right, but I believe the key to a successful democracy is one, where everybody's opinion matters, and thus comprosises is at the core of the process and an extremely important part of how the country is run
I think it is very normal here to be open about pregnancies and giving birth, my mom have been pretty open about it and I work with mostly women who aren't afraid to talk about both in a positive and negative way
Yeah and quite openly
It is not a big deal in Denmark
New moms  are put together with other new moms and meet up to exchange sstories/support
It's not too intimate to ask if you know the person and have a good reason to be curious
Can't just randomly ask an aunt at the buffet how giving birth felt
My SO talked a lot with her friends about it before her first child
Having witnessed a child birth I get that it can be too much of personal experience involving too much of your private parts to share with anyone, but it's clearly also a major event in life and an unusual ordeal to endure
After birth every first time mother is invited to join a "mom group" and from what I understand talking about the pregnancy and its culmination is the major topic
Agree
You get all the details all the time
And it's ok
Kebab pizza is probably the most popular one in Denmark too
Some call it Saladpizza but the ingredients are usually the same
[Look's like the same as our Risengrød.]

Danija is a beautiful name for Denmark
Cool
I'm sure it's equivalent (and probably inherited from) Latin -ia, as in Russia, Dania, Italia, etc
In Danish we have our own equivalent, -en, which is used in place of it (Prussia is Prøjsen, Italia is Italien, etc)
The only one I can think of right now, is a bar in Århus called "Bar her og der" which both means "Bar here and there" as well as "Just here and there", which is a common answer to say when people ask you where you are/have been
I've been there
It's really great
Everybody should go there
You should go there
For Iceland its the Edda, written in the 13th century
Asgard, Rangnarök, Thor, Odin and all that jazz
Not to my knowledge
Some authors and works stand out from the rest though
Most kids in Denmark know some of the fairy tales by Hans Christian Andersen, like "The Emperor's New Clothes", "The Little Mermaid", "The Nightingale", "The Steadfast Tin Soldier", "The Princess and the Pea", "The Snow Queen", "The Ugly Duckling" and so on
As you get a bit older, you would most likely read some plays by Ludvig Holberg (1684-1754), who is known as the founder of modern Danish literature
His comedies are still often played at lots of theaters around the country
The most famous ones are probably "Jeppe paa Bjerget" and "Erasmus Montanus".
Later on, you might study the philosophical works of Søren Kierkegaard, but most Danes probably haven't read them
If you are a Christian and visit the Danish church, maybe you will notice that many of the psalms that are sung, are written by an author called N. F. S. Grundtvig
He wrote more than 1500 psalms, 253 if which is in the standard book of psalms in the Danish church today, and religious or not - I don't think it is possible to grow up in Denmark without ever having heard some of them
Most famous is probably: "Et barn er født i Betlehem", "Dejlig er den himmel blå", "Det er så yndigt at følges ad", "Hil dig, Frelser og Forsoner" and "Nu falmer skoven trindt om land". He was pretty influential in the 19th century and while he is today mostly known for his psalms and the schools he founded, he actually also made the first full translation of Beowulf into a modern language in 1820 and from that point on was very inspired by old Anglo-Saxon literature
As an honorable mention, the stories from the Nordic Mythology about Odin, Thor and the rest of the old Gods are also popular here, as in the rest of the Nordic countries
It’s put together from bits and pieces (depending on the version) and written in a very old prose hundreds of years ago
But read the secondary literature to understand it and it’s context
Wild deer wander in to our yard at the summer house, which is close to a forest
Also hares and foxes
In Copenhagen there are a lot of foxes, which you sometimes see
Domesticated cats are everywhere
yeah you often find deer (and hares) near houses (think summerhouses) far from cities
My concerns have more to do with the treatment  of migrants workers and that FIFA seemingly doesn’t care at all despite being fully aware of it
The price for the construction of the stadium are  human lives
probably several thousands by now
Agreed
Every liberal democrstic country should boycot it
I honestly don't know, and I don't understand it either
I much prefer northern dishes to southern dishes
I will agree that southern dishes *look* fancier though with a lot more colors etc
due to the variety of vegetables, fruits etc
they have down there
Maybe that is the reason
The natural variety in produce
Back in the day you'd have a real problem growing a lot of the things we regularly use in dishes today in large parts of northern Europe
Things needed to be able to survive the winters, periods with a lot of rain, little sunlight etc
in the more northern parts
Growing up, my father (Who i lived with for most of the time) cooked
he mostly cooked classic danish food
in his kitchen kabinet he had:
Salt
Pepper
that's it
i mean, the food was fine
but
my mother uses like spices from all over the world
these days, i only use salt
Name a culture where food doesn’t play an important role, though
> Also, idk if a fact, but imo the soil down south is richer in minerals and makes for tastier fruits and vegies
Also, it stays warmer for more of the year
Longer growing seasons matter more
> Not to mention the most complex, long-fermented beers in the world (Belgian, German, British
even the Baltics do amazing underrated things with dark lagers and stouts)
Outside of Germany, most of these cultures primarily use ale yeasts, which are quick fermenters, except for the spontaneously fermented lambics and Flemish red ales in Belgium
Also traditionally, you would find complex brewing cultures in all of Northern Europe, but since they were based on the individual farms, they have almost died out after industrialisation and urbanisation in the mid-19th century
Hell, even Germany used to have a lot more diversity in their beer landscape, with Western German beers being closer to Belgian and Dutch beers, while Northern German beers were closer to Scandinavian beer, but this took a blow, when Germany was united and their style of brewing was heavily restricted because of the adoption of Bavarian legislation(Reinheitsgebot), which favoured traditional Bavarian brewing
Nowadays you can still find some old dudes in Norway's rural side making beer like they always did, with yeast cultures that in some examples have been kept alive since medieval times, and thanks to primarily one man, who toured the area a few years ago, West Norwegian yeasts(kveik) are some of the most hyped yeasts in homebrewing circles and among smaller breweries
In case you are interested, you can read more about it on [this blog
He also later goes to Lithuania and Estonia, and documents their traditional brewing cultures
I guess I understand it but I really dislike how smug they act about it
And how snobbish they often are about food in general, with each other especially
Eh, for some foods, butter is way better than olive oil
The milk proteins and lactose in butter just contribute in a way, which no oil does
> A lot of our food is not mass produced, in a lot of mediterranian countries what you guys consider "organic food" - its just considered "food".
[Yeah buddy, that's just like straight up not true
It's all to do with the fact, that it's warmer, which allows for more kinds of vegetables and fruits to be grown
I wouldn't say that dining time is the absolute highlight of the day in the north - at least not in a regard higher than "yay, time to fill the belly"
I think the problem is that it tastes like fish
I absolutely hate fish
It doesn't smell like something you should eat
I would eat so much more fish if the prices for it were better, or if I had better fish shops nearby
> They tend to get rather creative with their recipes and choice of produce from what I've experienced
But most adhere very strictly to the foraging movement, and only makes it with things you realistically can find in Scandinavia
It's basically why ramson all of a sudden got super popular to use
Yeah paella is bland af
Yeah or Mexican, Thai, Vietnamese or *real* Chinese food
Salt is a mineral tho, spices come from plants
Still doesn’t mean it’s unimportant
I find that cooking and good food is pretty important in Denmark, and our national dishes really adds to our sense of Danish-ness
Fresh fish in general should only smell like salt water, if fish smells, it's has started to go bad, [and produce this very foul smelling amine]
>Other cultures similarly poor in resources or variety of foodstuffs available could do much with very little, even often in the way of ritual
No where in the world has people lived so north in such high numbers as Northern Europe and Russia, so I don't really know what you are comparing to
Inuits in Canada, Alaska and Greenland
Their cuisines are also primarily hunted meat and fish, that has been fermented or dried
I'm really interested in knowing what your examples are
If you read the source, they mention several cook books from the late 15th century
Eh, you could also grow way more food and vegetables than many places in Northern Europe
Try to grow tomatoes in Denmark without a greenhouse
Your output is going to suck
Yeah, but in the south good food is life or death
It's incredible how much time and energy they spend on it; I've learned that there is no such thing as 'just food' down there
Guess I've never had a fresh fish then
Don't feel like I'm missing anything, bad smelling fish has ruin it for me
But I don't see why they should be critiqued for being creative with the native resources
You are going to a restaurant, aren't you expecting to get something better or more interesting than you can cook yourself
Food is not set in stone, it's always evolving
There was a time, when lasagna, or screw that, anything with tomato was not really representative of Italian food, but try to open a restaurant, that only serves broccoli, and see how well it goes
Do you also go to a concert and criticise the orchestra for playing more complex music, than what most people know how to play or compose
Okay, there are a lot of things to address here, I don't even know where to begin
First of all, most mountains ranges have low valleys, and most are not so vast, that there are no lowlands nearby
Take for example Nepal, the country of Mt
Everest and the Sherpas
Sure, they have areas with mountains that dwarf any other mountain in the world, [but significant parts of the country are less than a 100 metres above sealine] and many parts of the country [are comparable to Spain in terms of height] and [guess where most people live
Yeah that's right, in the low, non-mountainous parts of the country or the valleys]
The Andes, and specifically Peru and Chile [were some of the areas were agriculture independently began] and Peru is home to more different kinds of potato and tomato than anywhere else in the world, how do you combine that with the theory, that they should be limited in what crops they can grow
It's literally where we got shitload of our most popular crops from
And plus a lot of their popular dishes are born out of the Spanish Empire, since there's no other way they could have pork and cows
Moving on to Russian cuisine
Russian culture was historically centred in what now is Ukraine and Southern Russia, around Moscow, [and it's also where most people live today] and if you look at this [map of Europe] if you see that brown-red colouring, that is all over Ukraine and Southern Russia, that represents the soil type called "chernozem" which means black soil, and is known as one of the most fertile soil types there is, and it's one of the regions that grow the most grain in the World
And the final thing, [here's a map of Japan, that you used as an example as a comparable place to Scandinavia earlier] I placed a marker smack dab in Tokyo, and if you see on the right map, you can see that it lies on the latitude as Tangier in Morocco
Sure it gets colder in Japan than in Morocco, but the daylight is way more evenly distributed there, than in Scandinavia, where there are places, where you basically don't see the sun for between 3 and 6 months
[The same is true for Nepal] and [a big part of the Andes Mountains are in the Tropics]
Poland has great food
Żurek is also underrated
It honestly makes sense that Americans mix us up all the time, even if they do it for the wrong reasons
Again, where exactly did you expect the culture to come from
It's a thing that takes generations to develope
But even then, we are doing pretty well nowadays, if you've never had modern Danish haute cuisine, try it
In Danish its “Det tysk-romerske rige” -roughly translates to “The german-roman Empire”
Det Hellige Tysk-romerske rige (Holy German-romam empire)
>The German-Roman ~~Empire~~ Realm
Only ever encountered it without hellige/holy
Yes
Rige is somewhere in between empire and realm, but not really either
We have *kejserrige* in Danish or *imperie*, but *rige* is a general and broad definition same as realm in English and reich in German
So a littoral translation of *rige* would be realm, but yes in a more correct context it should be understood as *kejserrige* (empire)
I actually choose the word empire based on the fact there was a proclaimed emperor, even though the title did not align In power with the title of emperor in the previous Roman empire
No, not really
Among the younger generation it's also quite common to see English words conjugated using Danish grammar
So for instance, "I accidentally liked his picture" would be "jeg kom til at like hans billede" instead of "jeg kom til at syntes godt om hans billede"
I feel Denmark and Norway are always at battle when it comes to this
In Denmark we took the approach of basically accepting every loan word, whereas in Norway they made new words
Example:
English: Tablet (like an iPad)
Danish: Tablet
Norwegian: Nettbrett
I've even heard a joke in Denmark about the word for sleeping bag in Norwegian is kropskondom (body condom)
Ofc that's not true, but if I told that to a fellow Dane, there would be good chance of them believing it
Not as far as I know
With these things you need to be ahead of the foreign adoptions instead of a corrective force afterwards, at least in my country people aren't gonna stop saying "computer" even if there's an official push for a replacement
Back in the 90s when a lot of IT related words were new or only recently widely used, there should have been an official effort to provide well thought out Danish alternatives, instead it was a jungle where competing Danish versions were more often than not rather awkward and lengthy, which only assured we would generally just go with the English words
At any rate, if you take a bird's eye view of language it's impossible to maintain the idea that loan words are inherently bad and should be avoided
My own language has been particularly enriched by German (about 17% of the words in a random Danish text came from German), and it feels a bit a-historical or ignorant to see the current adoption of English words as anything but natural language evolution - after all no one is today complaining about "arbejde", "altså", "virkelig", "bevidsthed" etc as German loan words ruining Danish
No but we do have a meme page where English is forbidden  @dankmark
>Skriðdreki = tank (military)
Haha, sounds almost like the Danish word "Skidrik" (Skithrik) which is a slightly outdated word for an arsewhole or bastard
Kind of makes sense ;)
In a lot of software programs I will generally use the English language option because I spend more time thinking about the intention of a setting/button when it’s translated into Danish
Yes
The grammar of verbs is usually translated to Danish
In nouns we often keep the english grammar for plural, like in tank, tanks
But we make up our own form for determite plural which english doesn’t have (the tanks) we use danish grammar, tanksene/tankene
Yes :D
In Denmark people are split between pronouncing weekend as "Vikend" or "Wikend". I only ever hear people from Sjælland, mainly people from Copenhagen, pronouncing it the latter option, the same pronunciation as in English
I was told by an English speaker that I (and most Danes, according to him) have a habit of using "learned" when we should be using "was taught", due to Danish using "lært" for "was taught". Since he pointed it out I've caught myself doing it once or twice, so it's certainly a thing I do
I also have a hard time spelling the word "definitely" so in general, I try to avoid using it - often rephrasing sentences to do so
Prepositions are tough
I just edited a comment 3 or 4 times because I wasn't sure I used the correct one
I'm still not sure, I used the right one
Also used to and use to
They almost always feel like the wrong one and that it should be the other
It's funny, because in Danish it seems to be English influencing Danish
We also write compound words as one word ('bildør' for car door), but a lot of Danes have started splitting up the compound words in Danish, so they would say 'bil dør', which is wrong
I saw a rule for spelling necessary
A shirt has one Collar(c) and two Sleeves(s) and both are necessary
It somehow stuck onto my brain and now I can spell necessary
Unfortunately not, I'd maybe remember that it's a combination of 'selv' (self) and 'følge' (follow) and 'lig' (equal (to) or corpse) and then spell those three separately
It means "of course" but some things can also be a 'selvfølge' which means that of course you have this thing, of course you deserve it
I don't know if there's an English word for that though
I don't think we have one of those tbh, I certainly can't think of anyone who's idolized to that degree
We obviously have our football "heroes", actors etc
but I wouldn't say it's anywhere near the level of idolization that JP II seems to have in Poland
Queen Margrethe is liked by most
Maybe not idolized though
Yes, Ludovici Orban is a different guy
Probably not as much as in the anglosphere, but I'm sure it exists
In Denmark there's been a big antivaxx movement
Not so much because people think it cause autism, but that it makes people sick
Especially a few years back when girls +13 could get cervix cancer vaccinations, and there were a few cases of girls (of course not related to the vaccine shot) got very ill, seemingly after having gotten the vaccine
Climate change deniers is also big, also in the parlament
I think flat-earthers is the rarest, they dont get any kind of puplic recognition if they exist
Not nearly to the same extent as you see from the USA but it does exist
I haven't encountered any Danish flat earthers but there are other nutters out there
What's interesting is that climate change seems to be more of a "I don't *want* it to be true so I just deny it
" kinda thing from staunch capitalist types etc
and I'm not even convinced that *they* believe it themselves, it seems to be about adherence to the ideology and not actual conviction
On the other hand the """""health"""""" stuff seems to be from (relatively) far left types
The gluten avoiding, cell phone causing cancer, "Natural = Healthy", antivaxx, "ohhh scary GMO
" type stuff mostly seems to be left wing nonsense from my experience
Obviously there are exception to both types of nonsense but that seems to be the general trend
Another interesting thing is that most of the right wing climate change stuff seems to be done by men, while most of the hippie-health-delusion crap seems to be done by women
Again, this is obviously only from my own experience and exceptions exist here as well
Nah, our idiots belive in clima change stuff, but
they're just sometimes kind of stupid
Average stupid people in denmark
Oh they are here, sadly
He has a point
If you can think for yourself
"Experts" say and "sources" say are often just something papers use to back some claim up that can easily be false
I guess Russia will be Russia, but not much else
We forgive you
But can we please have Holstein back
We look weird without it
I'd say a good 50% of the subs I subscribe to I can't relate to 90% of the posts
The only subs where I can relate to are subs that are inherently international, and in many of those there are many posts I still can't relate to because they focus on an American perspective
All of the internet in America-centric
The amount of times I've gotten into discussions with Americans who just couldn't see that their reality isn't mine
Well
It more than I can be bothered to count
Especially when it comes to, as a woman, discussions on feminism and inequality, Americans seems to equate their everyday life with being similar in all of the western world
And it just isn't. And if you point out that many of their issues simply doesn't exist in places like Denmark, they freak and tell you, you're in denial or anti-feminism
I'm not, I just don't think their agenda is universal
However, the only subreddit it actually annoys me is here on AskEurope
So many Americans answering the subs and try and make it about America
Listen, you have the rest of the internet
Let us have our own space please and stop trying to make everything about you
On any sub that's dominated by Americans you'll feel "alienated" quite often from my experience
They just seem to see a lot of things completely differently than others, seem to do certain things in their own ways etc
which means a lot of the answers on /r/AskReddit etc
just don't apply to anyone but Americans and yet they're upvoted like made making it seem like it's some universal truth
You also regularly see people using example from the USA, American history etc
to "explain" things in other parts of the world when in fact it's USA that has an extremely unusual and special history
It's in no way representative
Most countries were not colonized by all sorts of different people like that at all
It's the USA that stands out in that regard, not the rest of the world "not getting it".
Its way harder to be funny
It’s tricky to convey irony
You can’t play with the words
You can’t throw out a fast remark
It’s just difficult
Well, I think I act a bit more constrained as I cannot as easily identify personality from the way of speech of foreigners as I can when talking to other Danes
Also my choice of words becomes different, less "dialect", as I use "standard" English, so my personality also is not as present when I speak English as when I speak Danish
As far as I am concerned, speaking another language fluently, is all about acting
You might pretend you are that guy from TV, and sound like him
So you have to let go of yourself and also start acting a bit differently
I feel a lot more expressive, less anxious and less Self-conscious when I'm speaking English
I've got major social anxiety whenever I'm speaking Danish
Facts
They are compensated for very unusual hours e.g. starting at 4 in the morning, so it makes sense really
København: Capital, crazy night life, shopping, worlds second oldest amusement park in the world, (the worlds oldest is Bakken, 10 min
Away from København)
Aarhus: people Call Aarhus Capital of Jylland, culture Capital 2017, one of the oldest cities in Denmark
Odense: Hans Christian Andersen
Aalborg: student city, Jomfru Ane Gade(party street), carnival, the Paris of the north
It’s probably for the best that you didn’t mention Randers
(But for real it’s not that bad
As a dane I wouldn't mind if it was disbanded, and a Scandinavian Union was formed in it's stead
Isn't Finland part of Scandinavia, or was I scammed by my elementary teacher
Damn
Nice to know
Worth noting that not all Franks switched to Vulgar Latin/Proto-French
Those living in the regions originally inhabited by the Frankish tribes kept speaking their language, which eventually developed into modern Dutch
> One theory offered is they also brought disease not native to the local population which led to a reduction in both population density and societal cohesion
That seems unlikely
There is no clear evidence of a population reduction prior to the Germanic settlement, and we can see from genetic evidence that Celtic (or more properly, 'pre-Germanic') DNA constitutes a large part of English genetic heritage
In fact, it forms a gradient, with the easternmost parts of the country around Kent and East Anglia having the most Anglo-Saxon DNA, and the west having the least
This is exactly what we would expect with a gradual settlement, where more and more people were assimilated into Saxon culture as they spread west
It does not, however, fit well with any idea of a sudden depopulation prior to, or during, the invasion
A lot of people are clearly ashamed by it, which seems rather ridiculous to me
Like a sort of cultural self-castration
Obviously it is unacceptable by today's standards, but back-projecting those standards onto the past and then condemning people for failing to live up to them is just madness
Beyond that, it is simplistic
Nearly every nation once had some sort of imperial power, or at least a local power-projection over other nations, and the ones that didn't certainly weren't being push-overs out of the goodness of their hearts
When Britain first arrived in India, much of the continent was ruled by the Mughals, and before that, by various other empires, Indian or not
Even the concept of "India" as a unified place is a colonial construct, which has only ever been close to being achieved throughout history due to imperialist conquests
None of that is to say that the British Empire was *ok*, per say, or that it was an objective good
What it was, however, was one power in a world of competing powers
The Brits just happened to be particularly good at it, and now happen to be particularly self-loathing about that fact
Put differently, a world in which the British Empire was *evil* (and I'm not saying you claim it is, but many do) is a world in which nearly every nation and people before the 20th century is evil
England too now that we're at it
Living in a quite homogeneous country with not so much diversity, it’s practically impossible to tell where somebody is from based on their names
However, if you allow me to include Sweden and Norway then there are quite a few giveaways
Sweden - using the German letters ä and ö is a clear sign that somebody is Swedish
Also when their last names ends with “son” as opposed to “sen” is also a bit of a giveaway
Norway - I love some Norwegian names because they sound like they came straight out of a fairy tale
They don’t sound foreign, but at the same time they do
Thinking of names such as Øyvind, Torgeir, Vebjørn, Gjermund
As far as i know there are no first or surnames that can tell where someone is from in Denmark
Jensen is a sure tell
Same goes for most other last names ending in Sen, as Swedish, Norwegian and English use Son
Yeah at most within the country, the last name with -gaard can tell you something about either what type of farm a person's ancestors had (Roesgaard, Melgaard, aso) what was around it (Skovgaard, Aagaard, Brønsgaard, aso), or where it was within the area they are from (Søndergaard, Nørregaard, Østergaard, aso)
But then that doesn't really tell you where the forest was, or which city they had the eastern farm in
So it's basically impossible
> Living in a quite homogeneous country with not so much diversity, it’s practically impossible to tell where somebody is from based on their names
Kofoed and Anker (last names) are super common on Bornholm
But other than that, there are hardly any regional differences in Denmark
I 1773 kom der en navnelov for Hertugdømmerne (Struenses navnelov) . I følge denne lov kunne bønderne tage faste familienavne, som skulle følge familien i al fremtid og de kunne således gå bort fra det "ægte patronykom", hvilket vil sige faderens fornavn plus -sen el
-datter
If we include Greenland, then it's easy too
Its because it's a contraction of "Anders son", "Jans son". I guess you kept the original spelling, and the Americans just contracted it to fit pronunciation, as did we
Gud ja, det er da også rigtigt
But I believe it’s a Swedish thing
In Denmark it’s still “Andersen, Jensen and Larsen” with just one s.
Haha, jamen det kan godt ske
Vi har bare ikke særligt mange af disse “eksotiske” navne her i Danmark, lol
Ah, just from what I've seen, it's usually son
Thanks for letting me know
We do
Norway writes it -sen because of Danish, and Danish does it because of how our language developed
Word-final vowels All became /e/, which is also why we have "hest**e**" instead of "häst**a**r" and "danske" instead of "svensk**a**". "Søn" is a standalone word, and so wasn't affected, but -sen is at the end of words
Yeah it's because of us
The sound-change that turned -son into -sen only happened in Danish, so it's probably a result of surnames having been introduced during the period of Danish rule

I knew a guy who's one sentance in Danish was
"Jeg vil gerne en dansk statsborgerskab, Jeg er liderlig" it was pretty funny
for me personally, it has to go to "Kackvogel" I don't remember where I leanred that
And also a little poem I was taught by a chinese classmate
"对不起，没关系，打个屁，臭死你“ or "Sorry, it's okay, big fart, so smelly it kills you" the guy was known for being immature, so I don't think there is any deep meaning for this
I can confirm jeg er en pølse works in danish too
I mean it is technically true
I remember "Paraste ennen" ... :)
Nice one to know
Some Belgian exchange students :)
Thank you so much
Slightly different spelling in Danish: må ikke tildækkes
Beautifully put
Reads like a poem
I feel the same about spring here in Denmark
Early spring/summer mornings is my favorite
Ahh, got you .
Most of the songs from 2002 and up
They are just boring and forgettable
A personal worst is our 2016 entry Soldiers of Love by Lighthouse X, i can't stand that song
I still think My Lovely Horse by Ted and Dougal should have been your 8th Eurovision victory
Always been a mystery to be how the UK can produce some of the best and most popular music in the world, yet still end up next to last almost every year
Most Finnish songs from before 1999, got underrated because the juries could not understand what was being sung
It's pretty sad since Finland often sends very fun and good songs
It's actually a good song, ruined by mistakes made by the Ukrainian production
(They started the Moldovian track in the middle of the song)
Okay but cliche love song was worse imo
25% of the Latvian population is Russians and speak Russian
So not completely irrational
+ The decision of how to sing the song is only up to the Television Company (Latvijas Televīzija) and the artist
Fx, in 2007, Latvia did send "Questa Notte" by Bonaparti
They were amazing
Anneke Grönloh sang "Jij bent mijn leven" at Eurovision
Not Brandend Zand
That year in 1982, the contest was held in Harrogate in the United Kingdom
Spain's song that year was an Argentinian Tango
Don't be too worried about those rules:)
Disco pogo came to Denmark in full force as well
You were good in 98'. The other years from 1997-2002, you were mediocre or trash
But they still pay taxes, to fund Latvijas Televīzija
And again, it's his and Latvijas Televīzija own choice
He could have chosen to sing it in Swahili if Latvijas Televīzija agreed to it
I think your problems with Russians as a people (russophobia), is making you hate the song, just because one version of it is in Russian
He did sing it in Latvian at Eirodziesma 2009
His vocal performance was terrible
It is only a Latvian artist singing in Russian
It is not a discussion of politics
We don't do that here in Denmark
Most of Denmark was neutral during the first world war
I say most of Denmark because southern Jutland had become part of Germany when we lost the war of 1864, so a lot of Danish men were forced to fight for the Germans
But I don't think that the people in southern Jutland wears poppies to commemorate that
The only part of Denmark that was in WW1 is Sønderjylland
I think they did have some sort of remembrance, but no longer
And they certainly don't wear a red poppy
Same
If only that had worked for WW2
Historically it absolutely is though
North Germany and Platt has had a huge influence on Denmark since the 10th century and 1864
>That makes me wonder how the whole 1864 affaire could happen in the first place, with Germans and Danish being so close lol
You never heard about the fact, that the King at the time, Christian IX secretly proposed to Bismarck, that all of Denmark would enter the German Confederation following the defeat
> By that logic, Russia, Czechia, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia, Croatia, Romania, Poland and a few other countries are also practically german
Flensburg was the second largest city in all of the Danish Realm untill 1864, and Kiel was the third largest, and Kiel had one of the only two universities
We have just as little here in Denmark
But the Danish navy “splitflag” is nice i think
Its a slightly different red than our normal flag
We've only had the one we use so
yeah
I suppose one could theoretically argue that the [Raven Banner] was a flag, and I quite like that
We don't really have a choice afaik
That should be your symbol is instead of the cross
I guess that’s why we usually score a bit higher than you in happiness
You’re just a little too blue
Danish has jalousi(noun)/jaloux(adverb) which is about personal and usual romantic feelings
Skinsyg (lit
skin sick) is an older and not widely used synonym
Then there is misundelse(noun)/misundelig(adverb) which is envy about belongings/status etc
Misundelse is probably sometimes used about romantic feelings too, idk
Jalousi and misundelse
People do use them interchangeably, but that's honestly pretty infuriating
It's a great melody for sure
Unfortunately can't use youtube at the moment for Danish content due to a dispute between the Danish music industry and google, so I can't hear this version
You Finns are funny with your tango passion by the way
Ohh fuck
lauhgs in like 10-20 different dialects/languges despite having a population of only 5
8 mil
its crazy how many dialects there are just in my city(copenhagen) there alot of dialects that makes it possible to know which part of the city they are from
I would honestly say we don’t have that many distinct dialects
Accents, sure a little bit
But the only really distinct dialects I can think of are lollandsk, Sønderjysk and bornholmsk
Perhaps some of the other smaller islands like Langeland as well
And even then they’re rarely spoken
I went to boarding school in Sønderjylland with people from all over the country including Bornholm and never had a single problem, I noticed very few pronunciation differences
And just in Copenhagen
I live in Copenhagen, what
Never noticed this at all
Oh fuck I ended up mixing dialects and accents
What about northern Jylland with Vendelbomål, strong western jutland dialects
I’ve lived in both western and eastern Jutland, and there are massive differences
Even in the eastern part where I live now, there’s quite the difference between Randers, Mols and Aarhus
That’s probably true, but it’s not even close to a country like Norway where there are like ten different words for I.
Berlin is considered the cultural capital of Europe, London the economic and Paris the fashion one

Used to know a few more
Different spelling (takk and tak) but almost same pronunciation
You can also include Islandic and Faroese as it's the same as the other Nordic countries - except Finland, that is

The Coldplay song "Yellow" has the line "your skin and bones" which sound like "jeg sked en bums" (I shat a pimple) in Danish
A couple of years ago I was at a Coldplay concert in Copenhagen and the entire standium basically shouted the "danish lyrics" instead of the OG
The government did make that commercial about how Danes should have more sex (eg more kids), which got a bit of criticism - though mainly abroad
Dont think many cared much either or tbh
porre in danish means means a leak (as in the plant) and my family had a game with wierd word plays when I was a kid

So I think about singing a song about leaks

quick correction, it's connecting with Lolland, not Sjælland :)
>and I’m pretty excited about it, because it’ll make going to Sweden a lot easier
We just cancelled the whole thing
Sorry, you're gonna have to figure out something else
Danish pastries are called wienerbrød (viennese bread) in Danish because of the Austrian bakers that introduced and popularized the baking techniques
Reminds me of Wienerbrød (Viennabread), only we call it that apparently, everywhere else it's a Danish
This is a fact
He's not wrong though
Lolland is part of region Sjælland and calling the regions provinces is a pretty minor mistake, so claiming that the bridge connects with region(or province) is completely true
That is correct
You can click [this link] to see how it's done

From there you can switch to a train driving to Munich which can take around 6,5 hours

I don't think Denmark would necessarily win it big, but it's an official sport in France and I want it to get more recognition
If I had to pick a sport that Denmark could dominate then it would probably be the ancient art of making fun of Sweden (though Norway could probably also compete there)
Beer Bowling
Awesome to play, and fun to watch for spectators as well
I thought it was revolutions
Counter strike
That is what Denmark can win

In Denmark we got the [Nihilistic Peoples Party] - Which goal is to ban chucch bells on sundays, because most people got hangovers, and that everything doesn't matter, exacept cute animals
They also said that if a teenager is playing 8 hours or more of World of Warcraft, he should be allowed to miss school and get paid
The Vegan party who have compared meat-eaters to Nazis
Something like Spain or Poland
If smaller than those, I would define them as 'small'ish
I think that countries like Germany or France are big
As for Europe, the smallest country that I'd consider big (population wise) would probably be Spain, Ukraine or Poland
We’re probably the biggest Kingdom considering Greenland and Faroe Islands
Unless that title still goes to England
I don’t know what countries they still rule
We have no islands next to Antarctica, Norway has
We do have the Faroe Islands in addition to Greenland
England is not a kingdom
The UK is a kingdom
Belgium probably has more horizontal land than Norway tho
I think we have them on all trains except the metro in Copenhagen and the light rail in Aarhus
yep
although in some trains smaller trains they don't make sense, as there's no door or whatever in btween
i've also seen a quiet zones on ships
All the trains I've been on during school trips have had quiet zones, assume it's on most
Also on the longer bus routes, very common
However, in my experience of riding those with other commuters in the early morning, they are silent as the grave throughout the entire bus anyway
> they are silent as the grave
gotta focus on the smartphone
Kerteminde
Not really a good reason just nostalgia
Also it got great ice cream
Aalborg
Been there a lot
Great atmosphere, big town vibe
Aalborg
Just a very chill atmosphere, and good nightlife (before corona)
I would say Aarhus
It's about 6 hours by train away from me, but that's why I enjoy it
Me and my girl went there on our first vacation together there, and it's beautiful and cosy
Krakow was great when I was there in the summer
Less people this year, which was actually nice
Sounds interesting
Care to share
I would imagine
Imagine the culture of r/dankmemes (being overly stupid) coupled with broken, directly translated words
Now out all of that on things that only a Dane would know, and you have r/dankmark
/r/dankmark got you covered
r/okkammeratmongol
Good thing there always will be ironic good morning chat pictures to provide a meme baseline
Do you have any filters in place to make your Reddit experience a little less overwhelmingly American (or just more catered towards your personal interests)
I have about 5 variations of "9/11" added as filters since around this time of year, my feed seems to get clogged up with posts about it and it's kind of exhausting
The same goes for Halloween, a holiday I don't celebrate and find kind of obnoxious and annoying
There are a couple of terms relating to my hobbies that I filter out as they tend to go hand in hand with drama in the subreddits
People having the same fights about the same thing 3 times a month gets old, especially since the thing in question is more relevant to users in the US
Please tell me how you filter things
Filtereddit is a feature of the Reddit Enhancement Suite
Happy googling
The only annoying thing I've noticed about it is that it will mistake the word "in" for an abbreviation of inches, so if a text reads "1978 in Germany", the extension will convert that to "1978 in (5,024 cm)˜ Germany".
Oh, I forgot about 4th of July, that's going on the list
I avoid /r/all like the plague, but those themes get into so many unrelated subreddits as well: hobby subs full of "Look what I made for St
Patty's Day, guys
" or "We thought we'd do something different for Halloween this year", etc
Even benign nature subreddits are subject to things like an abundance of images of bald eagles around the 4th of July
Hence the need for keyword filters
What usually happens at that point is insane mod drama
I admit to just bringing out the popcorn and watching it all go up in flames until everything implodes
Oh, yeah, I still much prefer to have it on than not, it just throws me off a sentence sometimes
A lot less than having to read everything in imperial, though
Sex education in week 6 (sex and the number six is pronounced the same in Denmark) all up until 8th/9th grade
It was decent
Week 6 is national sex ed week, so children have sex Ed during that week all through school (0-9 grade) until high school
In high school a organization called the sexualisterne visit and give lectures
I lended a book in the library
Also the school did quite I bit
We don’t get any
only had it once in grade 6 or 7 i think, but yeah week 6
The Indian yogis who developed modern yoga or the kind of yoga most people think of with all the focus on stretching and bending took inspiration from Danish/Swedish gymnastics
Many of these moves are to be found in the book “Grundgymnastik eller primitiv gymnastik" by gymnast Niels Ebbesen Mortensen Bukh
In original yoga a posture(or asana) simply means to sit, a seated posture which is a meditative position with legs folded
Not downward dog or warrior pose or any of the hundreds of other poses
In the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, asanas (postures) are mentioned only around 3 times
The point of yoga is spiritual transformation not exercise
The 5000 year old breathing and meditation techniques are inceedibly powerful
No need for gymnastics - hence why they dont appear until 100 years ago
Yeah that really struck me when visited many years ago why there were so many Vietnamese given exactly what you mentioned
But totally makes sense given communism
No no, it is very serious
Maybe we could tell them that Sweden has lots of oil but lacks freedom and democracy
My father is American, my mother is Danish
I identify completely as Danish - I've never lived in the US, I don't feel at home in their culture, and though I speak English completely fluently, my accent isn't even particularly American-sounding
Ofc
having a parent from the US has affected my worldview, but in terms of identity, it really doesn't matter
I imagine it's actually more complicated when your parent is from a neighbouring country
Then you could realistically feel split
The US, however, is just too distant to be a tangible presence in my life
I am half Danish and half Faroese and I identify as both because I am proud that the am Danish and it is not every day people meet someone Faroese
Our fellow Nordic brethren are always welcome here in Denmark
I hope you like it here
In 1933 the Danish State minister Thorvald Stauning invited his political competitors and colleges, to his home, to negotiate plans to solve the financial crisis, after many ours of failed negotiations, the politicians where about to leave but Stauning invited them to stay for a glass of whiskey, and they manage to find a solution and the liberal partys agreed not stand in the way of the socialistic methods
The negotiations of Kanslergade is a canon-point in Danish history
I would say the English Wars and the Bombardment of Copenhagen in 1807
During the Napoleonic Wars, Denmark attempted to remain Neutral but the Great Powers of Europe had other ideas and the British invaded Denmark in an attempt to seize the Danish fleet
They succeeded after bombing the capital, after which Denmark surrendered the fleet
This removed the dominance of the Danish fleet in the Baltic - the Danish claim to fame - and it forced Denmark to choose a side in the Napoleonic Wars
When Denmark decided to spare the Germans in WW2
They were conquered twice just prior to this by Danish kings anyway, and that didn't last overly long
Norway was in an even worse position to hold onto it, so the presumption that it would've had any lasting impact is one hell of an assumption
Made me think of when I was young and on vacation in France
My dad would order "café espresso" and I was embarrassed, because I thought he was telling the waiter to hurry up
In Demark foreigners are apparently taught to say "goddag, hvordan har du det
" because that's what they all say and it sounds so strange
Noone else would say that here
Knock, knock
"Who's there
"To
"To, who
"It's *to whom*."
My uncle used to do it too
You say foreigners but in Danish it's also Beograd
Tolkien's Elvish was partially inspired on a sound-level by Welsh, but Elvish in the Witcher is literally just slightly garbled Welsh
The Elves call Geralt "Gwynbleidd", and *gwyn* is Welsh for "white", while *bleidd* is Welsh for "wolf". The Elven forest of Brokilon is clearly named after Brocéliande, which is a forest in the Arthurian mythos, Arthur being originally Welsh
I don't even understand what he's saying
Finnish city names are
Finnish
And that's bad
That just sounds like the typical "my culture is bland because I'm used to it", which pretty much everyone has to some extent
To me, Finnish sounds super exotic and interesting - as does, say Mandarin, yet of course to a native Mandarin speaker, there is nothing particularly fantastical about Xinjiang or Guangyuan
We just mix it up and pronounce it with a soft d instead
In a small country as Denmark, the middle of nowhere still exists
It would probably be most of northern Jutland, as soon as you get north of Aalborg and until Frederikshavn, you are literally in the middle of fucking nowhere
The coasts are nice tho
> I'd say that despite not being "in the middle" of anything
I'd say Danes typically operate with two different meanings of "middle of nowhere". Most of the time it really means "far from anything of note", and you could be surrounded by farms and it'd still be called *midden af ingenting*. That said, there are some places which are truly desolate
The area between Vrads and Christianshede is very, very empty
One of the few places where air-photos will show trees out to the horizon
I'd say that central Jutland south-west of Silkeborg is actually the most desolate-feeling region
That said, the military areas of Oxbøl are the only places I've wandered where you can go for miles and miles with genuinely *nothing*, just rain and moor and occasionally fake prop-buildings
As for Lolland, it has a different sort of feel to me
I think it's because it's *so* tilled and farmed and so densely settled that even though it is certainly "far from anywhere of note" it still looks totally tame
To put it this way: I can picture wolves throughout Jutland (in fact, I've seen one), but I cannot picture them on Lolland
Jutland is a mosaic of farmland, heaths, forests and small towns
Lolland is really all one big crop-field, often to the horizon
Large parts of Lolland don't even have species common in other parts of Denmark (like foxes and squirrels) because there is so little room for nature, even of the generalist sort
Dane here
I have noticed that child families move out of the city (Copenhagen) or to the outskirts of the city
When then kids get older they move to the big city to study, party etc
Nature here is boring, no dangerous animals, natural phenomenon or geography
The only sign ive seen that me slightly nervous was when driving next to a military area where artillery and tanks train
"what if they miss and shoot too far" briefly entered my mind
> Have you noticed the blood red stream
Do not worry, it happens from time to time
It's a natural occurrence"
Hol up
It’s not very big in Denmark/Sweden, which is a shame because it’s so much fun to play, and not as dangerous as many people think
And it’s way more fun to watch and play than football
Would love to play but there’s just no clubs around my home, which sucks
It's not really popular, which is funny, because Denmark's sports scene is quite wide, with lots of different sports getting a good amount of attention
The most popular being football and handball
Some other sports are beginning to rise quick, such as basketball
But not rugby
Of course
Personal experience is that I find cold eggs easier to handle when it comes to Danish meatballs etc, I don't know why
And warm milk fucking sucks
that depends on how the eggs are manufactured/treated in the packaging factory, some eggs are left "natural" they are less likely ro go bad outside the fridge, while those that are treated should be kept in the fridge
Eggs in Denmark are refrigerated, and we're part of the EU
And it seems a lot of your fellow Swedes in this comments section put them in the fridge as well
Where is this invisible divide
It seems from this thread to be a general North-South divide, with a northwestern crescent of fresh-milk drinking countries (from the Baltics through Scandinavia to Ireland) while Germany can go both ways, with the south beyond tending towards UHT
It occurs to me that I have mostly avoided drinking milk altogether while in the south, which, in hindsight, was perhaps rather fortunate
Pretty sure it's the same here
Forgot
Yea, that's what i'm talking about as well, the eggs are refrigerated in the stores as well
I don't know about the moisture of the eggs, cus i've never checked upon coming home, but buns that i buy are always damp when i come home
It says on the eggs from my local grocery store that they shouldn't be kept at anything above 12C, so that's why they put them in the fridge
In Denmark I have never been offered a doggybag, except at one Thai restaurant
A shame really, since the food will just be wasted
Here in Denmark, it's just not really a thing you do
They do not offer it as something you can do as you get ready to leave
You can ask, and I don't think it'd be frowned upon
But it is not a common thing
I honnestly think most people don't even realize you could do it
I wouldn't say it's frowned upon - personally I doubt I would do it
I always eat up, unless I really dislike the food
I remember once my dad "ordered" froglegs from a semi expensive restaurant that didn't take orders because it was his birthday, that was hilarious
With that being said I mostly eat in restaurants when I'm on vacation
I used both ANSI and ISO-DK
I can switch back and forth pretty easy
ANSI is preferred because it's better for programming and in general symbols are easy to type (imo)
I also made my own layout called [DWERTY] which is ANSI layout with "shortcuts" to Danish keys
Based off of [SWERTY]
Edit: Should point out OP that QWERTY and QWERTZ aren't the preferred way to tell keyboard layouts apart
[ ISO and ANSI are] ISO layouts have the vertical enter (ISO enter) and one more key than ANSI
ANSI is more or less US English layout, the Dutch Keyboard layout is also based off of this no ISO
It has a horizontal enter
ISO has variations for each local, Like ISO-DE, ISO-ES, etc
QWERTY with Å added after P and Æ,Ø added after L

<ZXCVBNM,.-
The Nordics have a shared keyboard layout, which is basically the same as English, but with "Å" "Ö/Ø" and "Ä/Æ" to the right of the "P" and "L". Since the layout is the same in all of the Nordics, and Swedish is the most used language in the Nordics, the Swedish letters are the biggest and the ones that are the same size as the other "regular" letters, with the Danish/Norwegian versions being smaller underneath the Swedish ones
At least this is the case on all the keyboards I've owned
[Example here]
I have several
One uses qwerty with a Danish layout, and another uses qwerty with a UK layout
I have also on occasion used a qwerty with another layout that was neither of the previous ones, but which I can't remember
Also Danish but with Æ Ø instead
That's really odd, because even on Danish keyboards you can make È without any trouble
For us it's pressing the [accent key] and then Shift + E.
You can also switch layout with win+space
I don't have the euro-sign on my 5-key on my keyboards
The euro-sign is only on alt-gr+e.
Thanks for making the post, I like keyboards :)
It always confuses the hell out of me, since we have both the Danish and Norwegian layout printed, and I can never remember which is which
I've recently had it pointed out by a New Zealander living in Denmark that this is something to do as well - after some consideration I realized the only times I ever touch my curtains, is if the sun bothers me
Tbh, when thinking about it, I realized it's simply because I don't care - if somebody looks into my apartment and sees me naked, what going to happen
At best they're going to see my boobs and not care about it, at worst they are going to see my boobs and get offended/excited by it
Either way, it doesn't affect me - after all, they are the ones peeking into other peoples houses, why should I care
Agreed, I also don't think that people look through windows in Denmark, it's kinda against our unwritten rules
We like our privacy
That's true - don't think I've ever caught people looking, nor ever looked myself
God it must be tough being young in Sweden
I resonate with this so much - though alcohol is certainly cheaper and more easy to acquire in Denmark than in Sweden, sharing at parties is a grey zone because it easily brings on the situation of who-gives-what and who-takes-what, that you mentioned
Certainly, Danes will always share their alcohol with you if you ask - some might even offer - but it'd be considered a big faux pas to take without asking or without having something to share of your own as well
We will accept it for a while if you don't, but if it's a clear pattern that you don't bring your own alcohol, Danes will start turning cold towards you (though likely not confront you directly, as that would be considered equally rude, instead you'd just be banned from the alcohol or the parties)
(There also a hieraki of which alcohols we do share - beers are seen as personal items only to be shared in dire situations, whereas mixers and spirits are often shared if asked)
I’ve caught people in a few instances, but they’re instantly embarassed
as they should be ;) must have been awkward for everybody, though
By now I live on the tenth floor so for me its neither here nor there, but growing up in a house in Jylland with my bedroom-window facing the street, I can imagine several people over the years have glanced at the house and looked into my room
Never caught anybody at it though
Yes and no - I'm 27 years old and most of my social group is late 20s to early 30s, and we still do the BYOB unless it's like a dinner party (and then we'll do what non-Scandinavians apparently do at regular parties, where everybody/most will bring at least something like a bottle of wine as a host-gift, which will then be used to drink at the dinner)
My parents don't really hold the "drinking-parties" anymore, but the few instances they have (meaning a party where it wasn't a formal, aka
invite in the mail and plan weeks ahead, kinda thing),  people would often drink a couple of beers ect
for themselves
I'd imagine it's exactly because it's cheap that beer and cider is personal - everybody should be able to afford it, plus its stable in any Danes diet  spirits, however, are an indulgence which not everyone can afford and are therefore more likely to be shared
Plus people have strong preferences in which beers they like, so it can't just be changed between people
Amongst friends money should never be an issue - but parties rarely involve only your friends, which is why the situation is as it is
With my friends I have a clear "I get this round, you get the next and if not - then surely its fine anyways
", however at a private party there'll be people who aren't my friends, either strangers or simply acquaintances
If these people were to ask me to have some of my alcohol at a party, likely I'd say yes because I'm there to be merry and make friends, but I'm not about to offer it up myself, because it's not my jobs to supply the whole party with drinks - everyone supplies for themselves, and then, if you want variety, you can share amongst you as you might wish
My friends would know they can just grab some of mine, as well as I know I can grab some of theirs - everybody else
They have to ask, it's simple
>A regular bottle of Beefeater 700ml will set you back 25 EUR
I can get one on sale in my local Føtex for 15 euro right now
>Bring it, but just expect others to also enjoy that gin
That would be really annoying
> In fact, people will often ask people to try their nice drink, so that they too can enjoy it
This, I can relate to
I like sharing and tasting someone else's nice drinks
I don't like to be the only one bringing a quality bottle and everyone would enjoy it, and than next time still bring cheap beers and drinks expecting me to bring another quality bottle
I have actually tried that
If it's expected anyone just can help themselves to your booze, than you just end up with a party, where everyone only bring cheap drinks and where's the fun in that (unless you are a teenager)
The fact that 2,8% beer exists in the first place is a crime against humanity
Is it treated as water by employers, in that it can be consumed in the workplace
Aha I wouldn't bat an eye to a construction worker drinking a regular beer
It is pretty cool tho, but I doubt it even has an effect when it only contains 0,4-0,5 units
We actually have a Christmas tradition of giving similarly alcoholic beers, mixed with lemon soda, to children, where I'm from
The most recent thing I can think of would be when king Christian X caused the Easter Crises by dismissing the government in 1920 without approval of parliament, in an effort to get approval for his plan regarding the reunification with Schleswig
Ironically this event was also what cost the Danish Monarchy the last bit of real political power that they had
All for the greater good
Can’t make an omelette without cracking a few Irish
Hah no, not at all
Its not atractive to be so white you might as well be transparent
Theres a reason we have different skincolors
Our skin has adjusted to the amount of sun we are exposed to
No color is unhealthy
I thought 70% humidity was normal
It's always between 50-100% here in Denmark
We have 92% humidity in my city right now
Which Saxony are we talking
I presume the one in eastern Germany
I think it’s seen as slightly weird here in the Nordics because it’s so expensive to eat at restaurants
The people I know that eat at restaurants the most use them maybe, maaaybe twice or thrice a month
In many other countries it seems like three times a week is not uncommon
Someone booking a three month trip to South America all alone is similarly seen as slightly weird by many
a lot of people who live alone, eat alone at home all the fucking time
why would it be weird to do so, in a restaurant ?
I think another reason it might be seen as slightly weird here in the Nordics is that it’s so expensive to eat at restaurants
The people I know that eat at restaurants the most use them maybe, maaaybe twice or thrice a month
In many other countries it seems like three times a week is not uncommon
Yeah, not happening here, unless you’re a millionaire
Same in Denmark, except it would maybe be a couple of Euros cheaper, but only a couple
I also said the people I know that use restaurants the absolute most - there’s a wide range before that
Only going to restaurants a couple of times *a year*  is not uncommon
Personally, I eat out maybe once every other month (excluding McDonald’s and such) and I think that’s pretty standard
No bail and no bounty - the government shouldn't potentially make money of their citizens being arrested, for very logical reasons
Nope
we do have rewards for turning in information, to the police, that can lead to the arrest of a few certain people in some situations, but it's rare
Same here in Denmark
But it's not like the rest of the world have big issues with people not showing up for court - I imagine the percentages are about the same tbh, no matter if you have bail or not
The "surety" is unnecessary if you have a court system and law enforcement system that functions the way it should
Depends on what you did
People who are considered a danger to society will be detained, others will be let go
If they are let go the judge, if needed, can make the call that police will pick them up on the day they are to appear in court
If not, they are simply expected to appear on your own
If you don't then you can be fined, and you are more likely to lose your court case, as you aren't present to defend yourself
I've seen news stories from the US where people pay several tens of thousands in bail
Are you telling me that's all administration and none of that but a small amount is left
Yes indeed, Danish ærtesuppe (like your erwtesoup) is amazing
Funny how we use so many similar words
More accurately, you promote the growth of lactic acid bacteria, that make the brine sour
This in turn protects against other bacteria, since they can't live in acid and salt solutions
Basically every country, where it was needed to preserve vegetables through winter does it
10, Denmark
Pretty impressive for being a so small country, I'm kinda proud
3 natural, 7 manmade
Here they are [
Note that 3 of them are in Greenland
Same
My entire family is atheist, but every time we went on any kind of vacation, we always went to a bunch of churches and temples
There's just something about it - like a calm and beauty that's hard to find elsewhere
They have covered every angle with the location:
UNESCO World Heritage Site, Ilulissat, Jakobshavn, Greenland, Denmark
I know
I have visited 9/10, of them
Thats pretty impressive :)
Sadly I am at 4, maybe 5 (if a quick childhood visit at Christiansfeld counts - basically I only remember the honeycake)
What food-related discussion is your country having
Like the French chocolatine vs pain au chocolate
In Denmark, koldskål is a yoghurt-thingy that’s popular to eat in the summer
You eat it with small biscuits called kammerjunker in
There are many [memes] about the best brand of koldskål, as well as whether you crush your kammerjunker or leave them in whole
Pork roast vs duck on Christmas is also big, although many do both
As well as chocolate buns vs [raisin buns]
Is the raisin vs chocolate buns really a debate
I cant think of a single instance where that was the topic of a discussion
You crush the kammerjunker
What kind of monster would eat them hole
Hummus with bare hands
Do we make the hummus wrong, because our hummus is way too thin to be eaten with bare hands
I’ve heard it quite a bit, although the others are bigger and the kammerjunker one seems to be the biggest
Raisin lovers get shamed big time (as they should)
I eat them whole as a side
Always found it so weird how most people dump them in the koldskål
I fucking love snails
They’re great
In the Camaque area I had them where you were supposed to dip them in chili mayo
Damn that's really intersting actually
I can't imagine that's the origin of the terrorist group Taliban
I am sorry what
Hedning
Country McCountryface
Danmark, the Danish name
It just fits better with the demonym "Dane".
Lego Land:OG edition
I want to change the name in Danish because if we say North Poland it means the North Pole which is confusing
I love the name Amelia, but I’m afraid it would be pronounced odd in my language
(Amalie is a very common name)
I really like the Spanish girls name “Dulcinea” which i first met in the book “Don Quixote”.
But i don’t actually think it’s a common name anywhere in general
Beautiful Chairs as well
With a name like that you can’t not be a Wizard
>Also, while we're at it, while googling for cool names we found Ganja on the list of popular scandinavian names
Wtf
Does anyone know someone called ganja
No, ganja means cannabis here
it's strange, because Sasha is by far mostly a girls name in Denmark
or Dick from Richard
He's lying lol
The polo logo is like synonymous with dads or posh young people
Logos all day everywhere you go
Clothes are clothes man
We're all living in western(ish) sicieties
There's your answer
Some do and some don’t
The only time i personally wear clothes with logos on is when i exercise
Otherwise never
Clothes with logos on is a big fashion no no in my book
Its ugly, its tacky and theres no need to advertise for a brand that tou paid so much money for
Same in Denmark, but just with Peak Performance jackets
I can't find any proof of Denmark relying heavily on German electricity, besides during the summer of 2018 where all the nordics had a shortage of electricity and had to import from elsewhere in europe
Far as I can tell we typically export wind energy to Germany as often as we import energy from them and generally rely more on importing energy from norway and Sweden when there's a lack of wind
Do you have any sources I could see
Because if that's the case, I would want to know
Until I learned differently I thought Athens was all the best parts of Rome (the old ones) just Greek instead
Controversial opinion, but it's a shame nuclear power has gotten such a bad rep
It's not what I want us to rely on forever, but using coal instead can't possibly be viewed as an improvement
The exchange of energy between the Nordic countries and with Germany is complicated stuff in general though, while looking up statistics I saw that during today alone Denmark has both imported from and exported energy to Germany
It switches back and forth all the time and is different for different parts of the country as energy generation and consumption fluctuates
In general our power grids are a lot more connected than I'd realized
I agree with everything, except the 'subtle' bit
It may come off as subtle to other Swedes, but dear Christ
It is *not* subtle
My guess is he was either a prick or from Sjælland
Jutland people are usually extremely humble, laid-back and self-deprecating people
*Usually
* But yeah, a lot of Scandinavian people are way too up their own asses about their countries
I frequently mention the Netherlands as a way more friendly place when people point out how friendly everyone in Scandinavian countries are, ironically, lol
It could be someone from Copenhagen
Southern and mid - Sjællændere are more reserved in my experience, though Jutes are very nice people
Scandinavia use "son/søn/sen" which just means "son of"
I'll find it quite saddening how many of the Scandinavian people will switch to english when speaking to people from other countries, we can understand 99% of what other Scandinavians say, it's just easier to speak English
I’m annoyed that a simple constructed language isn’t used instead, so nobody would have that native speaker advantage
I like being multilingual
I just hate that I switch between American and British English
Actually can’t wait for the Germans broadly to become kinda good at it
That will hopefully result in the German language being less of a necessity to learn in the eyes of the schools and ministry
(Can’t say most of us enjoy having to be taught 2 additional languages)
Yeah I think it’s a Scandinavia thing
Scandinavian languages are quite close to English actually
No, that's what makes danish such a powerful language, it is a language, impossible to learn for foreigners, making only those worthy of it able to speak the language
This
Almost everybody loved English, because everybody found it easy and sometimes you watched cool movies, while German/French was everyone’s hate subject
Didn't understand a single word but agreed
Germany
Whaaaaat, noooo
We'll do it again ;)
When the Øresund freezes we are gonna come
just after we are done getting ourselves stupidly drunk
So give it back
You’ve had it long enough
We'll welcome you back into the kingdom with open arms, although we might get a small problem doing the same Halland and Blekinge
Well if so
be ready to party like its 1520 ;)
I get why
Danish isn't easy to learn
Speaking depends on what area you are in or who you speak to
And then there's one dialect
I won't bother trying
Good thing though, most can speak english, so shouldn't be a nightmare to visit
Hope it does
You're both right
It's a matter of semantics
The German dialects are considered dialects of one language because of politics
It's the same reason but opposite case of why Croatian and Serbian or Hindi and Urdu are *not* considered the same language
In the latter case, they are basically identical, sometimes hardly even dialectally distinguished, but considered separate because their speakers won't deign to be conflated with each other
In German's case, all the dialects are considered one language despite often not even being mutually intelligible, for the sake of enforcing the narrative of German unity
Danish, Norwegian and Swedish are at least as similar to each other as many German dialects, yet are considered different languages
In another timeline, one with a single country called Scandinavia, they would all be considered dialects of Scandinavian
You are talking about the state of Saxony
Standard German is an mixture of Alemannic (or High German) dialects
Saxon is one such dialect, but that is because the present-day state of Saxony (after which the Saxon dialect is named) has taken its name from Old Saxony (now Niedersachsen)
German terminology is confusing on countless levels, but for simplicity, Low German = (Low) Saxon (of Anglo-**Saxon** fame) = Ingvaeonic
These are the people Charlemagne was mean to
Old Saxony ≠ Modern Saxony/Sachsen and the dialect of modern Saxony (Upper Saxon) ≠ true Saxon
Having written it out, that doesn't look simple at all
Low German is an entirely different language than all dialects of High German, which didn't influence Standard German and which is more closely related to English and Frisian
Somewhere along the line, you have misunderstood something
I'm trying to figure out where
OP said
> It actually is its own language
It developed from Saxon which is Ingvaeonic/North Sea Germanic unlike German which comes from Irmionic/Elbe Germanic
He was *explicitly* referring to the North-Sea Saxons, the Ingaevones, that is, the Low Saxons
The Electorate of Saxony has nothing to do with them, expect the name, and the modern-day state (and dialect, Upper Saxon) are located in, and descend from, *that* Saxony, not the one OP was referring to
Kursachsen is the direct predecessor of the state of Saxony, and you need only [skim the Wikipedia article] to confirm as much
Looking at a map would achieve much the same
You were responding to OP, who was talking about Low German, which is what this entire conversation was about
u/Bl0odwork_ said he spoke Low German, u/ninjaiffyuh elaborated that Low German was actually its own language, descended from Saxon, and thus unrelated to Standard German, which is High German
Then *you* stepped in, claiming that Saxon was actually related to Standard German, by saying, and I quote:
> Maybe down a very long road, but High German today is an artificial mix that evolved in **Saxony** and the merchant cities of south Germany
Now that is true, except *that* Saxony is the Electorate of Saxony, which is not what OP was talking about
Nobody spoke Low German in Kursachsen, so either you conflated Low Saxony and Kursachsen, or you randomly brought up a different part of the country with no relevance to the conversation whatsover
Which was it
As for that guff about "true" Saxony, I was quite transparently referring to the place the [Saxons] actually came from - that is, Low Saxony
All the other Saxonies are named *after* that Saxony, so if "the original Saxony" would have pleased you more, then let's go with that
But the conversation wasn't about High German
Everybody else has expressed confusion at your posts
But no, it's the children who are wrong
What’s your country’s hard-to-swallow pill
Scandinavians and Dutchmen like to feel clever and on a high horse because of our high English proficiency, however we conveniently forget that we’re literally the languages that are closest related to English *in the world*.
I recently looked a bit on Korean grammar and there’s nothing intuitive about it
At all
It’s an entirely different way of thinking while speaking
Meanwhile I could guesstimate a lot in English
I imagine a lot of Europeans can’t, because English is so different from their native language
Secondly, “the Nordic welfare model” is kinda overblown
Lots of countries have free healthcare and 30 days vacation and paid university, they’re not all Nordic
I feel this one
Towards who
Spanish and Italian are very big languages
Dutch is also somewhat big but the Scandinavian languages has 6 million, 4 million and 10 million speakers respectively
I like how the rest of Scandinavia refers to this as “the Nordic/Scandinavian model”, while Sweden refers to this as “the Swedish model”
I was genuinely shocked when I learnt that the US has a higher GDP per capita than us
Yet we have free university, healthcare, and just generally higher standards of living for the general populace
Not at all hating on the US in general, but your system needs a serious overhaul
Some of us find that accent endearing and even quite sexy
Norway exporting hydro-power means that other countries can decarbonize their electricity generation
So overall it's better for the climate
You should do it even more, as Norwegian hydro is the only inexpensive way to deliver flexible, cheap, and low-carbon electricity
who cares about poles anyway tbh
Ah, you sort of just pretend to be
Obviously, it depends on the person's voice, manner of speaking, etc
, as it would with any accent, but yes, German accents can definitely be endearing or sexy
Sure, it's not going to decarbonize Europe as such
But with the expansion of wind-energy in the North Sea, Norway is going to export more hydro and import more wind
no one really
Not to be rude but what's the relevance
It might geographically be further away, but we speak the language and are familiar with the culture(s), so I'd not say that California is far and exotic, no
But it isn't two words in Swedish
It is, its "Medeltiden" meaning the middle time or the middle age
the Scandinavian languages all compound words are always written without space in between
That's why you can basically make infinitively long words in our languages
For example, the longest word recorded in public records in danish is "speciallægepraksisplanlægningsstabiliseringsperiode" meaning (roughly) specialist doctor practice planning stabilisation periode
But said in, and considered, a single word
Finland doesn't count as a Scandinavian country
At least in Scandinavia it doesn't.
I don't know anything about the Finnish language though
Its quite far removed from any of the Scandinavian languages
You'll have to ask a Finn about that :)
Nordic, yes
Scandinavian, no
Well they're currently making Assassins Creed: Valhalla
That was the one a lot of my friends wanted since the beginning
I've never been a big fan though, they seem awfully buggy
Don’t mix Danish viking history with Norwegian
Such a bummer that we can’t go to Denmark, yet the vikings in england were danish
Well, they're doing Valhalla now
So that's my country
Maybe it would be interesting to see a game set during The Great Northern War which was basically Sweden vs
Russia, Denmark and Poland-Lithuania
They kinda are, and I would've chosen exactly the period, so I'm happy
Yes
And fun fact, in Denmark we currently have a late night show who does a televisef christmas show with a new episode each day (traditionally called a televised christmas calendar)
Each day they drink a new christmas beer, but since the entirety of the show is recorded within 6 hours they just become more and more drunk with each episode
It’s the 2nd time they’re doing it, but I see it becoming a tradition to watch for adults
Huh, same thing here, in regards to Die Hard
Randers Boys, if you see a scooter speeding down the highway and they're drinking Mokai, they're probably from Randers
Bumser
People from Tønder
We have something called Jyder
Jyder
I heard chungos as well
Don't know if that's catalan though
Yeah or Brians
Brăila*
And Amagermanden
I can smell an københavner or fynbo
Oj, skal vi slås?
Sjælland is at least as Brian as our worst areas
or those from Vestegnen
We had a kind of folk rock but that scene is still very popular today
Danish popular music was also very much inspired by British and American music at the time
No doubt the most popular band in the period was [Gasolin]
In the 70's you had a lot of music inspired by Bob Dylan, jimi Hendrix and the hippie movement as well as more mainstream rock
[Sebastian] [Skousen & Ingemann] were heavily inspired by American rock and folk for instance
Parallel to this, there was a strong schlager tradition from the 70s up until today which in Danish is called Dansktop music
Artists like Birthe Kjær, Johnny Reimer and Peter Belli
In the 80s there were more pop music, and artists like [Lis Sørensen] [Anne Linnet] and the pop bands [Gnags] and [TV2] were very popular
The general trends in American and British music, like disco, reaggae, new wave etc also influenced Danish music
This is so completely random
I read this comment, and then all of a sudden the guy on the radio [presented this new band] who are inspired by Anatolian psych rock
What are the odds
In the 80's there were also bands like, TV2, Kliche and Gnags
Well there is Gasolin who every dane loves, there is shubidua and there's Kim Larsens solo project
those were the most popular from that time that people still love today:)
EDIT: the song det bedste til mig og mine venner is my favorite from Gasolin
death machine definetely has a darker Sound than the bands i've mentioned
But to me, they Do have a bit of a similar feel
I can understand Norwegian
But Swedish to me is Russian
I can have a pretty decent conversation with a Norwegian guy, and also a basic conversation with a Swedish guy
German
I suck at german️
I'm a french and have been living in damnmark for 5 years now
Once I correctly read a few sentences in Swedish without realising it, so that's enough to convince me that the languages are really similar
> "Hyggjeleg" also sounds like the Icelandic word "Huggulegt", which means "cozy".
[*Danish influence intensifies*]
It isn't thing anymore but we had something called "radbrækning" you get whipped for 9 weeks, after that you get every bone broken either starting from the neck and down or from your toes and up
When that's done you would be weaved into a wooden wheel, put on a stick and left for the birds to eat you
We make our victims step on LEGO
We have a whole island called "amager" which is where people where taken to be executed by decapitation - it's now a part of Copenhagen
some people still use the term "amager halshug" (Amager decapitation) which is a way of saying "i swear, i'm telling the truth"
I honestly have no idea what the Danish way of killing would be
If someone knows please comment below mine, I am interested to know
Don't forget there where the whole burning people alive because they might be witches
If you learn a second language, part of learning that language means learning their culture and history - f.ex
when learning German we have history in German class where we are taught German history in the German language
The same is (should be) done in all other foreign languages in the Danish school system
But that's the closes you get to it
We have English from the second year (this is a newer thing, I first had it as a subject in the fourth year) and German from the sixth, but we get German so late that most people (me included) never really catch on
Danish is of course the main language
Then we learn english and either french or german
And that is standard and mandatory
And thats from you're like 13
Det skulle du helst have haft hvert år gennem hele folkeskolen :)
Ja, jeg skrev en opgave under min kandidat om inddragelsen af svensk og norsk i danske folkeskoler og gymnasier og det er meget almindeligt enten aldrig at have haft det eller kun et par gange eller en enkelt gang i folkeskolen
Men rent officielt skal vi have det hver år vi har dansk gennem hele folkeskolen, plus i gymnasiet hvis man læser på STX eller HF
Desværre overholdes det slet ikke - det er det samme i Norge og Sverige
Gennem vores Skandinavisk samarbejdpolitik skal vi alle undervises i hinandens sprog, men ingen af os bliver det rigtigt - det er en af grundene til vi har meget sværere ved at forstå hinanden nu end f.eks
vores forældre og bedsteforældre havde
Aint that the truth
Det var også det vi kom frem til i vores opgave da vi talte med undervisere
I folkeskolen er det mere fordi underviserne ikke mener det er nødvendigt/interessant og selv føler det er noget de ikke kan finde ud af
Haha nej, det behøver du i hvert fald ikke ;)
Altså nu er min far skolelærer (dog i specialklasse, men alment uddannet som dansk og historie lærer - de samme to fag jeg selv læste på uni sjovt nok) og han var i hvert fald 100% dygtigere til dansk end jeg var i 3
g og hele vejen gennem både min bachelor og kandidat kunne jeg bruge ham som støtte i begge fag
De har jo også haft STX eller tilsvarende, plus flere år med fagene intensivt på seminarium
Men, alligevel tror jeg nu det kommer meget an på underviseren når det kommer til stykket
Greenland and the Faroe Islands like to say they work towards independence
But that is to avoid the EU
I don't think there are, unless you count Greenland as being part of Denmark
Sort of
There are active independence movements in both Greenland and the Faroes, especially Greenland
On the one hand, they have a lot of political momentum behind them
On the other hand, it is completely economically unfeasible, and I'm not sure the Danish government would even accept a sudden unilateral declaration
So are they close
Well, I can quite easily imagine a scenario in which the Greenlandic government succeeds in running a populist campaign for independence, then promptly collapses the economy
It'd be stupid as hell, but it could well happen
We have Greenland and the Faroe Islands
I don’t know how severe it is tho
Greenland is mostly self governing, except for Denmark providing a direct yearly subsidy equal to roughly 25% of their gdp
How is Cornwall different
They are not in the EU
The reason they are not independent is more for economic reasons
Couldn't hunting and wild life laws not just be managed by the individual län?
This Frenchman speaks the truth
>They are not in the EU
That was basically the first thing they decided and one of the main things behind the wish to have self-government
A Danish viking, [Rorik] did rule over parts of Friesland in the 9th century
"Boyfriend" and "girlfriend" are both *kæreste* (dearest)
"Tax" and "treasure" are both *skat*. It's also used as a term of endearment
"Poison" and "married" are both *gift*.
Gender: køn
Cute: køn
Nice: køn
Edit: Convent and monestery are Kloster in Danish
"Pigeon" and "dove" are both called "due". To this day, I don't actually know what the difference between a pigeon and a dove is (i.e. why is it a turtle dove and not a turtle pigeon, and why is it a crowned pigeon and not a crowned dove)
A newt and a salamander are also both just called "salamander" in Danish
Several animals:
Abe: ape and monkey
Pindsvin: porcupine and hedgehog
Blæksprutte: octopus and squid
&#x200B;
I was watching an animal show the other day with my girlfriend and it was the first time it ever occurred to her that a squid and an octopus were too different things in English
Can't think of any rn, but there are lots the other way around
Both Submarine and U-Boat are just Ubåd.
Boyfriend and girlfriend is both kæreste
So in reality, you could have a kurkku in your kurkku
Same in Danish, I love it
I love how kæreste is just so simple
In most languages I’ve come across it has some awkward double meaning that can be misunderstood, like how in English a girlfriend can be a female friend, and in German a friend and a girlfriend is both Freundin etc
Yeah, it's a bit unfortunate
But because one's a noun and one's a verb, you can always tell which one is being used due to the sentence structure
*Skat* (tax) and *skat* (treasure) are both nouns, so they're much more interchangeable and good for puns
With *gift* you might have to do some grammatical finagling to get a pun to work
Yeah, it's definitely unambiguous as far as the status of the relationship is concerned
The gender neutral aspect is quite fun, too
Now I have an image in my head of some guy called Scott handing in his tax-free forms at the airport to get the VAT refunded on his Royal Copenhagen souvenir plate .
But that's super interesting
I always love learning about new etymological links, so thanks for sharing
Yeah
A cloister is a korsgang (cross hallway) in Danish  and korsgång in Swedish :)
The rats with wings that live in cities and shit on sculptures are pigeons indeed (feral domestic pigeons which are descended from rock pigeons if we have to get technical), but there are hundreds of other species like the ones I mentioned, and I can't make sense of why some are "doves" and some are "pigeons". Turtle doves aren't white for example
Not exactly
A U-boat is a boat that sails above water but has the ability to dive
A submarine is a boat that sails under water
Almost nothing i care about, is covered in Danish
Sure, there's a tiny bit
but it's SO much easier to find gaming related websites (for example) in English
only danish sites i visit are computer related or related to regular news
On places like youtube, i dont follow any danish channels
It has always been like that for me
My games, my TV shows and movies are for the most part, english, and i've been a gamer since the late 80s.
I've even chosen to install english language on my computers windows, just because it's easier to solve problems and follow a little step by step guide etc, without having to translate as i go
I believe it's like this for most other people around my age (i'm in my mid 30s)
also, i've been taught english in school since 4th grade and more and more english is being springled into our language
We don't dub
English lessons start around 7
We get almost all of our entertainment from English speaking countries
English is a Germanic language, such as our own
The vikings affected the Ebglish language greatly, many English words come directly from the vikings
Compared to Germany we hardly translate or dub anything really
I wholeheartedly support learning to hear English and read local subtitles early
Otherwise, you end up being *that* person who chooses to take a child to the cinema to watch a Narnia film with English audio and local subtitles and whisper-reads the subtitles OUT LOUD to said child
Don't be that person or you *will* get very loudly and passive-aggressively shushed
At what grade and age do you start having English lessons
In Denmark we begin at first grade, age 7
> traveling, language exchanges
Not even slightly necessary
My hometown, then nationality (Danish)
I don't really identity myself with the danish regions (Jutland, Zealand etc) but that is mainly because my father is from Zealand and my mother is from Jutland
I have lived roughly 1/3 of my life in the town I was born, 1/3 in Copenhagen and 1/3 where I live now
So I don't really identify with the city or the area where I live
The order is probably: Danish > Scandinavian / Nordic > Northern European > European
I don't identify myself with any of that
Only thing I identify with is my social circle
r/Europe moment
Is Parmesan an Italien region or do you just really like cheese
All i had to play with growing up was a dirty rock and the tears in my eyes
&#x200B;
Just kidding, it was usually video games or football with friends
Squirrel
Seriously it can't be said correctly
It's a cute but unspeakable animal
Most people I know pronouce "three" as twee or tree
I generally cannot pronounce words with z correctly and say it with an s instead
Zone is sone and the like
If I make a buzzing sound for a few seconds (bzzz) I can say the z but it comes out really exaggerated
Megalomaniacal is a fun, seven-syllable rollercoaster
Don't some British pronounce *hate* like the standard pronunciation of *height*?
I was first thinking Finland
I was on a student exchange there a few years ago, and I felt completely like home
Obviously that isn't too far away though, so I was going to say maybe Japan next, although Denmark and Japan are probably just similar in a few ways
I don’t know if it counts as far away, but The Netherlands feels like a brother from another mother
Flat terrain, bad weather, lots of bikes and pretty free spirited people
Sometimes their language even looks like broken Danish
Australia or at least Melbourne felt very familiar for some reason
The people and the vibe felt like summer in Copenhagen
I think Australians and Danes are similar in many areas
New Zealand
It is on the complete opposite side of the world, but I feel their relaxed mentality and informal workplace attitude is just very similar to here in Denmark
Population is around the same size as well, but they of course have waaay cooler nature
Dutch is what they speak in Denmark right, the capital of Sweden
Melbourne is a bit of an outlier though
I lived in Australia for about a year, and they are generally much more conservative, old-fashioned and religious than we are when you get outside of Melbourne and Sydney
I would say New Zealand is much closer to how we are
You don't like
Can't all sound beautiful like italian
Ever since I saw this video, I have been compelled to visit
Seems like such a nice place
I think you're overestimating the effect English is having on smaller European countries
As long as the state enforces the national language in schools, bureaucracy and national media, our languages are in no danger
It's the smaller dialects and minority languages that are going to die out as more and more people assimilate to the main dialect or language
But I'm talking about a language surviving as the main tongue of the majority of the population, not the supremacy of said language in every field
Speaking as a Dane, our film industry have always struggled and primarily survived on state funding
It's true that English material is being consumed to a greater degree than before, but I think that is just an effect of more people being able to understand it
I would actually say that some of the best and most succesful Danish movies have been made in the last 15 years
Are there no domestic movie making about Ireland at all
I thought the Irish government were big on supporting Irish culture
That's interesting, but yeah it probably boils down to language
Danish Movies are a big part of pop culture here
What is the most unique landscape you have near where you live
I actually live close to two - the Wadden Sea, the worlds biggest tidal flats, with imense  biodivercity
Just above the Wadden sea, we along the west coast - we get sand dunes
And I believe it was about 200 years ago, to stop the sand dunes from blowing everywhere - they planted the area with a special strong grass types and pine trees
This creates this unique looking landscape
On top of the landscape being very unique, the wildlife is super interesting too
Being a big area, actually owned by the military - few people other than people in their summerhouses live here
Which makes it ideal for animals
We have one of the biggest populations of deer, where it is not uncommon to see herds of 70, even 100 deers just grassing next to the road
As Denmark has no natrual predators bigger than the fox (We got perhaps like 6 wolves now, but that is far from enough to do anything) the deer simply live in peace
And the ones in this area, are so used to tourists, they don't give a damm
So you can often get so you are only a few meters  from them before they run off
&#x200B;
Edit some pictures: [Wadden sea] B[irds at the Wadden Sea]
[The overgrown sanddunes] [An other image of the overgrown sanddunes with pine trees] [Deer walking in the nature]
Nice post - I'm sorry if I'm being pedantic, but we do have a larger predator than the fox, even if we don't count the wolves that have been coming back in the recent years
The badger is normally regarded as the biggest Danish land-predator (even though it mostly just eats worms, grubs and insects)
The grey seal is of course even bigger, we don't usually count that as a land predator
Neither badgers, gray seals or foxes are of course as you mentioned, no threat for the deers
Not the most unique thing here, but I live in Sønderborg right down by the water of “Flensburg Fjord” so I can see Germany from my window
I've never heard of this but it sounds really cool
Thanks for telling about it
That looks so cool
I've visited the petrified forest in Arizona, but that is very different from this
That Blue lake looks intense
Thank you for sharing
That looks stunning
That looks really special
Thank you for sharing this
Looks like a wine lovers dream to go here
I goggled  Burren  and that looks so special
That's amazing
This looks really cool
And I got a fondness of the Romans
So, would love to come see one day
I've driven past this area once
It is incredible
Did not stop and get out though
I should next time
I am so jealous of mountains, I love mountains
This place looks to beautiful
Yees we have this too
It can be very beautiful
The sanddunes goes straight into heartland as well
When the lavender blooms, it is so pretty
Denmark is in a very similar position actually
200 years ago about 80%-90% of Jutland was heathland
Now nearly all of it is fields
Which country is this
That looks amazing
Thank you for sharing
That's so cool
Thanks for sharing
Denmark is also very flat
Most of it is just fields, and flat areas
So, having this nature by the sea is a huge relief, and the fact I live by the sea, or else I'd go insane if I couldn't be in beautiful nature
That is how it always is haha
Gotta lure in the tourists
Wao that's soo cool
I want to go here now
Do you have any roman ruins near by
For if you do, perfect holiday location to go to for me (I got a Roman obession haha)
That is a pitty
But do you know why they plant the tress though
Yep
I'm going
This is so cool
Thank you for telling about this location
Interesting
What a drama that is honnestly
But thank you for telling me about this
Here we make huge pine tree plantations, because of our Christmas trees
Which we basically supply the whole north with
But we never have forest fires here
So, it's not that bad
We've used Teams from the get-go but I'm back in physical school now
We have had physical school since april, and will/are having physical exams
However, only the students on their last year are currently in school, so school's much more empty than usual
Also, some exams are cancelled, so we only have 3
But tbh, compared with what most of the rest of the world is going through with quarantine and restrictions, social life being slightly restricted, my daily life is not all that different from before
Good ol' Middelfart
In Denmark, we have Tarm which translates to intestine, Sæd which translates to Semen, København/Copenhagen which translates to Buy A Harbor (Køb En Havn), Århus which is Year House, Aalborg which is Eel Castle, and finally the infamous Middelfart which is hilarious to foreigners
We also have an app called Fartkontrol which means Speed Control that tracks speed traps in traffic
EDIT: Sengeløse (bedless), Vanløse (waterless), Stenløse (stoneless)
We have middelfart
"Lem" - Limb = Penis
"Tarm" - Intestine
"Sæd" - Semen
And many others
All of the above, and all the other weird city names, are from The west part of Denmark called Jylland (Jutland)
* Lem (Penis)
* Sæd (Semen)
* Middelfart (Is funny in english)
* Røved (Røv means Ass)
* Tørskind (Litterally translates to "Dryskin")
* Hørmested (Hørm means to smell bad/foul, sted means place
* Helved (Means Hell)
* Pikhede (Penis heat)
* Sædballe (Semen butt)
* Bøsserup (Fag ville)
* Knepholt (Knep means to fuck, holt sounds like "Halt
* Snave (Tongue kissing)
* Karens Klit (Karens Clit)
We got two cities fairly close to one another called Tarm and Lem
Their names respectively can be translated to scrotum and penis
We have Middelfart
It’s not that weird in our language, but for the English speakers, it’s somewhat funny :)
We have a town called Sæd which means sperm
Denmark:
Hørmested: "Smelly Place"
Mygdal: Mosquito Valley
Tarm: Intestine
Balle: Buttock
Which is placed right after the city 'Hoed': Head
Mosbjerg: Moss Mountain
In Denmark you have the ocean called Kattegat
Kattegat can mean "Cat's butt"
[Copenhagen/Great Copenhagen train stations directly translated ]
Mørke (Darkness)
Not to forget
Lem: other word for penis
Lemvig: penis Bay
Tisvilde: pee wild
Skygge: shadow
Bøvl: a huge bother
Krummerup: crumb town
Rungsted: now a place where Rich people live, but the name originated from old words for pigsty
Jeg ville satme ikke kunne bo i Hørmested
Det ville være flovt at skrive sin adresse
Instead it just means ''Beech Cheek'' (Cheek as in butt-cheek)
Jeg har familie der bor der
Det er egentlig en hyggelig lille by, men ja, navnet er dælme uheldigt
I haven't seen Vikings so I wont know but it is an ocean that lies between Norway, Sweden and Denmark, so it is very likely
The only thing that comes to mind is the huge Fireworks Explosion accident in Kolding in 2004 which only killed 1 person however so there maybe is worse accidents
Probably the [firework disaster in seest ] atleast that’s what I remember as being the worst
Luckily not many were injured or killed, but the disaster took out a whole lot of that town
[here’s a video]
Milan airport disaster
A few years ago a truck carrying beer hit an oncoming train and shredded 8 people almost beyond recognition
The accident happened bacause the cargo wasn't tied down properly, so it just fell right into the side of the front car
Also, many years ago a new, fast train had it's maiden voyage
A lot of passengers where on it when it crashed and tipped to the side
It was never talked about a lot back then, the passengers (including kids) who lost their loved ones were told to just get over it
The train crash on Storebælt 2 January 2019
8 killed
You made me nose exhale, thank you, good sir
I’ve had 6 deaths within 7 years, two of them quite tragic
God never entrede my mind once
I began meditation though With a purely spiritual not religious purpose
>	I'm an atheist
>	Heaven is what I picture as a sanctuary of the dead
I am confused
It's immediately apparent as soon as people say that, that have never visited Sweden
God I've had that one as well
For some reason people seem to think that out of 5
6 million people I would know their one friend
No, not a single snowflake has been spotted this year
It was very hard for me to get into any form of Christmas spirit this year
It just didn't really feel like Christmas at all
"This year" its been like this for atleast 5 years
I would say this[ photo from the migrant crisis of 2015]
[Christian X riding across the old border in 1920] after [Schleswig's reunification with Denmark] There's also the photograph of [the King riding through occupied Copenhagen] as a contender
What's that on her head
How is she alive if her head was pierced through
You just want to rub it in, how many wars and landmass we’ve lost
Not cool man
I'm thinking countries smaller than and maybe including Luxembourg
Once in the train I heard a woman speak a language I didn’t recognise in any way
It was the most beautiful thing I’d ever heard
I have absolutely no idea what it was though, and I don’t think I’ve heard it since
Ayee
Unfortunately, regular danish is potato danish
Even the Welsh are mocking us now lol
> "Even the Danes don't understand Danish"
*googles Welsh
> Only 29% of Welsh people are able to speak Welsh
Lol
Erik af Pommern was born in Darlowo  and was king of Denmark from 1396-1439
We technically had a Pomeranian regent, although he was just for show and was loyal to queen Margheth the first
It would've been very common when most countries were still considered monarchies I think
I mean just look at personal unions within my own country: Denmark-England, The Kalmar Union, Denmark-Norway, Denmark-Schleswig, Denmark-Holstein, Denmark-Saxe Lauenburg, Denmark-Iceland etc
Etc
I thought the german noble was thrown out and replaced with a Danish prince, whose line continued (with a break) until you removed monarchy for good
Christian I (1448-1481) was also foreign-born
He was before Christian I, though
That Iceland was still under danish rule
Back in second grade or so, a substitute teacher insisted that when X > Y, it actually means Y is bigger
English teacher saying that a cheetah was called "gepard" in English
Since that is the Danish word for cheetahs
My teacher teacher tried to tell me once that Colombus discovered 'Murica, despite the fact that we're living in the country that actually did
It was in 1937
Here's the radio press release:
And it was in reaction to the Dutch fascist party who kept claiming red was orange
the issue of course is as well that gymnasium means something different depending on the country - even though we all use the term
In Denmark, for example, it's basically our version of sixth form for the smarter kids (we're there from around 16 to 19), whereas in Germany it's for much younger smarter students, and is more like secondary
It can really create some confusion when you use the term across borders, because the different systems have very different ideas of what a gymnasium is
>	How did they managed that
When a mama German and a papa German love each other very much ...
It's called holy three kings day/eve (helligtrekongersdag/aften), but it hasn't been a holy day/holiday since 1770
Apparently, a few small islands still have some local traditions
In Denmark, we don´t really do anything
Well, i did, it was my 18th birthday, and it snowed
But not anything else, i dont reckon
Probably "De higer og søger
I gamle bøger" roughly "They long and seek
In old books" from the poem "The Golden Horns" 1802 by [Adam Oehlenschläger] who also wrote the lyrics to our national anthem
The poem is about the [Golden Horns of Gallehus] written shortly after the horns were stolen from the National Museum, and sadly melted down
I would say:
"I Danmark er jeg født, der har jeg hjemme, der har jeg rod, derfra min verden går."
Translation: "In Denmark I am born, there I have home, there I have root, from there my world goes
By H. C. Andersen
One of my personal favorites is from Holberg's play "Jeppe på Bjerget" (["Jeppe on the Hill"] in English) a comedic play from 1722
In short, the play is about the drunkard peasant who gets drunk and fall asleep on a dung hill
The Baron and his men find him, and decide to pull a prank on him
They dress him in the Baton's clothes, place him in the Baron's bed, and play along as if Jeppe is the Baron when he wakes up
Upon waking the bewildered Jeppe asks himself (contemporarily rephrased):
>Drømmer jeg, eller er jeg kommet i himmerrige
In English:
>Am I dreaming, or have I entered into heaven/paradise
The play has it's more serious sides, showing how Jeppes wife beats and abuses him, which gives the second famous quote:
>De siger Jeppe drikker, men de siger ikke *hvorfor* Jeppe drikker
In English:
>They say Jeppe is a drunkard, but they don't say *why* Jeppe is a drunkard
walk onto the bike paths
seriously, noone walks there and there are big bike pictures - how hard can it be to understand
another thing is using taxis
one thing is that they are very expensive, another is that public transport will get you everywhere much easier and cheaper
Don't step out on the bicycle paths
And this is from a Dane, who has nearly crashed so many times exactly because of this
Viset the little mermaid in copenhagen, your gonna get disapointed
Visit
Only two vowels more
This is my rule of thumbs, regarding any swedish people
My clothes right now are literally black, grey and blue
Can confirm
dutch beer is a joke :(
I always tell foreigners here that they should regard the bike paths as roads or highways
For them a designated bike path is like a leisurely trail, where you can stop up to gawk at a map or maybe have a sip of water
There are simply too many bikes here trying to get to their destination to be able to do that
Either bike or get of the road
12 min/ 10 km in a taxi is 200kr
Lets make a deal: You stay away from the sidewalk, we stay away from the bike paths
that's what the bell is supposed to mean
Like pant in Denmark, I guess
It's not empty forming, and the bikes will go through you rather than around
On the bright side, if you're American you get to experience a free ambulance ride and will probably get your broken leg fixed for free because no one in hospital will have the slightest idea of how you can even charge for that kind of thing
>I mostly remembered to stay out of the bike lane, but sometimes I forgot
And then: Suddenly you remembered
of course the bike paths are next to the pedestrian paths; they are, however, on an entirely different level and made with asphalt instead of tiles
haha and you cant see anything anyways cause it's filled with tourists taking pictures for some reason
Talking loud and taking shoes off in someone's home are the same here in Denmark tho
So Denmark
I can understand if it's hard to tell what is a bike path and what is a pedestrian street on the countryside, but in Copenhagen they are clearly marked and look [like this] with every single pedestrian *not* walking on the lower-leveled, bike-marked path full of bicycles
when in Rome do as the romans
yeah
I ''saw'' the Starry night in New york
There were so many people, you couldn't see anything, and the painting was so small and in far away
Huh, that's weird
Altho the rest of Denmark views those 2 cities (especially Copenhagen) as the more entitled cities
Where I'm from (mid-west Jutland) people who talk loudly are usually told to shut the fuck up
the blue ones are only in the very center of Copenhagen (guess they got too tired of tourists not getting the point), whereas my example is in the entirety of Copenhagen as well as other larger danish cities
the 60 km/h sign is for cars, not sure why they're always placed all the way on the other side
Here in Denmark, it's a guilty pleasure
We have long tradition for super nice design so naturally there's a lot of hate for IKEA -mass produced and not always super nice design
However, everybody have furniture from there and to some  love it for it's super down to earth functionality and cheap price
And of course the restaurant is a place for itself
Same in Denmark
Although their kitchens are surprisingly good quality, compared to the other "off the shelf" kitchens you can buy here
Maybe I’m a filthy Copenhagener but I would say it’s seen as the standard
A little flimsy, sure, but not *bad*. I think every household has some ikea items
I think it's a matter of where you are in life and your economic situation
Many young people are fine with ikea furniture, but once you've got a couple of higher quality pieces in your home, ikea's does feel a bit flimsy
Still decent quality for the price tag, but not compared to better (but more expensive) pieces
How dare you
TAKE BACK SKÅNE
[FIGHT]
Honestly, I'm not aware enough of the political implications and diplomatic relationships that are probably (hopefully
) nurtured through these bases
However, the only American base within the Kingdom, that I know anything about, is Tullebasen on Greenland
Which, yeah, isn't exactly a base with a good reputation
I mean, my best friend lost her dad when she was 24, primarily because of what happened at Tulle
I'm pretty sure the Muricans need the base in Greenland more than we do
&#x200B;
So I always consider letting them stay there as payment covering what we should be paying in NATO, and if they want to leave NATO, they can leave that base
nothing
denmark is closely allied with america and works well with them on various military assignments
i dont really care if there would be placed a base in Denmark
but
im not sure if denmark is a good location for a military base
except maybe bornholm, our little island just south of sweden
De har jo en på Grønland
Almost all dairy products
In most of the world they don't have the climate for it, and where they do, they don't have quite the culture for it like in Europe
But but, the difference in the cheese also determines what you use it for
Swiss cheese in a ham and cheese toast, italian on pizza etc, know your cheese and use it in the best possible way
We have 1 'baltic' store
It has Lithuanian and Polish wares
It is unfortunately a bit out of the city and they are not re-stocked so often
I went there once and all they had left were jam and cookies :( And I really, really wanted some twaróg!
Not really
Although today I learned that kefir is Polish apparently
Spain
They have some much cultural influence, so many alliances, wars, colonial time etc
It has been Ukraine for a while
And I like to read about surrounding countries as well
I can't really put it in short
But my fascination includes; The megatrend of the Eurasian steppe meeting European agricultural cultures in Ukraine
Some of the processes of building national identities and nationstates that we in the West went through 100-150 years ago are taking place right now
The crazy complex ethnic mosaic over time
For instance in some ways the settlement of Southern Ukraine is really similar to the settlement of the American Midwest - attracting settles from all over (Swedes for instance
The riftzone between Catholicism and Orthodoxy and the religious mosaic in general
The bloody history of the "short twentieth century and the "bloodlands". (*Imagine you are born in 1900 and you are lucky enough to survive to you are 75
Then you would experience (weak word), first world war, civil war (were Ukraine was especially intense and complex), de-kulakization, hunger, Stalins repressions, second world war (including among many things holocaust by bullets, interethnic conflict and a multitude of partisan movements), hunger (again), the thaw under Khruschev and relative economic progress under Khruschev and Brezhnev
And this is just putting it simply*)
I find most countries' history interesting, but I definitely find European & East Asian the most interesting
Not OP, but several reasons
For one, your country's history overlaps with ours
Russia was founded by Vikings (from Sweden albeit, but still) and even the name derives from them
That's an intriguing connection with a country that is otherwise viewed as rather alien
That alien part also plays into it
Russia is European, even Northern European like us, yet sits at the border of Asia and has historically kind of done its own thing
Religiously, Orthodoxy has been outside the whole Protestant-Catholic schism, and is itself very interesting
There is, I'm sure, some degree of orientalist fascination - the meeting of the familiar and the odd
1800-1850s Copenhagen
There are some areas of the city i really want to see what looks like
Super basic but as someone born in 2003, I'd like to experience the super early internet
I figured a lot of it is just nostalgia jerking but it still sounds kind of interesting
I don’t even know the full version of my own national anthem, do you expect me to know others as well
A bit sad, but Idk
I know a couple of lines of the anthem of Sweden, Norway, Germany and Great Britain
All our neighbours
Would say almost everyone recognize and remembers the Russian one
I know the german really well Cause i’m part german but i also know the melody of the UK and irish pretty well
That is long, rip the Greeks
Among a lot of young people it's cool, but for adults we just see them as being dumb
Classics: Air pods and yeezys, the newest iPhone and apple watch
Answer: Ok flexer
Danish TV-shows are usually short, but I think the show with most episodes is Bamses Billedbog (Bamses Picturebook) it was a childrens show that ran from 1983 to 2008
If I take reality shows into consideration it would probably be Paradise Hotel which have 17 seasons with 40 or more episodes in each season
The dialect that people from near the German border, in Southern Jutland, speak, is nearly incomprehensible
Unfortunately, I ended up in said region for work
Fortunately, the dialect is one that the native speakers don't really pull out except among themselves
But I will occassionally overhear it and they may as well be Japanese for all that I can undertand of it
Sønderjysk (the area right north of germany) is almost a separate language
The people from South Denmark, sønderjyder, are impossible to understand
I'd say in many ways the dialects of Thybomål, Sønderjydsk and Alsisk, basically work as their own language - Bornholmsk at times as well
My grandmothers husband was from Als and my grandfather came from the Thy area, both of them were able to 'switch between the languages', so they would speak Thybomål and Alsisk with people who spoke the dialect, and 'Danish' with an accent, when people didn't.
The example I always give people to show how far the 'languages' are from each other is the word for the wheelbarrow
**Danish:** Trillebøren
**Alsisk:** Kritbaren
**Thybomål:** Æ tri'bør
That's it in part, but I think a bigger factor is that the traditional, ethnically Russian part of Russia is actually quite small
The vast majority of the country only became Russophone in the last few centuries, if at all, do dialects haven't really had time to diverge
My dad lives in the north, and his elderly neighbours speak Vendelbomål (similar to Thybomål), and it makes no sense to me
How does “deærjøwt
” mean the same as “det er super
” (“That’s great
Not to mention how it all sounds like one word, which makes it even harder to decipher lol
I love the different dialects, but they’re not always the easiest to understand
It is relevant if you want to discuss dialects
It is the reason why Denmark, which is a very small country, has (or at least had until recently) a vast number of very different dialects
The US, meanwhile, has much less dialectal diversity - insanely little, compared to the land-area
The reason is that DK has been inhabited by the same people for many thousands of years, so that the dialects on two islands may have had millennia to diverge
In Russia, meanwhile, much of the country used to speak different languages until recently
When they all shifted to Russian, that led to a much more homogeneous linguistic situation
Where I am on Fyn, like 4 or 5 times a year
It melts as soon as it hits the ground
Rarely, it's only five times a year-ish
It stays on the side of the road for a week though
A lot less than it used to
We used to get at least some snow every winter, but in the past decade, snow has been getting rarer and rarer
Like semi-accurate ... It's an exaggeration of course but it's a big deal when it snows here
If you call a relative in an area where it snowed that day it's the first thing they will tell you
The news will report if they think there will be snow on Christmas and that's also kind of a big deal
Oh that's interesting, where in Northern Greece, like city or region
I want to compare numbers with Fyn
Engineers being the
I'm pretty sure only the  Americans do that and we all have a version of "milliard".
We do the same in Denmark

Not necessarily true - I'm used to the 1

It used to be the other way, until someone, somewhere, made a mistake, and then it stuck
I don't think anyone really cares
Religion, or lack thereof, is seen as a private matter for the most part
It's a private matter
But expressing that you are religious is definitely weirder than expressing that you're an atheist
People don’t really care if you are an atheist or Christian so long as you behave
Overall people are neutral to atheists like me
Simply not believing in a god is very common, and in most circles you would most definitely be considered more weird for going to church every Sunday than for not believing in anything
I think the word "atheist" (ateist) can be a bit loaded, though, because many people think it means "antitheist". Because of that, whenever the topic of religious affiliations come up (for example when I have to tell people why I'm not confirmed), I often find it easier to just call myself a "nonbeliever" (ikke troende)

Not sure about the question
Does someone say pesh instead of pest
I'll pronounce it Budapesht when Hungarians pronounce Copenhagen "København".
> Does someone say pesh instead of pest
Like the entire population of Hungary says Budapesht
I think it's a monolingual thing
I haven't been there so have never heard it
Amazing question
German for sure
I love Germany, and it annoys me that I can't speak, and only barely understand, the language when I visit
So German would be an easy first pick
Second pick would be Faroese
Only spoken by like 50,000 people, but I plan to move there in a few years so I'm obviously gonna need to learn the language at some point
And they're part of the Realm of Denmark, so it kinda makes sense for Danes to learn the language at least a little bit
I guess I would go for Swedish for the third pick
I can understand Norwegian just fine, but Swedish rarely makes sense to me
Would probably be nice to be able to understand our neighbors
I’d go with Spanish, Arabic and Russian
Mainly because they probably have the most amount of countries speaking them, and I plan on someday riding around the world on a motorcycle
I didn’t pick Mandarin because, while there are more people speaking it, it is limited to few countries other than China
English Spanish and Chinese
That allows me to do business with ~80% of the world’s population
Imo there’s nothing interesting going on in Sweden that you won’t be able to read about in english on thelocal
Not that interesting, unfortuneately
I plan to move there and teach, because it’s just the perfect place for me to live
Nice and quiet with lots of nature
Big contrast to Denmark
Ah, well that’s a relief
I’m visiting the Faroes in December (if corona allows) and was worried I would seem rude if I just speak Danish
I plan to move there to teach in like three or four years, but haven’t really priortized learning the language yet, and it sounds like I don’t really need to, so that’s nice
Does angstschreeuw mean anxiety scream
Because  "Angstskrig" is the Danish word with most consonants in a row
> the convention to represent certain sounds with digraphs
imho still better than inserting even more diacritics in the language; you guys already have, I think, four different diacritics to add to letters
Now, that I think about it you *could* write 'szczekuszkowate' as 'ṡċekuṡkowate'...
I propose a splling reform
I’ll be teaching English and history
But yeah, I’ll definitely need to learn the language sometime
It's a bust
If you're in a classic Danish bar, don't ring the bar bell (it's really a ship bell) at the bar itself unless you're willing to pay a lot
If a guest rings the bell it means they want to buy a round for everyone in the bar/pub
Sometimes the staff will use it to signal "Last round
" as well though
Although it's an easy way to become popular if you ever ring it so I won't tell you to absolutely *never* do it
I've done it a few times but usually not when the places were at their busiest
It's a nice way to meet and talk to people if it's a place you're not too familiar with
Apparently, there's an important rule that I never knew until recently
If there's a bell in a pub and you ring it then the next round is on you
I had to leave because several people came over to me and demanded I pay
> If there is money on the side of the pool/snooker table, it means that someone has reserved the next game so you shouldn't 'jump the queue'.
We do the same, except we usually play a type of five-pin billard
People do that automatically in Sweden
We always need to go and kindly ask people, if they would be so nice as to take a table in the central room
It's the same thing in Köln, where they just patrol the halls with a rack of kölsch
They are fairly anal about the beer being fresh, so the glasses are also only 20 cl or so
Does the waiter keep track of your beers by noting the mat at you guys
Or do they note it in another way
What did you think the bell was for
Just frivolous noise-making
It takes longer to pour as it needs to settle
If you order it first, the barman can pour the Guineeses first, pour other drinks meanwhile and finish the Guinness
You had it on casks, which is the traditional vessel for beers, and if I remember correctly it was served as a mix between a freshly opened cask and one that was a few days older
If you ever have had a beer from cask you will know they are very light in carbonation, similar to what Guinness aims to mimick with the nitrogen
But since casks can be troublesome, given that they have to be managed properly, as once the cask is tapped, the beer inside changes radically in the course of a few days, while a keg can last for a month easily, more breweries have shifted to kegging their beer
And that's why Guinness wanted to do the whole nitro thing
Edit: thinking of it, I also think the whole "two pour"-system comes from back in the day, where it was mixed, as you'd pour 2/3s fresh and top it off with 1/3 aged beer
Drunk me says definitely
Well, many beers outside of heavy gravity stuff like doppelbock, barleywine and imperial stout usually gets stale about 3/4ths through
>  it's usually foreign brands who come up with these weird non-beer glasses
Or else it's just the best suited glass for the beer
Any beer that is just mildly aromatic benefits greatly from [a glass like this] or [this] from the two very non-foreign breweries, De Dolle Brouwers and the legendary Rodenbach
Well, that's more to do with old limitations and traditions
The Czechs manage to do a perfect hladinka in 10 seconds
All you need is a specific draught system
Guinness is served with nitrogen, which makes it pour differently
Edit: to follow up, here's an article about the Czech style side-pull faucets, with a quote about how quick they can pour three of the mythical 7 minute pours in just 11 seconds
[“It was fascinating to me that they could pour half-liters that fast,” he says
“It’s very different than the urban myth back here, you know, the ‘seven-minute pour
’ I taped a guy, and he filled three beers in 11 seconds
And the guy at Na Parkánu was doing something similar
That's the wheat beer pour
What Mediterranean beers have you seen in that sort of glasses
Most of them are pale lagers, which I can't remember ever seeing having a branded wine-glass/teku/snifter
I mostly have seen it for British, American and Belgian hop-forward beers and sour beers like vlaamse rood and some lambics
Yeah, I wrote a bit on this elsewhere in the thread, regarding what they did before nitrogen pours, that they used to mix beer from an old cask with beer from a fresh one
Interestingly I read a few hours ago that during the switch over period, they used to mix steel kegged nitrogen Guinness with a about a 1/3 from the old wooden cask, just to prove to people that there was no taste difference between the two
It's a great webpage in general, they have some neat articles
Yeah, as long as the beer settles, it's all good
Like you gotta ask yourself, would they ever sell the beer in cans, where it is practically only possible to serve it in one pour, if it "ruined the beer".
Great choice, my favourites have to be Tap7 and Weihenstephaner though, when it comes to hefeweizen

You only mention 6 verdensdeler - I think you forgot Asia
It's excellent
We have dedicated bike lanes almost everywhere
I ride my bike to school for about 7km and it's very rare that I'm not on a bike lane
In Copenhagen it has always been quite good, and the way the infrastructure is laid out hasn't changed much
[Here's an example from the 40s] and [the same place today]
The more recent and very welcome addition is a bunch of new bridges crossing the harbour
Cycling infrastructure in the countryside is more lacking, but generally fine in towns and cities
Excellent
It's my favorite mode of transportation
We miss a national plan though
The cycling infrastructure is good many places, but it's also lacking many places
Where we live, we have excellent separate bike lanes/paths some places, but (maybe) because of that, the municipality sort of thinks they don't need to do anything other places
I hope they build out the bike highways even more, so electric bikes can move more cars off the road
And Aarhus could use a widening of certain bike paths, like they have in Cph
While it is world class here for sure, our cities are still built around cars
I’ve cycled in the Netherlands and it is more pleasant and feels safer than in Cph
There, it really feels like streets were designed for cycling, and cars only allowed if there was enough space, and always on the cyclists’ premises
One thing I’ve noticed in Sweden was the lack of a curb/level difference between cycle path and pavement
Small detail but definitely think it makes people pay less respect to the bike path

Fairly confident that Kim Larsen will eventually become a major cultural figure
>Harald Fairhair
He's not historical, though
Don't forget the first to discover electromagnetism in 1819, **H.C. Ørsted**. After DONG Energy changed their company name to Ørsted, I think everyone knows the name
And honorable mentions:

**Svend Tveskæg** (Sweyn Forkbeard, son of Harald Bluetooth and father of Cnut the Great)

That plus weather explains the chav holiday no show, but Copenhagen could be a lager lout destination akin to Amsterdam - I guess how expensive everything is works as a very efficient deterrent

Our former PM Lars Løkke Rasmussen once dropped this golden nugget in a parliamentary debate:
"So we have chosen to create a system, where you have to hand over, a little less than what you did before
This is what we have chosen, and this of course leads to, that the people who earns more, and pays more, now pays a little less, well, they'll pay more less than the people, who earns a little less and pays less, but who is paying less less

Currently it could be seen better, but I believe it is changing, as more and more Romanians work and study in Denmark, and Romanians together with Poles are well set to become the biggest immigrant groups in Denmark
Also, it seems like people are slowly opening up the eyes to the country as a travel destination
I was recently(like 2 weeks ago) at a wedding in Western Romania, and ran into a huge group of Danish travellers outside the metropolitan cathedral in Timișoara
Romanians are not seen particularly positively as far as I can tell
>  If we can't talk in English, they either talk or understand Hungarian
Where did you go in Romania
I have yet to meet a non-Hungarian Romanian, who understands Hungarian
As a percentage of the population, Bulgaria actually has more Roma people ([10% in Bulgaria vs 3% in Romania]

But Bihor is also very close to the Hungary itself, and Oradea was almost 50-50 just a decade ago, I don't know if that can maybe have had some influence on how well people knew Hungarian, compared to Cluj

This is what I love about Transylvania, the only thing is that it could have been so much cooler, if all the Germans had remained, instead of being sold to West Germany

Depends a lot on your region
There are tons of shared customs and traditions between Northern Romania, Ukraine and Poland
Parts of it definitely is, but the country is more or less split three ways
I mean, if I'm not mistaken, Galicia/Asturias and the western British isles are part of the same ecoregion - the North-Atlantic Rainforest
What that essentially means is that the regions have similar climates (equally wet, misty, etc
) and, as a result, similar floras
Culturally, they are very distinct ofc
, but even then, there is a pretty long history of intermingling
Some ppl overstate the "Celticness" of Galicia (despite its name, it hasn't been Celtic for nearly 2k years, and even then, the Celts didn't originate there), but still, Galicia and Wales-Cornwall-Ireland are all essentially neighbouring regions from a nautical perspective
You could probably lump the Basques into that mix as well

Not sure since I don't have a lot of friends in that age group
As a 19 year old student with a part time job on the side I'll be saving around €6000 this year
So it very much depends on whether or not you live in Copenhagen (and surrounding areas) or another one of the big(ger) Danish cities
In Copenhagen
I'd say unless you have all the luck in the world (meaning somehow managed to get an apartment that's less than 1120+ EUROs per month all included, either through parents buying it or a stroke of luck) then you save next to nothing - and whatever you save you would probably spend on bigger expenses like dentist or technology
The average wage or a newly educated adult with a master's degree is around 30
000kr, meaning 2900 EUROs before tax
After tax you have around 19000kr left, which is 1800 EUROs
If you pay what most pay in rent, then around 1100 of these euro, go to just rent, water and gas, leaving you with 700 euros to pay for food, insurance, transport, union, A-kasse, etc
Let's be conservative (e.g. frugal) and say you can pay for all of that for 600 euros (that would be VERY CHEAP), leaving you with less than 100 euros to save and you still haven't spent a single dime on anything that isn't basic expenses - so no coffee or beer with friends, no trip to the cinema or expenses on Netflix, HBO, whatever
So I would say 50 EUROs, if you are frugal, could be saved for bigger expenses when those arise
Or, you could decided to live in another city than Copenhagen like Aarhus and pay half the rent you would in Copenhagen, or even Odense and Aalborg and pay even lower than half the rent
If you live any of those places you'd likely be able to save around 300 to 800 euros each month depending on the city
I live with my mom :)
I pay transport (€50 monthly), fitness membership (€25 monthly) and other smaller payments
Around €150 a month
Groceries a bit but I don’t pay anything towards mortgage or rent
No difference really
The difference is east vs  west

Technically it's illegal (in town and cities), but it's socially accepted (on nights  out partying) as long it's done privately

No pasta expert but I feel like the difference expresses itself more in the texture, shape of the pasta and the broader selection rather than the taste itself
Some double-blind tests should be fun
Yep, same deal with a Greenlandic person I spoke to
They had never felt cold in all their years living in Greenland, where it gets stupid cold but is at least dry, but often froze their ass off in Denmark where it's not as cold and humid
Danish has a similar weird spelling but we still don’t have it
We don’t have them in Denmark
We also don’t have as many Indian immigrants as USA lol
I don’t think it’s strange and fits well with American competitive mindset
It's also diktat in Danish

**Aarhus:** Copenhagen, but uncool
**Northern Jutland:** People who vote for the Socialdemocrats
**Bornholm:** Fishermen
**Faroe Islands:** Whalers who can't decide if they like us or not
**Greenland:** Drunk, depressed and cold
Jutland - Farmers
South Jutland - Farmers from Alabama

It's the other way around
You can't say Zealand doesn't have an accent, like with the double vowels and what not

Ppl will talk about how big the US, but for me, the somewhat shocking thing is more how *samy* it is
Obviously Americans will point out the regional differences, and they exist, but on a scale maybe 300x that of Europe
The regional differences between two US states as far apart as Norway and Italy are essentially equivalent to two neighbouring shires in the UK

The sink scraper is not common in Denmark
I was very annoyed when I found out not even IKEA sells it here
Seems like a huge waste of cabinet space
How do you open cans then
Yes, but it's convenient that all sizes of bread fits on it
Seems very inefficient to toast the buns that indirectly
Was just about to ask the same - we just use paper towels here
In my experience both are used here
In my family the Norwegian one is used in day-to-day life, and the string type for when guests come over (makes bigger and more uniform slices)
They exist here but they're not a very common variant
We dry them by hand, because why waste an entire cabinet on that
I don't see what's protective about the new kind
Why not just dry them off by hand and then you'll have a whole other cabinet to put stuff into
Also, Moldy dishes
We do use them regularly
I've only ever used one like what you linked to one or twice in my life
The one you usually find here is the [Raadvad model] They are indestructible and are found in every holiday home, our holiday home came with one already in the drawer
But seriously, no one uses them anymore, they are horrible to use, dangerous (one of my friends almost cut his thumb off with one, he is an idiot though) and everyone uses the type in the Wikipedia link
But for some reason it seems to be a topic of frequent complaint from German renters of danish holiday homes
You forgot "má ekki hylja" and "ei saa peittää"
It kinda is - although in my family we keep unused napkins from dinner parties for this purpose, as they may not be entirely clean and therefore can’t really be reused for the next party, but can be used for cleaning the sink
A lot of sinks here have a little grate on top of the drain so you’ll empty that out most of the time, but if you’ve been peeling  carrots or something I find people often use paper towels
Isn't that how all sockets are built
The sockets in my apartment are ancient (don't even have earth) but still have that
What
The logic is that since you don't use a cabinet for air drying dishes and instead dry them immediately you can use that cabinet for other stuff
Oh I thought you were too lazy to dry your dishes manually, and then moved the dishes from the drying cabinet to the dish cabinet once they had air dried
I was like duh
Of course you can keep the dishes in there (as in it could fit dishes) otherwise It'd be pointless
Legalise marijuana
Too much of the police's resources are spend on giving fines to people who smoke marijuana on daily basis
They are going to keep buying marijuana wether it is from the state or some illegal environment, so why not make it into something the state can gain from, instead of some local druglord somewhere
Edit: Or at least just fully decriminalise it
I haven't either, and it's not something I miss in my life
But I guess it is one of those luxuries that can be hard to live without, if you have gotten used to it
Much like aircondition in cars, a fast internet connection and so on
I remember doing fine without either, but now I certainly won't live without
So for that reason - I don't even want to try a bidet
Totally agree
I don't use it myself and don't really know anyone who does (to my knowledge anyway) - but I still want it to be legal for the reasons you mentioned
Free up time for the police to focus on solving crimes that have actual victims
Give the state a new source of income so other taxes can be lowered, or use it to improve hospitals or whatever
And take money away from the gangs
The amount of money being made on the illegal market is huge, and is one of the main things that attracts young people to become "gangsters".
A, once upon a time, close childhood friend of mine has been quite deep into the gang environment and other illegal activities
Last time I talked with him, a little over a year ago, he told me he rather wants marijuana to be illegal because otherwise he would earn less money
Wow I thought you were better than that
I like the idea - but 99% of my fellow Danes would probably wonder why anybody would want to carry cash
ATM's and banks with actual money are getting closed down everywhere here
Well I’d like to know why
I don't go to Copenhagen often, but when I do, I almost always see a couple of Swedes trying to drink themselves to death
I totally support your wish to be able to buy alcohol at all times from normals stores :-)
Many
I live in a small town with a cathedral from the 12th century and a lot of smaller buildings with housing from the same time period
It is honestly a pain in the ass if you try renovate or do anything if you live in that sort of building, but there is usually no problem with amenities such as running water, toilets or anything else you have in a modern home
>Driving on cobblestone paved streets sucks
Doubly so for cycling, I'll take a detour to avoid even small cobblestone sections
Luckily there aren't that many anymore
Wouldn't building a metro in Malta be a waste of money
Like sure, it would cut travel time quite a bit, but wouldn't it take maaaany years, before it would make more money, than it cost to build, since the country is so small
In general, old buildings actually have better insulation than newer ones, due to the thicker walls and smaller windows
They'll have worse heating, though
Ofc
if the building isn't in great shape, with holes in the roof and crevaces under windows, then that'll take its toll on the insulation
Haha, my little town in north jutland has cobblestones all over
I'd consider a house from 1900 semi-old, yeah, but not notably so
It also depends - if it's a free-standing house, 1900 is quite old
If it's a big apartment-block or a house-row, they can easily be a lot older
Suburbs in general are a younger phenomenon
Danish multi-party coalition system, currently 9 parties in parliament, lots of choice
Youth binge drinking is clearly here to stay forever, but casual beer drinking among adults is much different than even in the 90s, there's less of it publicly, it's gone from the workplace, and the middle and upper classes have largely moved to wine
Also back in the day there were like 5 different beer options and most drank either Tuborg ("grøn"), Carlsberg ("hof") or Faxe draught beer (if at an event or a football match) - that changed a lot with the craft beer explosion the past few decades, people want to geek out a little over what they consume instead of conforming to the cultural norm
I see a lot of danish traditions being switched out with american ones and it actually makes me kinda sad because I know it’s also a thing in other countries as well
Even our language is adopting english words instead of making up our own new ones
Our dictionary is only like 2000 words long or smthn so i’m afraid the language will die out some day
We do something similar at "fastelavn", unfortunately the snaps never caught on here
> it's gone from the workplace
Good
I've heard a number of stories from my colleagues about how back in the day they knew some guys(not the same ones) who would be useless after midday because they'd be so drunk
Also how it wasn't unusual to have a number of beers for lunch
Sounds scary to me, I'm happy we've moved beyond that
Yoo I totally mistyped
We have 200
000 words and Swedes have 600
000 so you still got us beat
But the average dane only knows around 25
000 words because we barely understand our own language as you swedes probs already know lmao so our situation is still not great
And I agree abt the part with americanisation
I totally reject the traditions and honestly they are so capitalistic that it kinda feels like brain wash sometimes
That’s because they are
We just stress on different letters depending on what we wanna say
How Do People Drive on Small / Narrow Roads
Just curious how people tend to drive on the small or narrower roads where you live
I moved out into the countryside and we live on a narrow road where two normal size cars can pass at the same time
If a large truck comes you have to pull really far over into the grass / dirt
It's usually okay, but sometimes it gets a bit close
Some people will fly trough the small roads at 60 km/h (legal limit btw) especially in areas with blind corners or hills
To me it's completely stupid to do this because you have no idea what's coming .  I drive maybe 30km/h or 40km/h so I have the time to  pull over to the side just in case
Similar problem in cities of course, but usually the speeds are lower
Edit: [Example] of how such roads look
That's pretty cool to hear
Woah
Those roads seem really narrow
I think most people here would think they are bikes only or something
Sorry
REVERSING on a  HIGHWAY
What
What sadness
Wagner was certainly a deeply flawed figure, even by the standards of his time, but to simply dismiss his work as emblematic for this reason is, I think, misguided
Germany has more reason than most to wish to distance itself from the past, but learning from its mistakes is not the same thing as torching those who made them
We have a place called 'Himmelbjerget' translatet 'Skymountain', it might be the higest point in Denmark but its only 150 meters over sea level
> Varkaus= theft
Varkaus was apparently also an old word for "strait", and the city is located on straits in a lake, so it actually does make sense
> The Irish word for Wales translates to Little Britain
I’m sorry
Welsh is the most widely spoken descendant of Brythonic, and the word "Britain" is a Latinised version of a P-celtic name for the Island
You could say, that Wales is the last remnant of pre-Saxon Britain
So "Little Britain" is in fact a pretty appropriate name
There's nothing wrong with that, as Welsh is a modern descendant of Brythonic
Along with Brittany it is the last remnants of pre-saxon Britain
Calling it little Britain seems very apt
Britain, Brittany, Brythonic, Brittania, it's like they are all variations of the same word, huh
But it’s not the highest point in Denmark proper
Himmelbjerget is only 140m, the highest point is Møllehøj at 180m.
No, you have to park at the bottom and buy mountain-climbing equipment from the local store
In Denmark, the big fear is for the Danes to lose influence in the political sense
We are a very small country, with a very small population
We do not want France, Germany or Spain to have more influence in our politics
The Danes are very self-important, and believe Denmark is the greatest place to live
The EU is already too political in my opinion, and should become a trade union
Edit: I was wrong about something, I have corrected my comment
That was embarrasing, lol
You are correct, and I was misinformed
At home 8 hours of sleep have always been a minimum, and we would eat dinner and usually breakfast together everyday
After I moved out, started gymnasium and got a job my time has become far more valuable
I sleep less, have less ridget meal times
I think stress and lacking sleep is very common here, although it depends a lot on where you live, what you work as and your general lifestyle
Do I have time for sleep and a proper meal
It's two of the most important aspects of life
If one day I can't find the time over a longer period ind my life, I should relly consider changing my lifestyle
Of course life can be busy from time to time, but rarely so I miss sleep and food
Denmark: When at home on my own as a student - frozen meals and coffee from the bakery down the street
But I often go visit mom and dad
And here it is sitting around the table and having a big meal everynight
Sleep - I get my sleep
I have a bed time
30 - because I need to wake up at 6
All my friends know this
So if we are playing videogames, I leave and go to bed
That's it
So I always get my sleep
According to my parents all the traditions surrounding our [graduation hats] are quite new
So, when we graduate academic secondary education when we're around 19, we drive around in an open truck all day with our classmates, while stopping at each kid's parents' house to get snacks and drinks
Plus a month of reading vacation where you’re supposed to study for exams but you just party
This is not new, it's so old that it used to be a horse carriage instead of a truck
What *is* relatively new (emerged during the 90's perhaps
) are the traditions surrounding the hat:
* Sex with the hat on - cut a triangle in the cap
* Finish 30 beers all by yourself in 24 hours - cut a square in the sweatband
* Kiss someone of your own sex - turn the cross around
* Have sex with someone of your own sex - remove the cross entirely
* Have sex with a boyfriend/girlfriend with the hat on - a heart in the sweatband
* Getting hospitalized because of too much alcohol - cut the entire shade off and look like an idiot
I could  go on
There is also the "puttefest" - "hazing" rituals for entering high school
A putte means a darling, sweetie etc, and is used for first year academic high school students
In the Copenhagen area, the public puttefest is drinking our brains out in a forest while writing weird stuff on each other
There are also some schools where they turned quite nasty and there were rumours of sexual assault on the first year girls
But according to my friend from Lolland, there, they throw all the first year students in a lake
We have J-day (short for Christmas Day) and P-day (short for Easter Day)
This is when one of the largest breweries in Denmark releases their Christmas/Easter special beer and nearly everyone goes to bars and clubs
That sounds so nice
Nordsjælland here
My gymnasium has a tradition of throwing first yearers down a huge hill
It's very violent but fun
I think in Denmark students used to wear them longer than they do now
At least I have seen lots of pictures from the 50's of university-students wearing their graduation-hats
I know, I’ve watched SKAM
It looked fun but hella expensive
Also the it looked like there could be much drama surrounding it when everybody does it with their own friend group
Like, what if you’re lonely
Sydjylland here
Our Gymnasium has a tradition of making first yearers run UP a hill, while second and third yearers stand on the sides and throw flour, ketchup, milk, water balloons, etc
at them
Østjylland here
My gymnasium called the first years "smølfer" and played [this song] on repeat for the entire first introduction week of school, over the hall and class speakers
We also had separate cantinas and any smølf caught sneaking into the second or third year cantina, was painted blue and forced to wear a smurf costume
in the 1800s it was common to simply wear them all the time, to indicate you were a student - that happened both at university and 'high school'. In the original Nøddebo Præstegård script from 1862, for example, its mentioned that Nikolaj and his brothers all wear them
They were black back then, though ([1970s version of the movie includes the hats] They [became white around the 1920s] and then after WW2 I believe it became common to only wear them at graduation - perhaps because it was harder to get them made/afford them during the occupation
Damn, why don't we have that
Our school threatened us to stop our tradition of violence against the first yearers, it sucks ass
Midtjylland here - at my school on the first day of school, the third year students dress up like on fastelavn an throws glitter at the first years
Also they're called "sutter" (pacifiers or suckers) and they are all handed an inconvienient amount of necklaces with [this candy] on it
Yeah it's very big
But what if it is seperated top/bottom instead of right/left
As far as I recall, the practice stopped during ww2, but I can't say for sure if it wasn't picked up after again
But I know my granddad only wore his on his gradutation day, and he graduated around 1945-ish, maybe a year or two later, can't recall
I also know it was a trend in the 60s and 70s to not have a studenterhue at all, especially amongst hippies and progressives, so likely it wasn't something you wore back them other than on graduation day
My aunt has mentioned more than once she never wore one and almost nobody in her year did (she often teases my dad for having one) and she graduated late 60s/early 70s
Don’t really think we have any cities that feel foreign tbh
Of course if you’re not from Copenhagen, you might think it’s a bit different from the rest of the country given its sheer size
Personally if I were to point out any “cities” I’d mention the ones in southern Denmark close to the German border due to their much different dialect
But it’d be more appropriate to refer to them as towns
Born and raised in Copenhagen
Copenhagen feels the most foreign particularly in the summer during tourist season where even a native dane will be mistaken for a foreigner in the shops
Such an entirely different vibe from other big cities like Aalborg or Aarhus which feels more danish and homey
Not the city but part of it; Nørrebro in Copenhagen
It will probably divide the waters; But first of all, there are a lot of immigrant shops
Secondly, many student live there, so obviously it has a different atmosphere than the rest of the city
Thirdly, it is generally just a very rough and crime-infested place
Most normal
Roskilde
Full of people in Fjällraven or beige parkas with knit-hoodies, old Danish buildings, the typical city-cathedral and then just a bunch of 70-90's villas all of them about the same size, no huge outliers
The capital, Copenhagen, is so different to any other place in the country
Yeah compared to what I’ve seen from years of being on this sub, I feel like we actually don’t have that much regional and dialectal variety compared to most countries
We really exaggerate it among ourselves
If you count districts in cities, it’s most certainly [Freetown Christiania] though
Basically a hippie commune with loads of weed, concerts and farm animals dumped in the middle of Copenhagen
Not VERY foreign, but I do get a slightly "Northatlantic" feeling in Thyborøn or Hanstholm
I mean, if typical Danish cities is one of the cosy small towns on the east coast of Jutland or in the Islands, the mentioned towns will certainly stand out
Regarding the dialectal differences I’ll have to agree to some extent
Nowadays it’s slightly difficult to pinpoint where somebody is from based on the dialect given that it’s considered to be uncool to speak in dialect (at least in the younger generation)
However, I can face some trouble understanding elderly people from other parts of the country
You’re right
In a sense
Although it’s a part of the kingdom, it’s still very much a country on its own
Just like the Faroe Islands
> 20CHF
Christ, that's expensive even by *our* standards
I mean there's the fact that Berlin isn't inhabited by Germans in large part
Though true, that's also the case for cities like Hamburg or Köln
There, I'll take the blame for saying the 'mean' thing instead of the Germans
And even putting that aside, the culture with these young german leftie types in Berlin, you can't seriously deny that this is much further from traditional German culture than as you'd see it in Bayern, or even much of Eastern germany, or even just any small-medium sized town anywhere in western Germany
Maybe you don't care about that, but either way it objectively clearly is distant from it
And that's why it doesn't feel German
Danish is a very "clean" looking language similar to English, but unlike English we have the amazing letters of Æ, Ø and Å. That alone makes written Danish the obvious choice
[The trouble is that we don't say what we write]
It should be the next lingua franca just to force Swedes to speak it
that would be gold
Rødgrød med fløde
Say it say it
It shouldn’t be the next lingua franca because it is a completely irrelevant language outside of the country and Greenland
And nobody likes the way we say 97
Why danish *shouldn’t* be chosen
The grammar is simple, except for when it comes to determine wether to choose “en” or “et” as the indefinite article and “den” or “det” as the definite article
There is no rule to know this and it’s practically impossible for foreigners to know what article to choose
The only way to know what article to choose is to grow up with the language and slowly learn the right article as you learn the language
Danish would not work because people say it’s like talking with a potato in your mouth
I know it's a difficult topic and most of you write in bokmål, but - from where I stand - nynorsk just comes off so much more like what Norwegian should be, if that makes sense - bokmål is too much like Danish
I dread to imagine foreigners having to stumble through Danish pronunciations during EU Parliament debates
Kan folk ikke lide vores 97
i agree, spanish is a beautiful language
I know it’s just a joke but in what world is French a rational language
Sweden and Denmark have fought each other for centuries and hold the record for most wars fought between them
It all adds up to around 30 wars since the 15th century
They are our annoying big brother
The Å is half of the word "Nå". Learn that, and you can have entire conversations in Danish
Angel is engel :-)
[Pronunciation]
En, to, tre, fire, fem, seks, syv, otte, ni, ti
don't worry, we don't switch to 20-base before 50, lol
It has the exact same difficulty as counting in German
It's not difficult to pronounce 50-90:
Halvtreds, tres, halvfjerds, firs, halvfems
Just don't think too much about that they are 20-based
Well, we're the only Scandinavians that can spell properly, but perhaps we should pronounce written Danish in Norwegian, lol
Lol yeah guess so
syv og halvfems (seven-and-half-fives) :)
But we do start with the least significant number from 20 up to 99
Funny thing is, 40 is also called fyrretyve, even though it doesn't come from base 20
Fyrretyve actually means '4 tens". In old nordic it was  'fjórir tigir', and that developed into fyrretyve through history
Just to add a bit of extra confusion into the base 20 system everybody knows and loves :-)
And other languages can’t?
If it was Swedish, hell yeah
We would understand most of it, but not speak it ourselves
>Funny thing is, 40 is also called fyrretyve
It's funny because it looks like "four twenty" :-)
Exactly, but that is only done to fool the Germans
Since Sweden doesn't have æ or ø, why would you care where Denmark and Norway have their letters
Danish keyboards simply follow the alphabet (Æ Ø Å), so there's little reason to the change the order
It's strange that they don't use a Danish/Scandinavian keyboard in Norway, when they have the same order of Æ Ø Å in the alphabet
It's only Sweden that has a different alphabet
Yes, like I said, it makes no sense, that Norwegians don't use the Danish/Scandinavian version
*"Let's decide that Schlesweig and Holstein are Danish instead of German"* said Denmark
*"How about I kick your fucking teeth in"* said Prussia
*"I'd like to see you try"* laughed Denmark
And then Prussia kicked Denmarks teeth in
Thinking a tiny backwards country could defeat Prussia AND Austria in a war in 1864
Everything really went downhill after supporting Napoleon
Attacking Prussia in 1864
Immigration policies
I just had my lifes best orgasm
Denmark, I realy should get one of those flags
Even I agree
Then it's bad
0K to -10c : "Holy fuck it's winter
-10c to -5c : "Yay it's winter
-5c to 5c : "Motherfucking shit winter fucking winter weather
5c to 15c : "meh, as long as it's not raining it's OK
15c to 18c : "This weather is *perfect* for sleeping with the windows open
18c to 23c : "T-shirt and jeans, yay
23c to 27c : "T-shirt and shorts, yay
27c to 30c : "Why can't I spend the whole day in the kiddie pool
:("
30c+ : "Please kill me
i'd say, for me, here in Denmark
<0 = cold
0-10 = chilly
10-17 = acceptable
18-25 = ideal for me
26-30 = warm but nice
30+ = too hot
a lot of people i know, feel very different from me
especially woman, tend to be colder than me
I will take a sweater and shorts any day over T-shirt and Jeans
You're one of *those* people
I done messed that up
oopsie
You mean the sane kind
We get really depressed
A lot of people light a lot of candles
That seems to bring some warm comfort, or "hygge".
It is kind of depressing
It's only bright from 8:30-15:30 right now, and even then it's still somewhat dark
I'm at about 57 degrees north
I usually don't get winter depression, but for my girlfriend it's usually pretty rough
We bought an alarm clock that has a light that looks like the sunrise, so thqt helps a bit
Other than that, we get up early to see the sun rising and go to bed early as well
It gets dark at around 15:00 anyways
I live at 55° now which isn't as bad as the 70° back in Greenland
Adjusting to constant darkness back then could be difficult, but at least you could sleep unlike when it's daylight 24/7 in the summer
I don't know why, but I actually prefer it this way
I lived near the equator for a while and found the constant 6am to 6pm daylight slightly disturbing
Probably just too used to this
We get on with it
No, but really
It affects people very differently
I never thought much about it, because I was busy
Went to work/school and then had a lot to do in my free time
And in december the darkness is countered by warm lights and social coziness (hygge)
The first time it really started to affect me is this year, living on my own and being unemployed it all seems a lot more gloomy and limiting
We don't deal with it, more like suffer through it
The difference between a cloudy day and a sunny day for me is like going on and off antidepressant
It sucks big time, especially when there is no snow
Winter depression is s real thing that many people struggle with
..and it's been raining for a month, so chances of actual sunlight are practically nil
I've found that lots of Christmas lights help
We've hung strings of lights from the gutters, on the garage, on the flagpole, and on top of the hedges surrounding the house
Plus a few "light nets" tossed over various trees and bushes in the garden
It's nice to be able to look out of the windows rather than just see a dark reflection of yourself
Inside it's either lots of candles and getting the fire going in the fireplace, for warmth and that cozy orange light, or it's high-lumen white light to fool our reptile brains into thinking it's actually daytime
Apart from that it's all about getting outside as much as possible when it's daytime - especially if you're lucky enough to have a relatively cloudless day
We probably won't get any snow this winter (thank you global warming
) but when that happens everything gets a bit lighter from all the white snow
Finally you add a good amount of alcohol to this, and everything is either bearable, or you either flee south for a winter vacation, kill yourself due to a winter depression, or build a longboat and go looking for somewhere warmer and lighter to invade
Same
Sun rises around 9:00 and goes down around 15:30 ish
Iceland is in the "wrong" timezone
They should by geography be -1 instead they are in 0 along with UK
Basically sunrise should be 10:10 and sunset 14:32
Why the pre-viking Danes bothered to annex Jutland is a question half of the country is still asking
No, to be serious, there is actually a lot of lacking knowledge of this period, mainly whether we originated on Zealand or Scania, but regardless, we ekicked out the Herulians, who for some reason became kings in Lombardy
Don't ask me
Pre-medieval Germanic history is weird
Edit: I may be spreading fake news about the Herulians
They either came from Lombardy to Denmark or vice versa
"original Europeans" is kind of a hazy and problematic term though
Don't listen to this sneaky panda, min elskede Norge
Don't worry, I understand, but as far as I know, we can't track back to any single original people either
Indo-european people were just some of the people that migrated to Europe
Plenty came before, plenty came later
That was just what I wanted to highlight for people reading
>	Morals are not, and I mean not, in any way, arbitrary
Of course they are
For instance, Americans think eating horse meat it despicable and immoral, and have for all intents and purposes outlawed it
In other cultures - similar cultures even - it is eaten without raising an eyebrow
It's really difficult piecing that stuff together
A mixture of linguistics and archaeology can get you a long way, but in the end, a lot of it is just guess work
I will check out that theory though, see what it's about
[Brønshøj Boldklub]
No bias there, they were popular when I used to play FIFA, you would often see people using those
It’s Werner the Wasp (Hvepsen Verner)
Something like the beat to this song, named after the city I live in (Copenhagen, Denmark):
The first three minutes of this song would be the theme at midnight on a Thursday:
Danish Hygge
Trust in your fellow man
> Maybe hygge too, but the Dutch have their gezelligheid and the Germans are gemütlich, so it's not really unique
Nobody really claims it unique, it's just English-speaking media, that discovered they didn't have a direct equivalent word in English
We already have that
I find that peoples view of janteloven depends a lot on the way it's framed when they get introduced to it
What do you call entitled children/helicopter parents in your language
In Danish, we call them "Curlingbørn" and "Curlingforældre" (curling children and curling parents), because, like in curling, the parents sweep the way for their precious children in life
Do other languages have similar semi-slang terms for this
EDIT: Typo
That's funny, we also have that one in Danish: *Hønemor
>someone spelled mother as moder, father as fader and bubble as buble
Are you trying to mock my nation
Do you live near a tourist site, but you have never personally been
This always amazes me
It's right there, close to where you live
But you simply never go there
Never been
For me there is a large military musuem with tanks and artillery in my town, that I've never been to
And it's about to close actually, so don't think I'll ever get the chance now
Then there is a history museum in the next town, that people love, with like one floor being a recreation of how the city looked back in the old days, and you can explore it indoors - I've never been there either
But strangely used the library attatched to the museum many times
How about you
Yeah, i live in Copenhagen and i've never been inside Thorvaldsens museum, Amalienborg or the townhall just to mention a few
The thinking is something along the lines of "well i live here, i have plenty of time to see it some other day
". That day just never seem to come around
I live like 100 meters from the birthplace and childhome of Denmarks most famous writer, Hans Christian Andersen, and i have never stepped foot inside
I remember reading about them making it so you can only walk by it to protect it
And it makes sense, but yes I thought about going there when I went to London a few years back, but decided since you can't really get close to it anyway, you get more out of watching a documentary about it
That looks beautiful though
Thanks for sharing
I've been to the London Eye
It was rainy
We couldn't see far
And the pictures were aweful
Thorvaldsen though, is soo cool
The sculptures are breathtaking
I've been there a few times now, and exicted to go again
When I went to Istanbul oh holiday our hotel was just by the blue mosque
We went to the Asian side for like 3 hours, where we went to a shopping center, and bought some cloths
And that was it
Then we went back to the European side
So you have never been to like Galata Tower, or Hagia Sofia
Ah I love Lego though, I'd totally go
But yes, would be more fitting if it was here in Denmark
I used to hate being outdoors in general
Hated it
Then I began making walking part of my daily rutines, so instead of taking the bus, I'd leave earlier and walk for excersise
Suddenly I got hit by this walking bug
I started wearing hiking boots everyday for I never knew where my feet would take me
I explored ever street of my home town, every corner, every path
Found some hidden gems and such
If the weather is good, I'll just head out, and then call my parents to get me when I've walked towards 20kms in just a random direction
Well
That was then
I've gotten a mysterious foot injury, got it last summer
I go to specialist to specialist, and no one has any ideas what is wrong
I am right now sitting in my bed, doped on painkillers, hardly able to walk, the weather being so nice outside, and just miserable honestly
When I am done with online school in about 2 hours I'll grab my bike and go for a ride
But I don't get the same enjoyment as when I walk
Walking and hiking is special
I wish one day to be able to do it again
So walk
Explore
Those are great things to do
I lived in Orange country just outside of Los Angeles for 2 years, first thing we did, was getting year card for Disneyland
Awwwhh yisss
Was basically the best part of my years there
Going to Disneyland everyweek, upto multiple times
But since then prices has gone up, and I am not sure if we'd gone there now, we'd been able to do that
Allegedly the birthplace apparently
I went there years ago, and it was just a small house with some old furniture at that point
You're not missing much
Have you been to the HC
Andersen Museum then
I think i have been to the museum, but its years ago, when i was like 8-9
Varde Artillery museum maybe
Apparently it's moving to Oksbøl. I doubt tøjhusmuseet is going anywhere
Right next to Tivoli is Carlsberg Glyptoteket
One of my favorite places in the world
It's free one day a week, btw, and you just go in there and walk between statues and layers of history
I live almost as far from Copenhagen as I can get
But if they have a special exibition, I head there as soon as I can
Now Thorvaldsen is not far from Tivoli, but it is next to Christansborg
Litterally on the side of the goverment building
Yes Varde Artillery museum is the place
I live in Varde
Here in Denmark we count cases of beer
1 kasse øl. 2 kasser øl. 3 kasser øl. etc
1 kasse øl, to kasser øl, tre kasser øl ... and so on
It means "1 crate of beer, 2 crates of beer, three crates of beer"
Yes, this
And alternatively, but not less stereotypically, we count potatoes
1 kartoffel, 2 kartofler, 3 kartofler etc
The great thing about the word øl is that it already sounds lke drunk mumbling, so no matter how drunk you are, you are always able to ask for one more
Really
I've never heard of this one
The norwegian was is more like "thousand and one, thousand and two etc
No, no, you have to drink them
For us Danes, it really only takes one second to drink a whole case of beer
Using our flag everywhere, especially on birthdays
When I was a young child I lived in the US for a few years, and it took me a while, and only after starting in elementary school to realize that our flag wasn't "the international birthday flag" which I had thought for a while
Christmas calendar tv-shows
24 episodes a new one released every day of December leading up the Christmas eve
Well, sticking with the food theme, I think salatpizza, which is a pizza with döner kebab, iceberg, tomatoes, cucumber slices and creme fraiche dressing, is unique to Denmark, or at least  Scandinavia
I have certainly never seen them anywhere else
Otherwise, proper dark rye bread is all but impossible to find outside of Denmark
We put thin pieces of chocolate on top of our bread
>I mentioned it to them, and they seemed confused
Your Danish friend must be from Jutland
There are many fish and chip places in Copenhagen
> Ok so turns out that after talking to a Danish and German friend, fish and chip shops are not found outside of the UK
There's at least 5 in Copenhagen
The Danish flag isn't widely used Imo, usually only on birthdays & when someone dies
> and the fact that we heat up olive oil and onion in the pot before cooking rice by default
This should however be the default everywhere
sounds awesome
And there are usually several of them
Both DR ("our BBC") and TV2 tend to have one for children, and then there'll be some for older people/adults as well
Yes
In Sweden they put sugar in ryebread
And in northern germany they bake the s**t out of it
So its almost a cracker
I think NHS is pretty 1:1 with the system we have here - even down to the fact that it doesn't cover dental
Also a thing, here
We call it saftevand
Everybody knows what Ribena is
Our homegrown brand is Rynkeby, who also do a blackcurrant squash, but the most popular flavour is mixed fruits
Several other brands do cheap, chemically, sugarfree, super-concentrated squash that you mix 1:11 or something in flavours like cola, orange/raspberry, "sport", and elderflower
I'm from Sjælland and have never seen one in my life
Live in Copenhagen, but am from Jylland - I've literally never seen a fish'n'chip shop in Denmark
Plenty of restaurants sell it as part of their menu, though
There's plenty in Jylland, just gotta go to harbours to find them obviously
Is it like fastelavn
We do in Denmark every February, and I know it''s common in Austria as well
us too - as far as I know, its a left-over from being occupied during WW2
It was like a resistance kind of thing, according to my grandfather
Yes, it's used all the fucking time
I'm not sure where you're from exactly but if you're from a city then obviously fewer people will have flag poles there than in suburbs, smaller towns etc
I can take a step outside my front door and see several flags every single day here
Plenty of stores also have flags outside regardless of there being a sale or not, even those small wall mounted ones on each side of the door/window or just one of those ~2 meter wooden flag poles that you can just place wherever you want
You see the same with those little "honor system" cart thingies as well, they're usually have at least one flag on them
Plenty of companies also have the Danish flag as part of their logos
It's also used for absolutely every type of celebration
Birthday, wedding, confirmation, graduation, national holidays, town fairs etc
etc
You'll obviously see way more flags if you live in a place where the average person has a flag pole though, which isn't really the case if you live in an apartment in the middle of one of the larger towns or cities
No, I think I might have it at most once a week
And even that  pretty much just in winter
We have bad ones, but we also have great ones
Some are considered classics, and are reaired every few years
And you've got adult ones too, with a certain satire one in particular having achieved cult status
EDIT: Honestly, at least if you're already familiar with Christmas calendars as a concept, you should give the infamous *The Julekalender* a watch this Christmas - that's the cult one I mentioned
It's a riot
The Julekalender
You bake the pizza without the veggies and dressing, and add them after
Yeah - I grew up on Fyn, and been living in Copenhagen for almost a decade now
Never seen a fish & chips joint, I think
Maaaaybe at a fun fair once or twice
I did say Copenhagen
Slagelse has the best kebab though
>I've literally never seen a fish'n'chip shop in Denmark
[Chuck Bass Fish & Chips]
[Crazy Chips]
[Fish and Chips - Tivoli]
A country that puts caraway seeds in their bread has nothing to offer to this conversation ;)
Which is the company's birthday
Such a cult hit it was remade in several countries even - though I might be biased, I still say the OG danish one with De Nattergale was the best
I watch it every Christmas
German ryebread, while not over-baked, isn't as moist as Danish (also, yours taste like chocolate for some reason
I currently have a German exchange student living with me, and she had to toast our ryebread extra, because she doesn't like how mushy it is (she also didn't like how sour it is, so now she just gets German ryebread shipped to her, from her parents)
Just needed a little bit of honhonhon in there too, and - voila
Huh, I had no idea
I appreciate the trivia
Do you know which countries had those remakes, and what they're called there
I'd be pretty interested in checking them out
Norway and Finland for sure
Perhaps Sweden as well, I cant recall :)
Cheers
Denmark's treatment of Greenland hasn't exactly matched the descriptions of the small 'hyggelig' country I see other places
We did slave trade long ago
Danish West indies
Now renamed to United States Virgin Islands
and sold the islands to USA afterwards
iirc the slaves did a lot of building of houses and such in Copenhagen
i've not really read details on it
Some time after the europeans colonized, the Inuit moved in as well
We then proceeded to treat them like second or third class citizens until circa 1980
No, we're pretty fond of each other and have a good relationship
They're part of the realm community because they choose to
I haven't heard about any outright animosity towards us, at least
Actually you guys might be innocent
You think you get off easy, but most Danes don’t even know how bad Denmark was
We took more slaves than France, you guys, Spain or Portugal (can’t remember which), and the US
3rd most slaves of all Europeans, but they’re remembered for Lego
I've never heard anyone refer to a faroese person as a Dane
It's true, we consider it part of Denmark, but in the same way we consider Greenland a part of Denmark
They're in the kingdom of Denmark, but not a part of the country of Denmark
And as far as know, there has been nothing about anyone wanting out as of recently, but maybe I just haven't heard of it
Oh, I see
Still, I don't really think most Danes see the the Faroe Islands as part of Denmark the country
There might be a couple of people who don't really know how it works, but I'd say only few Danes aren't able to distinguish between Denmark the country and Denmark the Kingdom :)
We have Greenland and the Faroe Islands as well as municipalities
They are all self-governing, but the difference is that the municipalities are constitutionally self-governing, which Greenland and the Faroe Islands are not
On the other hand, Greenland and the Faroe Islands have so wide autonomy, that they basically function as small countries in local matters and are even included at some level in state affairs
The municipalities' autonomy is limited to standard municipality functions
They are still very popular in Denmark
And you can get them in any good hardware or kitchenware store
Yes
I have those
I buy every tool from Fiskar, if available
Always durable and high quality
Yup, I have three of them
Two of [these]
And then some smaller black model that I can't find on their website, I think it's meant for cutting hair
I have had them for like 20 years now and they're still working great
I also have various gardening tools made by Fiskars, great products imo
Don't know why, but those scissors reminds me of 'børnehave'(kindergarten)
The same ones
I thought they were just taking turns
It would probably cause the British to come by and bomb copenhagen again
Well there would Probably be some angry British demanding us to hand over our navy
Finally get to check in the fact we stayed with'em till the end
Pls gib Norway
I go back inside, since I only just arrived and only had four beers
Then I come back out at 3 at the earliest and go get a Döner or a pizza-slice
I go back inside, because the night is barely halfway done
The bar won't close and the beers won't stop coming for at least a few more hours
If I'm still hungry after then, I'll probably be grabbing a mix shawarma and chicken pita bread at one of the many shawarma joints that stay open all night in Copenhagen
45 is sooooo early
When you get out of class at 11:15 and start drinking right after, then it's not that early
Not one, but a row of buildings in [Nyhavn]
Perhaps the castle of Hamlet, [Kronborg] but I think it's more the story than the castle itself
Denmark
Kronborg Slot (UNESCO heritage site also featured in Hamlet)
Isn't it also like the only island in Slovenia
Not a building, but when you mentioned the Statue of Liberty, I immediately thought of this huge beast:
I haven't seen it myself, but I think it is pretty famous here in Denmark as well because of the designer
Maybe storbæltsbroen, Rosenborg or Christiansborg
From an outsider perspective, I would say the Opera House in Oslo
The Oslo Opera House is cool, but what my mind goes to when thinking about some Norwegian architecture is this:
>row of buildings with the little mermaid infront
[Like this
> that tunnel/bridge between denmark and sweden
Øresund Bridge, but we like to say it's to Scania and not Sweden
It's not a building though
Just imagine how good friends we could be if that happened
and expensive
You say that now, but we won't ever forget that time you walked over the ice
Just a head's up, biking isn't \*that\* common for everyday commuting throughout all of Europe
It's quite specific to a few countries, most notably the Netherlands and Denmark (and a few others in some specific cities)
In Denmark, bikes are incredibly varied
Some people have a lighter bike, some have a heavier one
Some prioritize baskets (mostly on women's bikes), some have a [Christiania bike] in addition to their normal bike for picking up kids or heavy groceries, while others have a [kid's seat] on the back for that
As for how you learn - mostly, you just go to some quiet roads or an empty parking lot or whatever
Parents also often bike alongside their small kids, with a hand on their back
Also we have good bike lanes
In most schools, there's a bike test when you're around 12/13 (at least it was for me)
It's not an official license, but if you don't pass, your parents will get a message saying they need to raise you better basically, lol
You get a route to bike and then some teachers will stand throughout the city to watch if you used the correct hand signals and so on
Depends on the day and the agenda
Some days I take an holder retro 26" Mountain Bike setup with modern gears, dynamo light and a rack
Alternative is a single speed track bike with fenders and a front rack
If I need to carry speciel things then a two wheeled cargo bike
I live in Denmark
I like this reply
I used to have a “station bike” for my commute (basically a bike that lives on the train station, so i could bike from the station to uni)
I obviously had an old rusty one, so the thieves would chose to steal a better bike than mine
Oh that's interesting
Here, electric bikes, except [some Christiania bikes] are by far a minority
Many see it as "cheating" lol
Oh, another thing for OP: In Denmark at least, bike theft is incredibly common
I’ve known normal people who thinks it’s perfectly acceptable to just take an unlocked bike
But bike theft can also be big organized business - my dad once locked his bike with two locks and all, still got it stolen
Criminals drive around in big trucks, cut up locks and dump them in the truck to sell
I have actually never biked one, so I don’t really know
It has a interesting history
[Christiania] was/is an abandoned military base that was taken over by hippies
They attempted to create their “perfect society” - weed, no advertisements, and of course no cars
They said the Christiania bike would be “the car of the future”.
Imo it's not that bad
However, I've only ever tried one with an electric engine on
If GTA was set in a Danish city, bike theft would definitely be an important feature
Actually those that organize bike theft in Denmark are mostly foreigners
“My bike”
“OUR bike :))”
If I’m served raw meat I ain’t gonna eat it
This definitely doesn’t apply for Europeans in general
Other than being occupied by the nazis for a few years, I think Denmark has had its sovereignty since the kingdom was founded well over a thousand years ago
In Denmark we have two periods of being free and independent
* Around 700 to 1940
* 1945 to present
Damn Nazis, they broke our streak
I was having a conversation with someone from the US who asked if we made such a big deal out of our independence day as they do theirs, and I explained that we don't have an independence day since we've never had to become independent of anyone
Acknowledging the liberation on the 5th/6th of May is barely observed anymore, and Constitution Day is also very low-key and more political than an occasion that calls for decorations or special meals
Most of Denmark was also occupied during the Second Northern War
We were mostly saved by the Dutch and the fact that Carl Gustav died in the middle of the occupation
Soon 2020
Yikes
I'm glad the person I was speaking to wasn't *that* presumptive
Yeah
Miami, but if were restricting to Europe, then i would say Palma de Mallorca
>Oslo
Why
How did the fact that Naples is the main seat of the Camorra, the Mafia of Campania, escape you
I definitly dont disagree, but I'm surprised that a Swede would be surprised by Oslo being
well Oslo
If you were at a typical student bar on a friday or saturday I dont think they would even give it a second thought
Regardless of where you were though, No one would say anything
A friend of mine did that in *Iceland*. The first and only time she did it, although she did make a great first impression as everyone thought she was super friendly and generous
Obliviously Viking age is taught throughout, and then (depending on the teacher) you might learn about Egyptian, Greek and Roman through projects through school (ages 6 to 16)
Through religion studies you might also learn a bit about ancient Jewish culture
Then, if you take STX (upper secondary school), you will have a class called Oldtidskundskab (Ancient Knowledge/Classic Studies) which focuses on Roman and Greek culture and literature
You read stuff like the Illiad, Oedipus, Platon, Aristoteles and Herodot
You also learn about vases, statues and temples and how to tell them apart (Archaic, Hellenistic and so on)
besides the vikings and proto-Scandinavian old Norse before them, there are also the oral histories of the Inuits myths from greenland
Otherwise we also know alot about how  the earliest part of the Iron Age in Scandinavia divided between the Pre-Roman Iron Age and the Roman Iron age
There are also good evidence from the Nordic Bronze Age, who had maintained trade links with Mycenaean Greece,  actively engaged in the export of amber, and imported metals in return
We learn mostly about the Ironage people (don't really have a name), the Vikings, and then the people in the medieval age
I am from Denmark
Vikings by the way are a made up concept
Really it is the end of the Ironage and the beginning of the medieval age - but they did not call them selves Vikings
This was an idea created in the 1800s due to needing a national pride after having been beaten by wars and such
So they looked back to when we were strong, and found the time where people did a viking
A viking was not something you was, but something you did
And they named this age of pillaging and attacking and raiding for the viking age
I don't know if it's depends on the teacher  as well, but the Stone Age and Bronze Age are also taught in school, primarily focusing on the periods in a Danish context
Especially the differences in the earlier hunter-gatherer society and the agrarian society
It's probably does - outside of the nature subjects, I never was taught anything about the stone age
Though I did learn about the bronze age
When I started studying history at uni, we quickly learned that what people had been taught about in school varied widely from person to person
I've met people who never even had anything about the Vikings at school
It's wild
Like in english, it's almost silent but is pronounced like in "hello"
It is pronounced as if you are going to say hose (like in a garden hose), but you come to gutteral stop before the end: "Ho-".
And no, it's not pronounced the same way as hoe
Same for Danish - and there's no similarity with how the letter a is pronounced (the vowel sound in "cat" in Danish and the vowel sound in "car" in Norwegian)
I think would visit all the European countries but if had to pick one then I would say Italy because of the current situation that are going on in Italy right now
I have visited most, and while there aren't any that I wouldn't visit, some of those that I haven't yet visited seem far out into the future considering the other countries that I also want to visit
Langtbortistan - translates to Far away istan
Where istan is like in Pakistan
I actually think it was coined by a Donald duck translator
Yes, we use "[Langbortistan] The name was invented in 1959 by Sonja Rindom, a Danish translator of Disney cartoons
The meaning is something like "Remotistan", which was used by Disney in english
Everyone knows the meaning of Langbortistan
If you mean far away, but still in the country, older people will use "where the crows turn". Or my favourite, "where the world is extended with planks".
In addition to the other Danish versions already mentioned, we sometimes say "Hvor kraverne vender" - where the crows turn around - to refer to something far away (from civilization, sometimes, but also just far away)
In Denmark, we say “Langbortistan” which translates to something like “Very far away-istan”
Not quite the same, but in Danish, when referring to somewhere really far out in the countryside, you often say it's out on "Lars Tyndskids mark", meaning "Lars Thin-shit's (Diarrhoea's) field". Alternately, somewhere can be located "hvor kragerne vender", meaning "where the crows turn around".
This guy countries
Turkmenistan for example means Land of Turkmen - Which is the Turkic group native to Turkmenistan
I used to ‘practise work’ in one of the biggest hotels in Denmark, and probably the most prestigious and expensive . I was only 13
This Day i was working in the lounge
Which meant i’d meet tourists from all over the world
On that day alone i had two occasions
1) Australian guy who travelled alone
He was in his 50’s? He really had no plans that day, but decided he wanted someone to speak with, so he went to the desk
He decided that a young man like me was perfect
He started talking with me about a movie he Saw last night, and i kindly listened to him speaking and asking for details
He didn’t remember the title of the movie
Yet we still spent 20 min speaking about that one movie, in which he remembered 0 details from
Kind man, but it was kinda strange
2) Japanese man who worked abroad this one week was very fond of me working at such an age
He wanted selfies and videos of me so he could show it to his son which were at about my age
He wanted to show his son, that people my age do work here in Denmark
He apparently found it very inspirational
Another day i was working another job in this hotel
I was put to work at the ‘meeting room’ lounges
Here, people from all around the World came to talk very important business
Some were walking in clothes that i wouldn’t even be able to afford with a years wage
They pretty much treated me like shit, and felt as if i were a peasant
I still had to be very kind towards them ;,)
Some people also were very curious of me working, so they spent their break talking to me
I Met loads of french, english, german, swedes and americans
They were all very interested in my work, and also talked about why they were in Copenhagen
All in all i had a very interesting experience with this ‘practise work’ which i did for 3 days
Met a whole lot of different people and cultures, and i also Got some great working experience
Perhaps is
It’s a requirement that Danish teens get this experience
Here in Denmark we call it ‘praktik’, which translates roughly into ‘practise’.
Is it normal that japanese people sometimes does this
Yes
He took many pictures :)
In Denmark you can legally get a part time job at 13
It is a state-led project to let students do this ‘praktik’. Though It’s the school which decides if they’ll let their students take ‘praktik’ and for how long
Some schools offer up to 2 weeks, while others don’t even participate
And yes
My parents had to sign some paperwork in order to let me go to ‘praktik’. Even the danish military offers praktik, but you need to be a minimum of 15 to attend
I’ve had a job ‘legally’ since the day i turned 13
Wouldn’t it be called an internship
It’s the same here
But you’re 13 here when you have to do it
(Atleast my class were all 13)
Idk
It was just a guess really
Idk
My bad
Ah yes
That makes a lot of sense
Thank you very much
Don’t worry man, your internship sounded very cool unlike mine who was at magasin in the Rødovre center
I chose the work myself
Ofcourse the job you want to work at needs to accept your offer and has to sign alot of paperwork
But most companies chose to accept you, cause It’s basically free labour for a few days
My uncle is the ‘boss’ at this hotel, so i Got the spot easily
I wanted to take an internship in 9th grade too, but this time at the danish military
I was too late, and still do regret never taking the internship
I mean my second internship was at Frederiksberg tailoring a quite popular tailoring place, it was cool I guess
What hotel did you work in
At a hotel in Copenhagen called ‘Radisson Blu Scandinavia Hotel’.
Quite expensive
Oh yeah I know it, that sounds so cool
It was indeed a nice experience
Nope
Yeah, you can find it in a bunch of local papers as well
It didn't?
Okay, but was it on tv
Almost certainly on TV2 news, not likely on DR I should think, maybe on TV2 in general, was watching local news that day because of the infrastructure changes so I'm not certain
Considering that it made it into a bunch of local papers, I'd be surprised if TV2 didn't run with it, but I wasn't watching
[Danish penal code § 13]
>Acts committed in self-defence are not punishable if they were necessary to resist or
avert an unlawful attack that has begun or is imminent, provided that such acts do not
manifestly exceed what is reasonable with regard to the danger inherent in the
attack, the aggressor and the importance of the interests endangered by the attack
>(2)Any person who exceeds the limits of lawful self-defence shall not be liable to punishment if his
act could reasonably be attrib-uted to the fear or excitement produced by the attack
>(3) Similar rules shall apply to acts necessary to enforce lawful orders in a lawful
manner, to carry out a lawful arrest or to prevent the escape of a prisoner or a person
committed to an institution
The short version: You can defend yourself with the same force as you're receiving
If you use more force you might avoid punishment due to you acting in fear or because you're high on adrenaline
We were discussing some time ago if we should make pepper spray legal, if that gives you an idea
It's legal to buy now now but not to carry it with you
You can use it for home defence
Well, you are *allowed* to do it :)
TIL it's not "fiese Matenten"
edit: And after reading the [German wikipedia article] I learned that there are other similar 'background stories' for *fisimatenten* and they're probably all wrong
Just gonna latch on to this comment to keep the English ones in the same place
Not sure if they have special stories but I'm fascinated by article rebracketing: *apron*, *adder*, *nickname* and *umpire* are all examples of article fuck ups
They derive from *naperon*, *nǣddre, ekename* and *nonper -* it should have been "a napron", "a nadder", "an ickname" and "a numpire" today, but enough people misallocated the "n" for the mistake to catch on and change the word
In Danish, "øgenavn" is the word for a nickname or derisive name
It comes from Norse "aukanafn", i.e. "ickname"
Because the same thing happened in Dutch, it was *nadra in Old Dutch
Well do you know what happened in 1349
I know this because of the band
Well actually people mated and produced more people indeed, but we ended up with less people due to illness
*CK2 INTENSIFIES*
Jokes aside monarchs nowdays have little to no power over such matters
I believe even through referendums it's very difficult for unification of two nations these days
you kinda have that already with Canada and UK having the same monarch
I don't think it would work in modern times since monarchs are more figureheads than rulers of the country
Not really since most, if not all, of the royal families are just symbolic, so it would have to be approved in both of the countries political establishment for anything to happen
I think the royal families actively try to avoid this because of all the shenanigans involved
And what about their child, which is heir to both countries
But their children would be the interesting point
Because they would obviously be heir to monarchies, therefore creating a personal union
It would probably work like the British Commonwealth, with the two nations still remaining separate, but would be interesting
>So is it like Scotland where they are a country but just not independent
Perhaps more like Puerto Rico
The Dutch territories are a special case, because the Dutch constitution is not supreme to the charter granting the territories their rights
>Curaçao and St
Maarten are like Canada to the UK: independent states with the same head of state
You are not an independent country, if you are part of an independent country (the Kingdom of the Netherlands)
Canada is not part of the UK but share the monarch as head of state
Usually after 18 or 19 but most people take a year or more off (sabbatår) before startining university to travel or work or both
18-19
Many do take a couple or more gap years for work and travel before going on to university
It's also quite common to go to Højskole on your Sabbatår, though some also go later in life
I think the average age of when you start uni is getting lower, though
I remember when I first started uni, there were zero people in my year below the age of 20 - personally I was 20 and I was the youngest in my year, with most being 25+. Then when I later started my second bachelor, (at 22), I was one of the oldest in my year suddenly, with most being around 18-20
Norway have 3 land borders: Sweden, Finland and Russia
None of them are NATO members, so they are not exactly surrounded by allies, but it's not like they are expecting an assault from Finland or Sweden anytime soon :-)
Conscription is also mandatory here in Denmark (only for men), but almost all spots are taken by volunteers, so it is only a very small number who is "forced in" each year - and it is only four months
Personally I would very much like to see it made entirely voluntary, like it is for women
Who do you pay to dodge it
How does that work
Copenhagen got its name in the middle ages
Kaupmannahafn is the oldest record of the current name which means Merchants' harbour
Odense (Denmark)
It comes from "Odins samt vi" which translates roughly into "Odin Together We" or "Odin's Shrine". Yes, it's also gibberish in Danish
It's said to be the city of Odin, the Norse god
Ribe, oldest town in Denmark, dating back to the 8th century
Back then it used to be called "Ripa" which is believed to come from the Latin word for riverside
TIL thx
Still "Kaupmannahöfn" in Icelandic, the language frozen in time
(And can we just use this opportunity to once again make clear that the Danish name for Copenhagen is not *Kopenhaaaagen
* What you're doing there, Mr
Worldwide, is trying to talk German
It's København in Danish - you can't pronounce it, don't worry about it, just say "Copenhagen")
You can be anything you want if you don't say Sjøpnhamn - that initial K has done nothing wrong, it just want to live its life and be respected as a K, a hard and proud sound
I mean that's probably quite close, assuming the language you're coming from is German
English-speakers can't because they lack the vowel ø/ö. There's also the presence of *stød*, which makes basically any foreign attempt to pronounce it wrong
Are you saying Danish has more *plattdüütsche* loanwords than Swedish and Norwegian
I have never noticed a difference besides the word for *window* and that is *fönster* in Swedish but *vindue* in Danisch (and I think Norwegian)
Edit: This is so great
I just looked up window in Icelandic and of course it is *gluggi* and has nothing to do with *vindue*, but there's also the word *vindauga* which basically means wind-eye
That's a lot closer to the letter Å than Ø, at least in terms of the Danish pronounciation
The v isn't lost really
It's just pronounced as a *u*. It's probably the *stød* on the preceding a that confuses you
There's a stød in *København*?
Depends on your dialect
But I say it like this  [kʰøb̥m̩ˈhɑʊ̯ˀn]
> do the spindles
Purr is called "spinde" in Danish
Same in Danish
DTU (Denmark’s Technical University)
It’s very good because everybody’s so nice and the teacher are very professional
Depends on what you wanna study, but if you wanna study business
Then, Copenhagen Business School is the place to go, not just for Denmark, but for all of Scandinavia
We've only got a few universities in little Denmark
the best are probably Aarhus university and Copenhagen university
They've got a lot of good people working there and do some great studies too
The University of Copenhagen is ranked as the highest in Denmark according to:
Depends on the degree
The Logistics & Supply-Chain Management from BSS is considered the best programme in that field in Denmark for example
In my opinion it’s the best, but it does depend on what you are studying
Aarhus, right
Yep
Aarhus is good, aswell
But as an overall institution, I think CBS is better
I used to be really scared of Nøkken as a kid - I grew up next to a bog on one side and a forest on the other, my parents would tell me about different creatures living there to entertain me and make me behave
Do you guys also have Mosekonen in Sweden
She is basically a woman who creates fog by brewing a big pot of food, which makes people get lost and walk into either the forest or rivers and bogs
She's quite closely connected to Lygtemanden and Ellerpiger, as they need her to create the fog for them to lure people, so often they work together
Even our weathermen will go "Mosenkonen brygger" if there's a thick fog coming :)
I  thought Nøkken wears a suit
At least in the Danish folklore I've heard/read he does
I've been only been able to find him either to be described wearing clothes made of fish:
"Og hvad fortæller klokken
Den er så gammel, så gammel, er der sagt, den var til, længe før mormors mormor blev født, og dog er den i alder et barn kun imod åmanden, der er en gammel, en stille, en underlig én med åleskindsbukser og skælfiskstrøje med gule åkander i, siv om håret og andemad på skægget og det er just ikke kønt
and "fancy clothes":
"though often imagined as fair and naked today, in folklore he was more frequently described as wearing more or less elegant clothing"
Also, Näcken or Nøkken actually originally comes from Nykr which means "River horse" in Old Norse
Also there's absolutely no reason why you should be rude to me like you were, simply because I've been raised with, and have read, different stories than you
You literally did not mention anything about the difference between the two - instead to ridiculed the idea that Nøkken might be wearing a suit by comparing it to saying Santa Claus might wear blue overalls - if you feel like what you did was compare the two yet say "both versions are still equally valid" I suggest rereading your messages and see how they might be read by someone, not in your mind
They come off as very rude
Road trip movies were they drive for HOURS
this country is so small
you can drive from one end to the other in a day
and almost nobody would
and if you're in the northern part and wanna go to copenhagen, you'd fly
it's like 30 minutes
Not so much due to societal structures, but more due to norms:
the whole "bad teenager having sex and/or drinking" thing in either horror movies or teen dramas doesn't really work here
It's a very acceptable thing here that teens have sex and drink - house parties are something you have with your parents knowledge, often around 16-18 before you are old enough for bars and clubs
Have a boyfriend/girlfriend and having sex with them at around 15 to 16 is more normal than not
Now imagine catholic Lord of the Rings:
"... and one ring to bind them all in darkness, and one Pope to keep the ring-owner in check
Norwegian Mad Max would be a dull movie
You'd find a way to make the Euro legal tender in space

I don't recognize Tolkien as the author of LOTR
Poirot is just so fucking cool
Of course we want to imitate him
There's not really a standard dialect in Denmark
Meaning there was one, but no one really knows it or can agree on what it is, so we just speak to each other in all our different dialects
This sometimes results in two Danes not being able to understand each other
Idk, I know plenty of people my age (20s)that still speak thybomål or sønderjysk, who are able to turn it on and off
No, I don't think I've ever heard anyone be asked to speak clearly either
Though I think that's because they already automatically switch from the dialects, without being asked
Like my bf speaks thybomål with her family, but regular danish with me, since I don't know all the words of thybomål
I thought that was Vendelbo
Yeah, I used to switch all the time when I lived in Copenhagen
Especially because if I didn't, people would repeat what I was saying back at me in "my accent" and laugh
Both my grandparents spoke thybomål, so I do understand a lot of it when spoken, but can't speak or understand all of it
Yeah, I'm from Kronjylland, so my accent it pretty well-known, though we do have words and terms that are unique to us, plus I do use for thybomål and vestjysk expressions in my everyday language, but people zeroed in on it straight away, and all thought it was hilarious
I'm just glad (though also quite annoyed), I'm female, so at least for me it was mostly something people thought was "cute" or "attractive", whereas my male friends were often told they sounded "aggressive" or "unintelligent"
I was born and raised in Midtjylland, but my dads parents had lived all of their lives on Langeland
When I was a kid back in the 80's and early 90's and we visited them, I had a really hard time understanding anything
I would usually look to my dad, and he would try to discreetly nod or shake his head, to let me know how to respond
They both died in the mid 90's, and I never got to spend a lot of time with them, since we usually only visited a few days during the summer
I would love to have had a recording of them, both for my personal memories, but also to have saved their dialect, since it is almost gone
My dad (who is 82) can't really speak the dialect anymore, only a few odd words
I remember it being much more unintelligible than this:
Kimse is a great word, up there with grat and makværk
I use them all regularly
Honestly, from living in Copenhagen for 10 years, my experience is that many Copenhageners think of their dialect as "standard Danish" and 100% subscribe to elitist bullcrap, even when they claim to be left wing
Why do you think the most shit on cities and areas in Denmark, are the areas that are mostly working class, and are shit on due to stuff associated with stereotypes about the working class
Elitism is thriving
I know the feeling
My granddad from my mums side is from Als and speak a very heavy Alsisk, and I just have never understood it
So as a kid I always had to sort of either look at (or ask) my parents, or pick out words and hope I got the gist of what he was saying  thank god for youtube being able to help us disporia kids expirence some nostalgia and hopefully get better at understanding
I'm surprised though, I probably got maybe 90-95% of what the woman was saying, and I've never been to Langeland
Currency
I'm strongly in favor of everyone using Euros
But many rules are specialised for different places, and so it would make no sense to universalise them
In Denmark, for example, it is a law requirement to always have car lights on
This is because it’s so often overclouded and dark even when it’s summer, so by law, it’s far safer if they’re always on
In Spain though, this would be a tremendous waste of electricity
I think the first step would just be to implement it everywhere
Tons of countries don't have proper bottle and can return systems
But how will this be implemented
Will we force companies to only pay at a certain cap even though they might be willing to pay more for local skilled labour
And if so, what is stopping the companies from giving non-cash benefits instead
well the minimum wage in poland has increased over the past years
maybe we see that happening in romania and ukraine now
could take a while though
>The only state I know of getting around this rule even though they are eligible for the currency is Denmark
And the UK
It is because we have the euro opt-out, so we are not required to adopt the Euro
> The only state I know of getting around this rule even though they are eligible for the currency is Denmark
I think the UK as well, iirc
You're obligated to adopt the Euro once you meet certain conditions
It's called the [convergence criteria] The EU does care (kinda), it's just your country hasn't meet the criteria
Even if you do, you can pull a Sweden and just kinda not adopt the Euro
That's why you have to meet the [Convergence criteria] first
I'm not saying everyone over night should use the Euro just like that
Just that everyone (eventually) using Euros would be a good thing
You are legally obliged to join Schengen
[But you haven't lived up to the conditions set forth in the past] So it's not like the EU doesn't want to let you join Schengen it seems like they won't because they believe there isn't enough  anti-corruption measures
However, there was [a vote in Dec
2018] where the European Parliament decided to let Romania into the Schengen zone
Ahh I see
I misunderstood your comment
I thought you meant it as something to be enforced, but you meant it as something that would be optimal
> when it's very convenient for western EU gov'ts to score political points by acting tough on the Schengen issue
I completely agree
It's never as simple as 'yes you meet the requirements of course you can join
[Melboller] (flour buns)
It’s just dough based on flour and butter, boiled in small chunks
They’re eaten in a soup of hen broth, meatballs, carrots, leek and parsnips
I love it so much, perfect soup for a cold winter day
Old-style æbleskiver
A piece of apple sorrounded by a pancake-like batter
Raisin buns or chocolate buns
There were a song comparing those preferring raisin to Hitler
"Krebinetter" or "karbonader".
Literally the same thing (a crunchy meatball), but the name is the most significant cultural divide of Denmark
that song is correct
raisins in buns are a disgrace and should be thrown into the øresund
There aren't two camps on that subject
There are those who are wrong, and those who eat chocolate buns
raisins are underrated
stop giving in to group pressure
Stik mig en Thor
Flat side representin'
I was literally thinking about this 'war' this morning, as I was buttering my knækbrød. As I'd put it on my plate, I'd accidentally put it cavity-side up, and I thought: "anyone who butters the cavity side is idiots
It's like that thing in Sweden with the debate on which side".
Why not both
r/firstworldanarchists
Boo, hiss
no there are two types of buns with small brown bits in denmark: raisin buns and chocolate buns
raisin buns trick you into thinking that it's chocolate, but leaves you with a foul surprise
You could pile more stuff on top
But it just feels wrong
But it's immoral

Until and unless the EU becomes a proper, single nation, I will want my own nation's passport
I don't really care either way
As long as it does at least as much as my current one, I am satisfied
No, it should just make it clear that it is a passport from a country in the European Union, like it already does with the text
We'll see how Indyref 2 goes in a year or three
As soon as Brexit goes through, I expect Indyref 2 will happen the day after

"Scotland" is an ancient name, with proud roots
Just stick to that

Rasmus Paludan, obviously
He formed his own party called stram kurs
He’s been hosting “demonstrations” where he goes around Copenhagen and burns the Quran
He’s recently been banned from doing this, mostly for his own safety, since the threat of someone attacking him has been quite high recently
> where he goes around Copenhagen
Mostly in Copenhagen, yes
but he actually have demonstrations in all parts of Denmark - as long as it's got a so called "Ghetto" with lots of muslims
he does it only to provoke
>he does it only to provoke
Disagreed, he does it to demonstrate how muslims act when faced with disagreeing opinions and how they tend to use violence as a measure to stop people from voicing these opinions
Sure I don't agree with his opinions, but it's damn smart and almost worked
Doesn’t he do it mostly in nørrebro
And there’s also those stories where he goes and visits schools and gymnasiums
Never thought about like that, but that’s still kind of messed up
Definitely messed up
In denmark we have that too with the “normal” rules
Same in Denmark
Don't know that variant, but I've done cowboy, ninja, bear: cowboy shoots the bear, bear mauls ninja and ninja sneaks up on cowboy
Accshully, Well is strictly better than Rock (wins and loses against the same things as Rock, plus beats Rock) so if you play with Well, you should never choose Rock
Theoretically that makes the game fair again, as everybody chooses between Well, Paper and Scissor so there are only three choices like in the beginning
we got a set budget of exactly 535 euro per month
This is for me, my GF, her kid at 12 and my kid, who's 5 - but my kid is only here every 2nd week
Some months we spend 80% of the budget and some months we lack a few euros in the end
we used to have the budget at ~400 euro but it was way too low
not that we were starving, but we had to think about the budget and what we ate
Seven dollars a MONTH
You've got to be shitting me
“Denmark is a socialist country”
Denmark is a socialist country
Denmark and other Nordic countries has a welfare state but Denmark is very capitalistic
The whole economic foundation is capitalistic
Well, sadly you get [this] in a lot of countries

This is not stupidity, it's a political strategy to pander to stupid people
No I wouldn't, you should reside somewhere to be allowed to vote in its elections
I just visited Austria for a week and spoke German the entire time
The same would obliviously be the case for any other German-adjacent country
Other than that, and the Scandinavian countries, I'd probably have to switch to English
My French level is sub-par, and my Italian never grew beyond casual conversing with family members when I was a kid
And being able to say "uncle, can you pass me the salt
" really doesn't cut it
I would be fine in the nordics, Spain, and somewhat Germany
I don't know if they would understand my Spanish in Italy
I think it depends on consciously using primarily the Latin derived words whenever it's possible
I think Finland Swedish is one of the easiest Swedish accents
It's very pronounced
The hardest is probably Dalarna
What the fuck are they saying
Finlandssvensk is one of the more easy variants of Swedish in my opinion
I understand the majority, but I also know the story well
I have to carry some form of legitimate photo ID (usually a passport) which *will* be checked if I want to travel to other parts of my own country, so maybe not as smooth as most places
You can just drive over the border using the small roads
They're not controlled at all
In Danmark Dansk Folkeparti had been waiting for a reason to implement border control
The migrant crisis was that reason
They don't think a country without border control is a real country (I guess)
It costs us a shitload of money and doesn't really do anything
The mostly stop cars that are loaded to heavy
> you know, “drugs” could happen
Where did you hear that
Every party in favor of the border control takes great pride in the fact that they do it to keep out those pesky muslims
>10m high
I dont think its 10m, but officilly its for boars (which can carry disease, specificlly  hoot-and-Mouth Disease which we dont have in Denmark, and we have a significant pork industrty, so getting it would be very bad), it will have holes in it anyway for smaller wildlife, so its not like it will stop anything
Don't give them any good ideas
Our "temporary border control" will getting extended indefinitely
In fact, we just put up "temporary border control" against sweden too
I think you're having us confused with the US
It is a 1,5m boar fence
Not that there isn't plenty of other stupid shit going on at the border these days, though
The fence isn't going across roads
Also; it's not very tall
You could just jump over it
The pork flu in China has been great for Danish export
I kinda get wanting to protect it
Yeah, but it was downgraded to the boar fence
We arent ready to defend ourselves and you arent ready to invade us
Jump ~ Climb over
That's just my choice of words bring imprecise
I would probably be able to climb over the fence without much trouble

Prut doesn't have a dual meaning in Swedish

When I lived Copenhagen
Depends on where you walk
I've had my wallet stolen once at a station near Nørrebro, though the guy did give it back to me when I asked
As a woman there are also areas I avoid walking alone if I can help it
Though generally I'm not scared at all
I recently moved back to my hometown Randers (Denmarks 6th biggest city) and here I feel very safe no matter where in town I am
Don't think I've ever seen or heard about anything happen to anyone
Copenhagen
On a weekday completely walkable
On friday and saturday nights i would stay away from the northern parts
Copenhagen is generally pretty safe, I avoid Thorsgade, Istedgade and Nordvest and the only time anything bad has happened was a catcall from two boys sitting on a bench
Three girls who had been talking to them from behind then slapped them on the back of the head and told them off
Copenhagen
As a guy i have never felt scared walking in the middle of the night, but I do know that some of my girl friends have to follow each other to the closest spot for each of them out of fear
I do not live in a city or town just on a farm, which makes it walkable at no night but there is nothing to see out here in west Jutland
Same in all of Danmark
Do right-wing extremists attack random women
I think I just baffled him so much by asking for it back quite sternly
I'm a 162cm woman who was on my own in an empty station, so I don't think I scared him tbh
He just sort of spun a tale about how "he found it on the ground and was going to give it to me", but 5 seconds before he had literally knocked into me and I felt him take it out of my pocket since my hand was in the pocket as well
I don't know what happened in my head, but I just got really angry and spoke to him like I used to speak to the kids I used to babysit
Apparently that worked
Probably a really stupid thing to do in general though, and I don't recommend it to anyone
Many young men who are out of pedagogical reach
The North-West has many MENA immigrants
Don't go there with a MAGA cap, far right symbols in general or look Jewish
Women in very short skirts could also get unwanted attention/comments from MENA immigrants
Also Outer Nørrebro is worse than Inner Nørrebro
I've seen a guy with a kippah in Silvan at Nørrebro station, so take the "don't look Jewish" with a grain of salt
I would like to think I don't take up that much space that people can't avoid knocking into me in stations, but perhaps I have a warped self-image  I knew I shouldn't have gotten my mirror from the Tivoli Fun-House
Here is a [Wikipedia page] about it, but as it also says there are no clear borders nor any official demarcation
It's not super bad compared to other countries, but it still stand out in a Danish perspective
Nørrebro is also in common language divided between Inner Nørrebro, which is "hip", and Outer Nørrebro which is part of the "North-West" and not so hip
DTU (Lyngby) is way North of this and is not even in Copenhagen Municipality
When I say *way North,* Lyngby is actually only 20 min or so from Copenhagen Central station with the city train
Ah that's it
He was too shy to ask for my name, so he wanted to look at my ID instead
Subjective of course but I would say first city to get bombarded with missiles ever
Copenhagen
When it partially burnt down because of political tension
RAF bombed by request of the Danish resistance the dorms at the University of Aarhus in 1944 because Gestapo had their local headquarter there
75 people died
Also, the first and so far only school shooting happened at the university in 1994, where a man shot at women specifically and killed two before he shot himself
Varde, Denmark
Quite small town, but because of our river, we have been a kinda "Trading Capital" in Denmark
The city has burned down, to dirt and ash 3 times
This is the reason why we had the best firestation in the country, and the town is old, but the buildings are new
The arrival of the Railway, and the establishment of the radio factory
Probably a couple of high school students who in 1971 created the first Roskilde Festival, which today is the second largest rock music festival in Europe
Before that probably the protestant reformation in 1536, which removed Roskilde's status as the largest and most important city in Denmark
The cathedral continued to be the preferred location for the entombment of the Danish monarchs, but apart from that most of the other religious institutions disappeared, churches and monasteries were torn down etc
The Danish nobility also got anxious and disposed him, because what were to stop that madlad from doing it to them too
Sweden stab stab
Which city
I know that the museum Rungstedlund is dedicated to the preservation of Karen Blixen's home and some of her art
But I don't think they have a monopoly on her literary work
Edit: as it is pointed out in a comment in this thread, they do in fact have the rights to her work
Koda & Gramex for music, and Copydan ( for other creative works
Though design patents for applied art ( such as designer furniture, kitchen equipment, tableware)  are valued highly, and has significant cultural importance
They also seem to own the rights to her work
In 2032 they become free to use for all
In Denmark, an authors copyrights expire 70 years after their death
That is also why nobody owns the rights to H.C. Andersens original fairytales today, but publishers can have rights to "modern translations".
Gift in Danish means both married and poison
I have one for Polish and Danish
Tak is thanks in danish and yes in polish
slut, fart and gift apply to danish as well
Stay away from the cycling lanes, if you come to Denmark (unless you are riding a bike)
I can't say much that hasn't already been said by other comments, but I can add that a good idea is to research the countries you'll be visiting - especially in regards to social expectations
for example, here in the north openly talking to strangers and/or otherwise being loud will be seen quite negatively, and will *not* make you popular
I believe there is also something in France about saying "hello"/"goodbye" when entering and exiting shops
Just don't be pushy and have respect for the culture and generally everything
And as always, be polite
Don't randomly talk to people in public or take the seat next to theirs
Respect the local values
I forgot to mention this
Me neither
What does it mean
Is it about how loud one should be talking
Don't they say half past three
That's what I remember learning
If you don't mind, when has anything good ever come out of somebody losing their temper
I mean, as a Nordic the cheek kiss is absolutely horrifying
If that's the case, explain how i'm able to eat food right now
Close enough
Depending on the part of Copenhagen that you want to live in, you can either get an about 45 sqm apartment, or about 100 sqm near the outer edges of the capitol area
Move an hour or so out of Copenhagen(in the right direction), and you can get 240 sqm
In Copenhagen I would say Nyhavn
Not so much going to the area, that I always recommend, but eating there
It's expensive and you can easily find better not that far away
That being said, you of course pay for the privilege of eating at Nyhavn mostly, so if you are willing to do that, fair enough
Also, the Little Mermaid is basically a joke among Danes by now
Every tourist has to see it, and every tourist will be disappointed
In my hometown Randers, we only really have two tourist places
An indoor rainforest, which is totally worth the money
And an Elvis museum which is build to look like his home in Memphis, which is expensive and not worth the money
Legoland in Billund, Denmark
Expensive as heck, rides are half assed
Honestly only good part of it is going to the mini world and seeing all the small lego houses, but even so, the price is way to expensive for what you get
Food is not great either
Yet
With all this said, I go about once or twice a year
Because honestly, we don't have a lot of other things around, and friends visiting from other countries really want to see it
You still get a fine day
It's always a bit pretending to have fun
In my childhood it was the greatest thing ever, but I've been in load of parks now that does theme parking way better
Like Disneyland
But to be fair, I haven't really been in that many other Danish parks, so can't even tell you which one you should rather go to
I would add Strøget, the pedestrian street off the Town Hall Square
I don't know how much of a unique concept it is anymore now that more towns and cities are being pedestrianised and efforts are being made to cut down on motor traffic
Decades ago, that was what it was famous for, but now, meh
All the shops and restaurants on that street are either huge international chains or tacky, expensive souvenir shops
It's a major thoroughfare for people trying to get to other places, so it's often very busy with tourists (well, normally) and locals alike
If you want to find people getting scammed by Three-card Monte games, random vendors selling worthless plastic toys, pickpockets, the occasional beggar, and/or awful street performers, definitely head for Strøget
I'd highly recommend walking down one of the streets that run more or less parallel to Strøget, a block or two out, instead
Or just turn a few corners and see what's there: that part of super central Cph is crammed with all sorts of bars, restaurants, cafés, independent stores, offices, music venues, hotels, churches, cool timber-framed houses, regular peoples' private residences, and even schools and university buildings, so it's not like a CBD where you *only* find boring office blocks with a few chain coffee shops dotted around
Randers Rainforest is defo worth a visit
Once got season tickets for my daughter and me as a xmas present; she loved going like every 4-8 weeks
Fårup and Djurs Sommerland are both pretty good
Depends on the day
Sometimes there are so many tourist around it that you can't get anywhere near it without spending time standing in line
It certainly isn't a thing that you should prioritise seeing, it took me several years of living in Copenhagen to see it
It's kinda like seeing the Sherlock Holmes statue in London
It's nice, do it if you are nearby, but otherwise don't bother
The Little Mermaid statue is kinda a joke by now in Denmark
It's small, faraway, and quite simple
I mean, it's a nice statue, but the area surrounding it has more value than the statue
Hell, there's even better statues [just around the corner ]
Agreed
My grandfather used to take me and my brother twice a year, and we both loved it every time
I still always take friends from out-of-town whenever they visit the city
Such an interesting concept
Honestly it's just a weird rich guy who decided to build a 3,5 million euro museum for all the stuff he collected about Elvis throughout his life
The cafe is supposed to be good, though a bit gross since it sells all of Elvis' favourite foods
I haven't heard about that, but it's lost its head a couple of times, as well as its arms and been painting red and stuff
But it one in public is a copy of the original one anyway, so it isn't really that much of an issue, the real one is in possession of the heirs to the guy who made it in some secret location
Rundetårn I like - it's a good way to see the city, plus the building is interesting
In general a lot of the touristy places in Copenhagen (Amalienborg, Marmorkirken, Tivoli, Christiania) are all worth their salt, especially is the weather is nice
Well, you sort of hit a sore point about Randers
It's not really crime ridden or a shit hole (in fact most statistics says crime here is among the lowest in Denmark), but it's generally stereotyped to be filled with uncultured, aggressive and violent people - both as a joke and because people honestly believe so
As it is, most of that is due to it being a mostly working class city, which carries with it a lot of prejudices
As a local who takes public transport from CPH Central Station all the time, I still find it kind of a trip to be able to see the rollercoasters and other rides peeking over the wall and hear people shrieking while I'm just standing around waiting for a bus
Having a full amusement park right smack in the centre of town is really quite strange
Depends - I know plenty of areas in Copenhagen that's basically half the price of Nyhavn with higher quality of food and service, but if you eat near Strøget, Kongen Nytorv (though there are some cheaper places near KN), Tivoli and similar, you eat in the places tourist do, so it's more expensive
If you are able to find the non-touristy spots it's still more expensive that the rest of Denmark, but it's less so than Nyhavn and the likes
True - I have only visited München once to go to the Oktoberfest, and I had a blast
We were a weird bunch of people who all met through couchsurfing
org and a local guy who I think was sort of famous (a tv-host or something)
He got us a big table in one of the halls and we all learned a lot of German drinking songs
We had people from the US
, Argentina, Egypt, The Philippines, England, Italy, Slovakia and myself from Denmark at the table
Yeah, just wasnt bothered to pay for the food there
I always made a nice lunch for us from home to eat there - i live almost an hour up north, but my sister lives out in stevnstrup so always combined the rainforest with a visit to her and her family
(Nice free dinner haha)
I think most people in my generation picked up on the stereotype with the mokai and scooter memes that were viral 6-7 years ago on facebook
I mean, I can't really think of any major city in Denmark that isn't primarily working class
Herning, Aalborg, Esbjerg, all known for industry and work, but doesn't have the same stereotype
I like going there for a walk, at least
It's lovely when the weather is nice
Great idea
I grew up in Hornbæk, just on the edge of town, so we just always either ate at home, or at my grandparents' home since they lived in Dronningborg
Now that I'm an adult, when I go I always take my friends to Cafe Jens Otto after, since it's my favourite place in town (cheap, good food and amazingly hygge decor)
I imagine the food in Regnskoven is very expensive and not really worth it though, so it's good that they allow packed lunch
My dad had the stereotypes about him as well in the 70s and 80s, and when my mum moved here in the 90s she knew about them as well  like the Randers meme thing was just the new evolution of it
I mean, I've experienced it my whole life and I'm in my late 20s now
Also, Herning, Aalborg and Esbjerg did used to have the same stereotypes about them, the Randers ones just became persistent due to a meriad of things, like comedians mostly using Randers as the basis for their "stupid/violent/poor people" jokes, the meme page, that video that became popular in early the noughties, and so on
Oh, yeah, nothing against it at all, it's just odd/unusual when you stop and consider it
Ohmy, i have been at cafe jens otto with my sister
She had their æggekage and i had the stjerneskud iirc, great place, great food, great servers
To care about insignificant details in Danish is called Flueknepperi, translated to fucking flies
In Danish they're mariehøner, Mary hens
Maybe someone else knows why we brought chickens into it, but I don't.
we just write in english, unless it's on the country subs
getting it automatically translated would likely give some strange results
english is fine
but MOST posts and memes on /r/denmark are in danish
i've not seen complaints when someone asks a question, or comments, in english though :)
I use English
Writes in English and most also talks in English online
Looking at the grammar used when American teens text each other, i'd go as far as to say that a lot of European countries probably have a better grasp of English grammar than Americans do
Nope hahah would be pretty if I’d just be spitting out danish words expecting some kind of translation
Nej, som du kan se her, bliver de ikke oversat automatisk
Men gid de gjorde - mit engelske er en smule rustent
Other than by screaming and running over each other with autocampers
well, the wording _is_ a bit off
I'd say it would be:
"vi skriver bare på engelsk, medmindre det er på landesubs'ne/landenes subs
at få det automatisk oversat ville nok give nogle sære resultater"
Vi sittar her i ventaen og spillar lita DOTA
That sounds ridiculous
can someone explain what that sub is about
I've looked at it and am pretty confused
Are you sure you are not Austrian
Looks like an Austrian version of r/dankmark or r/DANMAG
could tell
well to be fair danish is fairly close to english so its easier to translate 1 to 1
yep, waay better
if you translate entire pages I would recommend the google translate addon for chrome; it makes things a lot easier
what has my comment lead to
mobile translate has the option to translate from a picture, which has saved me a countless amount of times
I think I'm a bit lost at what you mean
nope, it's part of the google translate app on ios/android
you can either scan or choose a picture, which is super neat
We use the word “stueetage” for the ground floor and call the floor above that 1st floor
As a software developer I'm happy to report that we use Zero indexed floors in Denmark
First floor is the one above ground floor
We do it the same way too
Out of all the things they get wrong, I have to give it to the Americans on this one
The first floor you walk into is, well, the first floor
“Stuen” is street level or ground floor
First floor is the one above it
If you translate *Erste Obergeschoss* literally into English, does it not mean something like *first overfloor*? That seems like a nice way to make sense of them: Floor, overfloor, underfloor
"Stueetage" meaning living room floor
Not the answer you're looking for, but *my* literal translation of Obergeschoss would be *over-bullet*, and I have no idea why it's called *Geschoss*
Wait, you guys really say *Geschoß*??? It rhymes with *Moos*?
The pH scale here in denmark
Nothing is Scandinavian
We are no better than our ~~african~~ viking ancestors
Well it depends
Administratively Denmark is divided in to five regions with pretty boring names, North Jutland, Middle Jutland, South Denmark, Sealand, and the capital Region
However on a more local level areas seems to have more interesting  names such as Crown Jutland, Vendsyssel, Djurs and Hanherred
We have a lot of funny city names as well
Most foreginers notice **Middelfart** and **Lolland**, but some are also funny in Danish such as **Sæd** (semen), **Lem** (penis), **Tarm** (intestine), **Røved** (ass oath) and **Helved** (hell)
We got a place called "sæd"
which means cum
We also got Ølsted
which means "Beer location"
And "Røved" which means "ass oath"
well, depending on how you translate them
edit: And Pikhede
Pik = Cock
Hede = moor
In Denmark there the 5 administrative regions Northern Jutland, Central jutland, Southern Denmark, Zealand and the Capital Area
Bonus: We have the football clubs FC Central Jutland, FC Northern Zealand, Soutern Jutland Elite sport and we used to have FC Western Zealand
And don't forget Høm (poop)
In Danish it means small butt cheek
We don't. But just as in German you can put random words together to make a new one
Non of the cities are named after these things
Their old names just happen o be the same as these words
Cool
It will be interesting to see what happens next
Namme namme, pepperonipizza med drille ️
(Nom nom, pepperoni pizza with dressing)
Garlic sauce is pretty common, and kebab sauce with kebab pizza
Swedes have truly perfected the art of how to ruin a pizza
Ketchup for fries
We have mayo for that tho
Nope
Not gonna try banana curry pizza either
Pros: high standard of living, liberal culture, little to no corruption in politics, very little inequality
Cons: living in the countryside is depressing as shit, and it's an overall inconvenient country (stores close early, no uber, taxis are expensive as fuck, it takes 2 weeks for your package to arrive if you ordered online) and the weather
Pris: healthcare & free education to name a few
Cons: high tax, but it's worth it
Another con: Malmö
And the country is one giant field and it smells like pig shit
Most stores close either around 19, or even 20 or 21 (grocery stores even later), I honestly don't think that's too late
Who did you get to deliver Post Nord
Because I've never heard of anyone having to wait that long unless it was Post Nord or a Wish package
It's mostly the rain and darkness I dont like
If it was 10 degrees and sunny all the time I wouldn't mind it
I was mostly referring to Post Nord
Okay, makes sense then
An angelmaker (englemager) in Danish is a person who kills small children and infants for profit
The most famous one took orphans in and was paid by the government to take care of them, but killed a lot of them and kept collecting the money
Another example could be for insurance
Not sure if it counts as patriotic but born in the usa
I learned "Tomorrow belongs to me" once when I was in a local production of Cabaret
It's a beautiful song, but sadly was very popular with neo groups soon after it was published
I've had to stop myself from humming it in public a couple of times
I always liked Swedens national anthem "Du gamla, Du fria"... And I'm Danish
"Ja, jag vill leva jag vill dö i Norden
Can relate
I really like your point of view, i respect all the other answers but yours really made me think
I think i speak for a lot of Europe, please vote in November
Honestly, i wish you the best and please get that clown out
I would love to see the day that a progressive Turkey throws away Erdoğan and joins the EU
I'm actially sort of interested to hear this: What is the prevailling view of Atatürk in Turkey at the moment
I live in a community with a lot of Turkish immigrants, and eventhough they mostly support Erdoğan, it seems they are still very fond of Atatürk
It seems a bit paradoxical
I really love Turkey, Turkish music and Turkish history, but I haven't talked to a non immigrant about the current views in Turkey
> But this doesn't mean they're not Europeans, right
This just means antisemitism was widely spread in Europe for a loooong time
I think an important addition here is that, while the Jews were not perceived as being local by most locals, many Jews did view themselves as European
So Jews in Germany often viewed themselves as German, even if others didn't see them that way
> But I don't think you can't be European just because you belong to a specific religion
That's a whole big can of worms
Part of the issue is that the whole premise of "religion" here is essentially an early-modern, Western Protestant construct
Tom Holland covers this in his book Dominion, but "Judaism" as separated from "the Jewish race" weren't separate concepts until the last few centuries
Until then, the two were integrally connected
It was only when modernising, centralising states began forcing the Jews to register their religion as an isolated thing on censuses that the idea of a dichotomy between Jewish ethnicity and religion arose
Yeah, that's what I've heard of the German Turks, it seems to be sort of the same here, but a little more progressive, perhaps because we have a lot of Kurds as well
The fire on the ferry Scandinavian Star, april 7
1990
Sailing from Frederikshavn (Denmark) to Oslo (Norway)
159 dead
Tragic on it’s own, but the real mystery is what actually happened that night
It’s still being debated/discussed in public and media 30 years later
The reason being that it might have been arson and that would make the arsonist Scandinavias worst serial killer, who has never been caught
It’s grown into a lot of conspiracy theories as to why it happened and investigation has been difficult and riddled with flaws because of the Norwegian, Swedish and Danish authorities not being able to work together
A lot of different theories exists and earlier this year a new 6 piece documentary (by Danish national tv DR, Norwegian NRK and Swedish TV4 Sverige) aired and sparked new interest in the mystery
On May 9th 2020, the documentary led to a majority of the Danish parliament voting to initiate a government hearing
Among the questions are: what is the status of the case and what is being done to achieve closure
At the harland & wolff, yes
Medisterpølse I guess
Good medister can only be bought during Christmas time and that shit is fucking amazing
Rest is just meh compared
A Danish pastry in Denmark
Sure we'll have some Wienerbrød as we call it if you're like having a coffee with friends
But I see a lot of people outside Denmark think it is like breakfast or something like that
But, we usually eat fairly healthy breakfasts like oats or yogurt, maybe open faced sandwiches
Been a while since I had Wienerbrød. Maybe I should go get some later
In Denmark it is Danishes duh, it wasn’t even invented by Danes it was invented by some bakers in Vienna Austria
But they do taste good
I was also thinking Rød Grød med Fløde
I've honestly never tried it nor ever even had the option of trying it
Medister my parents used to make when I was a kid in the 90s, though I never liked it
Seems to have gone a bit out of fashion though
Oh shit yeah, completely slipped my mind
In Denmark you may not fly the Danish flag after sundown, as that would mean you fly it for Satan
High taxes
I have read this comment several times over and still have no idea what you are trying to say
What's the point you are trying to make here
You are talking about a "mentality" and a "stance" without ever mentioning what those are or involve
Wait, the faroese limit is 300DKK
The Danish limit is 80DKK :(
You also have Oostvaardersplassen, which is a really important and interesting area
There was even a movie about it
Only downside with that place is the animal welfare activists
What's surprising is the extreme lack of empathy, or even just viewing women as *people*. You talk to women the same way you talk to men: as people
Within EU there's no limit, but it does make it annoying when ordering bigger things from outside the EU
Most sellers are quite flexible regarding what they write on the invoice though, if you ask nicely
No, it's a globally important case study in ecological restoration
It is also a very important in the Western-European nature, being responsible for the recovery of, among other species, grey goose, white-tailed eagles and spoonbills
Oostvaardersplassen was particularly important in the case of the latter species, since it served as a springboard for them to recolonise much of western Europe
The current Danish population descends from Oostvaardersplassen
Pretty much
Postnord charges 150kr for their toll "service", so you're paying VAT on the value of what you ordered, then VAT for the shipping, then tax on the combined amount if you're ordering something that's worth more than 900-1000kr
And then the service fee on top of that
You can in theory do the toll/tax/VAT thing yourself, but I don't know anybody that does that
At least in Denmark you can do the declaration and payment yourself, provided you're up for filling out a form correctly(looks somewhat challenging), calculate the correct tax and VAT, and then taking it to the SKAT office and paying it there
Then you can show up at your local Postnord place that has your package, and in principle get it from them after showing them the papers
I'm not entirely sure on the process though
Should be cheaper, but more time-consuming
Couldn't you basically collect/send all the parts to someone in Denmark, and then have them ship a combined box to you
I'd say maybe Aalborg or Aarhus
Aarhus less so because towns nearby have so called 'rivalries' with the town and will shittalk it for days if you allow it - while still liking the city and preferring it over, say, Copenhagen or Odense
Aalborg is more harmless but many also describe it as a bit boring
Aarhus has the edge there of being a more exciting place to visit
Nobody really dislikes Fyn (region)
I was also considering the Island of Bornholm
Always in English
At our company we are also a mix of a lot of different nationalities so English is the lingua franca anyways
Good code is not just effecient code, it's also the comments, naming, documentation, etc
i.e. maintainable
But
When you turn up at a customer with 30+ years of legacy code you risk seeing things that is baaaad
I've seen code written in danish, with danish documentation, danish code comments
and with danish variable names including æøå. The customer wanted their new project to adhere to those decades old standards because their company language was danish
That basically ment they could only use danish developers for even the most mundane tasks (and of course they couldn't understand why their outshoring efforts were going so badly)
Always English
Years ago because Æ, Ø and Å in the code used to break something somewhere
Today mostly because there almost always will be someone not speaking Danish involved at some point
Many years ago I worked together with German developers
The product was available in multiple languages
But when it suddenly stopped speaking English to you and error messages in German appeared you knew that you had triggered a severe bug
When they set up shop in Denmark it was a shit feast
Products broke the law with misleading naming and/or imagery - like their strawberry cake without strawberries, and their employee treatment and management methods got the unions to bite their asses *hard*. Then, over the first year or two they got their shit together, and have become one of the better places to work (for supermarkets) and seem to have found their niche with as a discount brand with decent quality and in-house "bake it the last bit of the way" bakeries, that will happily make you eight fresh pretzels if you ask for it
I'll happily shop in a Danish Lidl when I come across one
It used to be a typical German discount store
But now it's really good
Lots of organic products and very cheap
In Denmark its a pretty low discount market, like Aldi or something
Lidl is slightly better than a couple of the other discount supermarkets
it's better than aldi for example
aldi here in Denmark is utter shit
IMO the big problem is that they got so much weird and private-label products
i cant go and find "the thing" i get buy in almost all other supermarkets (there's some exceptions of course) because they mostly got private label stuff and a lot of obscure german brands
meanwhile all other danish supermarkets have a lot of the same stuff, which makes it easy
i can walk into any supermarket, almost regardless of which one it is, and find the same products
i like that
Of course, i dont always buy "name-brand" things but for some things, thats what i do
it doesnt matter with toilet paper or dish soap for me
but it does for cheese, juice, milk and such
and my gf and kid likes certain brands of bread
I much prefer Rema1000 over Lidl, here in Denmark
And then we'll just ignore the bigger stores such as Bilka, Føtex, kvickly or whatever
and Salling Super is completely out of Lidls league
For saaaaan
Lidl does the same thing in Denmark, proudly explaining how most of their goods are actually Danish and not German
Most people say "Hallo" (hello) or "det er/ du taler med Caroline Amalie" (this is/you're speaking with Caroline Amalie)
Maybe I'm in the minority, but I would just say "Hej".
My grandfather used to answer the phone with his full name and jobtitle
I think it's an old person thing
I've also seen old people who answered by saying that addresses
Yeah, I know my grandfather was very sad then they discontinued the practice of having the titel in the phone books
I think it's also because there used to be more importance placed on titles overall
I know my grandfather was tjenestemand, which isn't a thing anymore but used to be quite prestigious, so he would say something like  "tjenestemand (name), (place)", well into his retirement years
He was the son of a widowed washingwife, so i think he was just so proud that he rose so high above his station, that he couldn't help but make it his entire identity
My grandmother was also tjenestemand, but just said her full name when answering the phone
Since she came from a very well-known family, so for her the title was no big deal, whereas her last name was
Unification happened in the 800s, which makes us at least 1100 years old
One king behind the whole thing
Denmark was founded in like 500 AD or something like that
Denmark is generally considered to be founded as a country in the 8th century, but there are signs of a country already from the 6th century
You forgot the Kingdom of Iceland 1918-1944
>Except it has only been a country since 1944
Iceland became a sovereign state in 1918 as the Kingdom of Iceland
The Kingdom of Iceland was independent in the union with the Kingdom of Denmark
That was why Iceland could decide to end the union
Yes, that's true, but Iceland actually had an Icelandic king
It was just the same person as the Danish king
So there were two kings but one person :-)
Fold the rear seats and/or use a trailer for 90% of such needs and rent a van for the rest
Practically every car in this part of Denmark has a tow hook, and every second household has a trailer, so
you use your own trailer, or borrow the neighbor's (or rent one, if you have to
A standard 600 kg trailer will cost ~$15/day, but lots of places will loan you one if you buy heavy or large stuff from them)
We have a horse, that our daughter likes to compete with, so we have a horse trailer that will fit practically everything we could ever need to haul - including junior's belongings when he moved out
We pull the trailer with a bog standard minivan with a 2
0l diesel engine
I know this is a typical comment from a Dane, but here in the cities distances are not a problem, so i load them on my cargo bike and bike with it
The cargo bike can handle bigger items than my compact car
If that still doesn't cut it, then i rent a trailer, for free, to attach to my car
Second this^
Work vans are also used sometimes
Most people who lives in the inner cities don't own trailers
Well a lot of them don't even own cars
There is usually space to park the trailer outside the inner cities
And in Denmark
If you are doing entire remodels in EU you just order the stuff from the hardware store and they deliver it to your door by truck
If your project is large enough delivery is free, for small projects you have to pay
Same as in existing drywall, for new you create a groove to lay it in then plaster over, or add plastic cable lines that you can draw the cable inside
Did you learn to cook in school
I actually don’t know if it’s required by law, but in Denmark, 95% of people I meet had cooking class in school
Normally from around 8-12 years old
Quality varies greatly - I remember one year it was really great, but then the budget was cut
But it was always everyone’s favorite subject, because sometimes you had a cool teacher and made cake
What about your country
Ay, I remember a butcher swinging by with half a pig (including head, tail, feet, ...)
We fed ourselves and all the teachers with the amount of food we made
It was like 30% in my school, but I had it and loved it
It’s actually kinda strange because most Danish schools don’t even have a canteen either, 90% bring lunch from home (and the rest goes out to buy kebab or whatever)
But we still have a kitchen for cooking class
Same here
My cooking book is awesome
Cooking, yeah
From having German in school, we learned about your school system a lot
However, I still don’t really get what hauptschule is
Something between gymnasium and realschule
How popular is each type of school
That’s so weird hearing from a Frenchman
Haha
If there had to be one single requirement, that should be it
I feel like a person who wants citizenship should speak the local language at least relatively fluently
It's okay if they aren't flawless and need to switch to english or something for a little while, but they should be able to get by day to day
It's pretty common in Sweden but it has nothing to do with a English language fetish more that the Swedish language is retarded
I am in the minority here, but I absolutely love the Dutch language
Traag is a great song, btw
No that's our pronunciation of words that's retarded, our language it self is pretty good
We just insist that every little inbred city has it own unique accent nobody really understands
Yea that proofs nothing a language being easy or hard to learn for someone from the Anglo sphere , doesn't make it less or more retarded
Also notice how it's the opinion of one person and the US disagree
Alot of Danes thinks Dutch is ugly
A mixture between of German and English .
Bro you can't say it's ok , you literally copy pasted our language
What's wrong with the number system
His country is why you never turning up drink to a meeting
Come on, man
it's half base 10, half base 20
we all know it's fucked up
Huh, I never thought about that
Your bibles may be safe, but your priests still have those absurd ruffs on like us
I awkwardly mumble hi when I pass them outside my apartment, and then I quickly leave
It varies alot in Denmark
It really depends on the neoghbourhood bit I would say in general neighbours know each other better in the towns and less so in the cities
it varies wildly from person to person
in some places, people in the apartment block are friends with each other
i live in such a place, or at least, partly
i personally am not social with people here but i greet people when i pass by etc
It's pretty common to be on speaking terms with your neighbors in the suburbs and smaller towns/villages
In the suburbs, you're usually not outright friends with them - you just stop to chat for a minute if you both happen to be in your driveways at the same time, and maybe you'll ask them if they can water the plants in your front yard while you're away or something
Actual neighbor friendships are more common in the countryside and small villages
In apartments in larger cities, it's similar to everywhere else in that you don't usually have much to do with your neighbors
You may say hi them if you see them on the stairs and can recognize them, but often not more than that
Of course there can be exceptions to this (I have a friend whose best friends are her neighbors whom she first met after moving into her apartment building), but you shouldn't have an expectation that you'll get to know all of your apartment neighbors personally
In Denmark it is decent (can't speak for the bigger cities, but where I'm from people are kind)
We have this thing called "neighbor help", which is a sign you put at the road so thieves know that even though the owners ER gone, there might still be a neighbor watching
For my own accord
I know my neighbors and what they do
We chat in the driveway if we meet
I imagine where cultural differences would show most Is in suburbs
Compare US suburbs - which often can't even be traversed without cars - to the suburbs I grew up in, where everyone biked and celebrated midsummer together
8min by bike
Across the Copenhagen habour
Pretty nice at the moment as the sun is setting when I bike home a everything is lit in a golden light :)
50 to 60 minutes by bus to University, to work 10 to 15 minutes by cycle
love the bus ride since it's where i listen to podcast or nap
I can either go 25 minutes by bike (preferable when the weather is nice), or 2 minutes walk to a bus stop, which will get me to the nearest metro station (which is 5 minutes away in bus), and then take the metreo for 8-ish minutes to a stop thats 5 minutes away on foot from my job
Copenhagen: I takes 25 minutes
Biking of course
When I'm in the office it's roughly a 45-minute drive on main roads
I spend the time listening to podcasts, audiobooks, and the occasional Spotify
When I'm at clients my drive varies from 30 minutes to several hours
Luckily Denmark isn't that big, so I'm usually back home every evening
5 min walk, 20 min metro, 5 min walk
About 12-15 minutes on bike, mostly through a single central neighborhood in Copenhagen
Pretty boring, but quite safe
It takes about the same if I take the bus along the same route, but it's just short of €2 for a single ticket, so I might as well get some exercise and save the money
Also the biking lane has room for about 3 bikes side-by-side most of the way, so it's easy to either just go with the flow in the inner lane or to speed up if you are in a hurry
Taking my car is out of the question
A single day's parking costs about €15
Icelandic & Faroese names
Just sounds so old-timey and cool
Also it's cool that they keep the old tradition of patro- and matronyms alive that we lost long ago, and only have remnants of
George, Victoria  Richard and François
Are the first that come too mind
Jason sounds badass and masculine imo
I don't think many children move out to live on their own :P
But I think it's pretty typical to move out at 18-19, because the financial assistance given to all adult students and cheap student housing actually allows people to do so
18-22ish
depends on which school, and where the parents live and of course, the economy of both the student and the parents
i moved out just before i turned 19
After high school (most people graduate between 18-20), young people generally start to prepare for it
It's pretty common to take one or two gap years after high school where you work and travel and use your parents' house at a base, but afterwards you're pretty much "expected" to have moved out or at least making concrete plans to do it (not that your parents will throw you out, but other people will think you're odd if you have never tried to live on your own after age 23 or so)
Normally just before University starts
Hence somewhere around 18-20
Personally I was 19
Yeah this sounds right
A friend of mine even moved out at 17
There's a canon pointed at sweden, and there's a old law, that says "If a swede walks on the ice water, you can kill him" This law is still counting, but we have so many other laws that there's no way around it
Could you please send some nice weather then
Of course you have, its just strange that even after all these houndres of years, the canons are still there
The whole talk of a "final form" is prety silly to me
Denmark has changed what areas it controlled several times each century in the last millenium, there is no definite area over long periods
There's an episode of black mirror where the villagers speak Danish
I don't remember which episode number
I was at a wedding yesterday in Timișoara(Western Romania), at the Orthodox Metropolitan cathedral
After it was done, we stood outside for pictures, and there was this huge group of retirees on a guided tour
After a while they started speaking Danish
Definitely a "what the fuck are the odds
"-moment
There's also a terrible Steven Seagal movie I can't remember the name of where the evil terrorists are Danish for some reason
Every Germanic languages that isn't English has Johannes
cupcake cafés. I have never seen one in my entire life
We don't really hate the swedes
We just won't admit they have beaten us once or twice in different things
Dammit, comrade, we have the most cupcake cafes and the best cupcake cafes
Reporting you to the workers tribune if you spread lies from decadent West again
> digitalisation is still regarded as this obscure new thing
Oh god yes
Establishing a business in Denmark literally takes less than two minutes with your national online-ID, and pretty much everything is self-service online
Germans apparently loves to use lots of physical pieces of paper for some reason
Shhyyyyyyyy
What the heck are you doing
That's why it's so awkward when you occasionally spot an actually genuinely aggro banter merchant on reddit (both sides, people), talk about missing the point, it's the online equivalent of going studs first into a tackle during a casual five-a-side in the park
>We don't really hate the swedes
Of course we don't hate the swedes of today
They are in general nice people, even though they need to practice their Danish skills more
We hate Sweden, the violent and arrogant country
It like you google “countries with high (blank)” and I look at, and I’m like damn, Denmark made it in the top 10 sweet
And then I look further up and I see that Sweden and Norway are placed higher and I’m like fuck
>Public health centres for youth provide contraception and STD checks free of charge if you're under \~25
Why doesn't your doctor do this for everybody free of charge
Do you pay for the your GP doctor in Sweden
> The idea that we have "no go zones" is pretty laughable
No-go zones are places where the fire department or the police are afraid to go in a single car, which there are plenty of in Sweden (some in Denmark as well)
> Public nudity and sexual openness
In the 70's nudity was almost compolsury in Swedish film, including nude children and nude adults, even in children's movies
Since then society has gotten more prude and young people today are probably about as prude and insecure about displaying their bodies publicly as in other places
Do people associate Sweden with those things
I thought that was us
After all, child pornography was legal in Denmark for many years
It's a turning point in any gay boy's life when he finds out, that the 'straight guys' are professional pornstars
I visited a German high school last year, and they were still discussing whether to install WiFi
Sorry Norway, everybody kind of likes you, even if you are rebel scum :)
>>We hate Sweden, the violent and arrogant country
Is that a thing where you're from
In my part of Denmark (the one closest to Sweden) it absolutely isn't, Sweden isn't viewed like that
Violent
> I see that Sweden and Norway are placed higher and I’m like fuck
Suck it Sweden and Norway
Denmark No
TBF, you lots have *perfected* the art of shuffling papers between various offices for *flippin' ages*. I've come to believe that any new company in France starts with at least three employees
Two administrative staff to handle the paperwork, and the founder
Just wanna say in all the negativity that this also makes Germany to me less superficial, more approachable, more people friendly and less stuck on appearing modern and with-it compared to what I know from home
It's hard to describe precisely but going to a market in Hamburg has a vibe we lost at some point during the 90s when we decided "folkelighed" (volkstümlichkeit) was no longer cool (at least in the capital region, they're probably less stuck-up in Jutland)
>Copenhagen feels like my second capital because of how close it is to where I live
You are perhaps living in Greater Copenhagen without even knowing it:
Wait what part do you live in
Amager
Sweden has been very violent throughout the history
Suck it Europe
I'm surprised it's not for free to go to your GP in Sweden like in Denmark
>The term "no go zone" is not used by Swedish police or any other emergency services
The term "särskilt utsatt område", Especially vulnerable area, is used
Yes, no go zones are the popular term for vulnerable areas, where emergency services are in high risk of being attacked
I thought that was some kind of city in Sweden and got super offended like, how dare they name a city after our capital and naming it greater
You can have the whalers if you return the north sea oil money ;)
Sure, you’re the little brother of the family
Mildly annoying yet adorable
So have we, and it was several life times ago
It's *really* strange cultivating a hate for that reason in 2019, and you must be extremely angry with Germany, then, considering the occupation was a mere 70 odd years ago
> As a matter of fact I do
That's awesome
Welcome fellow Greater Copenhagener :-)
>I've only ever heard "The Öresund Region" being mentioned in that context
Yeah, it was renamed some years ago
You are making us all Scanian now, you snaphane
We solved the border dispute with Germany in a civil referendum
We still miss to see Sweden granting Skåne, Halland and Blekinge similar referendums
Well, there are some disagreement about that
You wrote earlier:
" *In several areas, including in Stockholm and Göteborg, there are instances when the police need to escort ambulance and firefighters on calls
* "
But of course then you wrote:
" *This is however not based on specific areas, but depends on the kind of incident
* "
These kind of incidents tend to happen in the ghetto areas though, hence the term no go areas
Don’t wait too long
Greenland is so hot right now </fifth element meme>
Ah, you're joking, nice one, had me going
Joking
I would love to see the deputed territories getting referendums
Tradition in the waiting for skijump
No country has fought as many wars as we and the swedes has
&#x200B;
Edit: I just got a brand new axe, yall wanna see another war
In 1520 the Danish King Christian the 2nd had a big chunk of the Swedish nobility killed in what would later be called the [Stockholm Bloodbath]
At least it's funny when you're a Dane
Bluetooth is named after harald Bluetooth and the logo is his initials in the runic alphabet
It was named as such because like how Harald united the danes, Bluetooth unites devices
but only recognized by a few other countries that also claim land on the south pole
True, but at least we're not swedish
I think most politicans vote for themselves
Everyone would be if Sweden was their neighbor
I thought every country used their flag for birthdays
then I imagined how weird a birthday would look like with the german or french flag, because the danish flag is "*the* birthdayflag"
Pølsevogn !
It's sorta like a  hot dog cart you see in new york and such
but larger
like this:
they got hot dogs of course, but also burgers and a few other typical things
I've yet to see these in other countries
i've seen OTHER kinds of food-wagons/trucks but not like this
i know what they are
even featured in danish television
called Krokette in Danish
One of my favourite restaurants in Copenhagen is a galette restaurant
You can only order variations on galettes or crepes
But then again, it's run by a Frenchman, so it's not something that's very common here
Bruh are you for real
Jeg skal ha en død indianer med det hele, tak
I have heard Olsenbanden was quite popular in East Germany, no
[yeah]
forget choosing a theme, it's all flags when it comes to celebrations
christmas, new year's eve, anniversaries, whatever
flags everywhere
[we give students a sailor cap and let them drive around drunk everywhere in decorated military vehicles]
It's weird because most Danes I know think the Americans are overdoing it
We use it for any kind of celebration, but as soon as someone tries to use it in a political or nationalistic sense, it always sparks a huge debate
no, they don't. so strange
In Denmark it is called a bobspil
I did not know, it was a non-English invention :)
us scandinavians see our flags a bit different than many other countries
they represent joy and celebration, as well as symbolising a shared culture, language, and history
[Danes can be a little obsessive]
no, not like the americans
it's hard to describe, but it's definitely different from the americans
first thing being that the danish flag is rarely used for patriotic reasons
like I said: it's hard to describe
you would have to experience it yourself to understand it
Æbleskiver, definitely
There is no better way to celebrate Christmas than to get some æbleskiver from a Christmas market
Koldskål.
According to google, it's translated to "cold buttermilk soup".
Kaj kager, flødeboller, rødgrød med fløde, risalamende, hindbærsnitte, all so delicious and very danish
Gotta be risalamande, it sounds french but I can assure you that it's not
Before I clicked the link, I did not expect to see chocolate cake
I thought it was [klatkager] based on the name lmao
I beg to differ
No Danish dessert can match the glorious homemade [koldskål] with fresh strawberries and kammerjunkere .
Definitely my favourite summer dessert
Seconded
In the summer months I would probably say koldskål is my favourite dessert, whereas I would say æbleskiver or risalamande in the winter months
Can't imagine eating either of them outside their "months".
I remember once someone told me it's proven that Danes really love minimalism and moderation, by the fact that we all only eat our favourite dessert during a specific time of year
Its basically a dairy based milk combination, with or without eggs and lemon, and other types of Danish dairy products
to my knowledge these cant really be translated without losing their meaning completely
besides the recipe changes from family to family
Parfaits are more solid - this is literally just like a liquid/soup
Think of it as a dairy-based sweet soup
Mostly it's made by mixing a little bit of 'soured milk' (tykmælk - it's kinda like yogurt but thinner), a lot of buttermilk, vanilla, lemon, and sugar
Some people use eggs as well, though it's not something I've ever had
And then you can put in berries and stuff if you want to, but traditionally you only use kammerjunker, which is a type of vanilla biscuit
Basically, you should be able to drink it straight from a cup if it weren't for the biscuits
[Well it is a British democracy]
It's hardly on the level of the stuff the Germans, Russians, and Japanese did
You forgot “nisseøl” the very light beer that you drink with “risengrød”
Fun fact
"Julebryg" is just regular beer, but with vodka and Liquorice
Or so i've been told by a teacher i had once, who was in a brewery club
we (my class) also made beer with him
we made some and it really did add that weird "julebryg" taste (I'll add, "Julebryg" just means "Christmas brew")
Tuborg is the company behind our J-Dag here, we call it Tuborg Julebryg, which is Tuborg Christmas Brew when translated
Sounds like you are getting the same thing :)
Here is the original Danish Tuborg Christmas in [can] or [bottle]
Stille nacht is one of my favourite beers
I would imagine they also have the Tuborg Julebryg
Pilsner Urquell on tap is my favorite summer beer :)
in most towns, people here in Denmark have "fjernvarme" - which is basically heat transfered from a heating plant, through water (in pipes)
It's a closed system of sorts
so the plant transfers warm water to your house, which then runs through your radiators and such, and warms your home and your own water supply
You do NOT have access to the water from this system
You can't drink it and so on
it's being monitored for temperatures and such
Anyways, some also use gas, and some use oil or ... wood pellets
basically the closer you are to a town, the more likely you are to use "fjernvarme". almost all of copenhagen for example, use fjernvarme
it's a pretty efficient system
Pretty common here in Denmark
> Nonetheless wood heating is a demanding way to heat your house which is why people prefer other methods
Heating with oil has been one of the most common but other methods like air pumps, air to water pumps and geothermal heating are getting more and more common
My parents changed their oil pan to the air to water pump and they also have a fireplace to give excess heat when it's cold enough
> That is probably the most common way to use wood heating, as an excess heating method
Basically the same situation in Denmark outside the areas with district heating coverage
For actual heating purposes
I agree most homes have a fireplace for "hygge" in the cold seasons, but in my experience almost no people actually use it to heat their house and instead use other sources
Yes, it's pretty common where there is no district heating
Most houses will have another source of heating at the same time though
So for instance it is also to have a combination of a heat exchanger and a wood stove
In farms it's also common to have straw-burners (to feed the central heating system)
Some also do have wood/pellet burners to feed their central heating system
But they require a lot of work, so they aren't common
Depends on who lives there, our heating is mostly not used, since it isn't very useful
We only use it to heat up clothing, but it doesn't get used for much else, so we do use the fireplace for heating, since it has worked since we moved into this house
The only really good heating is in my room, which I don't use, since it's already very hot inside, with windows in my room open from the morning to afternoon
Temperature does not change
My dad heats his house in the winter with a fireplace
I think it's both for "hygge" for him, as well as the fact that he has a big and old house and turning on the fireplace is quicker and cheaper for heating, than going around turning on all the radiators so the cold from the other room don't spread to the areas he's in
When we learned about the Kalmar union and the Denmark-Norway union after that, we mainly focused on the good thing whereas the Swedish and the Norwegians tend to view it differently
The good things were that an united Scandinavia enabled Scandinavia (and thus Denmark) to stand up against bad forces from Europe such as the Hanseatic league
And the unification by a woman (Queen Margrethe I) was a major achievement
As unions they were not described as a Danish empire as such, but it was only much later, I discovered that Norway and Sweden actually were not part of Denmark but still three countries (Norway and Sweden being independent on paper)
The crusade and destruction of the Wends was described as self defence/revenge and the conquering of Estonia as a righteous and Christian crusade
Greenland and the Faroe Islands are what is left from the good old empire times and we should take good care of them
Actually, the real mistake was retreating from Russia in the winter
It was a rival to the Danish king and the interests of the crown
The Baltic Sea trade was very profitable and the league became also a political factor and thus a threat to the crown
There were numerous wars and fighting
In a way the Kalmar union ended because of this, as the Swedish were more interested in trading with the league than fighting it
Edit:
The hanseatic league tried to monopolize the trade in the Baltic Sea by blockading other cities or attacking them
They were somewhat of a menace and can be compared to the Trade Federation in Star Wars
Tokyo, Kawaguchi, Matsumoto, Kanazawa, Kyoto, Osaka, Hiroshima, Nagasaka, Nara
Isn't there a "Toyota" city
also kyoto, tokya, okinawa, fokushima and ... ehm
thats all i remember off the top of my head
I was very naive thinking everybody at least know Nagasaki and Hiroshima
Tokyo
Hiroshima
Nagasaki
.. sorry
For Denmark, the only one I can really think of is Lars Mikkelsen, the brother of Mads Mikkelsen
He’s narrated some big documentaries in recent years
We also have people like Søren Ryge and Jørgen Skovgaard, but they’re more niche
I don't know his name but he has voiced the docu series "Vilde vidunderlige Danmark" most of his stuff seems to be wildlife centered
Ah yes, I was thinking we didn't have one but  I'd forgotten Lars and how big Historien Om Danmark was, for example
I owe a 12-tal to that guy - I watched the entire series preparing for my oral exam in Danish history during my bachelor's.
I wouldn't say Søren Ryge is niche though - but that might be because of my age
> Vilde vidunderlige Danmark
Lars Mikkelsen, the brother of Mads
He is everywehre in documentaries right now, he made DR's Danish History one a few years ago, and also the Reunion with Sønderjylland one this year
Oh that's him
The name is so generic, that's why I forgot
Rasmus Paludan
Extreme right winger, open racist, and attorney
His slogan is something like "The guardian of the community, soldier of freedom, light of the Danes"
He is a huge Islam hater, burned the Koran on a one time use grill, said that every immigrant should be thrown out of the country, despite his wife being from Thailand
Almost seemed like a huge media stunt, even though it wasn't.
I would say Rasmus Paludan, but he barely counts as a politician
He only ran for prime minister once, and lost miserably
His policies included (and were pretty much limited to):
Banning islam in Denmark
Deporting every muslim from Denmark
When asked about his climate policy, he blamed the muslims
When his policies were compared to nazism (which is a fair comparison if you ask me), he just turned it around, and called the interviewer a nazi for asking such a question
The guy is irrelevant now, so thankfully none of his nonsense was ever considered
Just give us Skåne back and you won't have to worry about it
You're welcome
You probably won’t even be able to tell the difference, with the normal stench coming from Malmø.
> This guy keeps the whole government in check and nothing happens without his consent and he is not even the Prime Minister or President
How exactly does this work
Why do they care what he thinks
And yet people keep voting for his party
Luckily though, he is not a politician
I guess it depends on how you look at it
I'd rather take 1
8% of the votes for Paludan, than just under 50% for donald trump
I feel like it shows that the vast majority of people don't vote for the loudest stupidest guy they can find
He is a politician, yes
You don't have to be in the parliament to be a politician
I believe you just have to get mandates at "regionsvalget" as the bare minimum to be qualified as a politician, or you have to be part of a political group, who got a mandate
He got both personal votes, and so did Stram Kurs
So he's a politician
I shall tell my grandchildren of my brave service in the Shit Wars
It's just called "toast" here, and we put slices of ham in there too, usually
They're typically made in a panini press or something similar, though you can make them in a pan too
We’ve got the croque monsieur that everyone else has (we call them “parisertoast”), but we also have a version that I think is unique to Denmark called a “cowboytoast”, which is with ground beef
We were the first country to legalize porn
You're welcome
Do you know how if other EU countries pays to use the autobahn
Or is that just Austria
That's how we like it
Yeah the EU sucks for a lot of those reasons
You can come to Denmark from a EU country and work very little and suddenly become eligible for a lot of welfare, because of the same reasons, for example
Highways are also free for everyone in Denmark despite being a transport corridor between Europe and the North
You need to work 225 hours a year, but apart from that, the rules are the same
She must have had some savings or other stuff that made her ineligible
Citizenship and immigration is another deal
The Swedes have worse welfare than us, so we stay home, lol
Corfitz Ulfeldt married the kings daughter, got in a fight with the new king, his brother in law, defected to Sweden and helped them during the disastrous 1658 war that led to a loss of Scania
He is probably the biggest one, especially since he sold out to Sweden of all places
Britta Nielsen
She pretty much scammed Denmark for 111 million crowns and then rushed to south africa
Some woman named Britta Nielsen, found a loophole in our entire banking system, and managed to steal 111 million DKK
And if I remember correctly, she at first tried to play the pity card, then tried to play the "I was just showing you what was wrong
" card
Bitch
Rasmus Paludan's entire "campaign" (no other words are in my mind for it, other Danes might correct me, please do
I don't know the biggest scandal anymore, since there's always this and that as a "scandal" so I have no idea whats biggest currently
Var det ikke hende, der bare nappede lidt efter lidt, indtil at hun blev opdaget
Rasmus Paludan havde skandale skrevet på ham
Han lyder også til at passe som en
That we actually let people from Sweden work in Copenhagen
Naaaah
Jk aside
We're a very small country
Nothing is really shocking, because you meet people from different cultural areas every day
None, really
Too small and homogenous
Because Copenhagen is Sweden
Do i have to remind you how a [map of Denmark] looks like
Forsvarsministeriet which means "The Ministry of Defence".
Before 1950, Denmark had a "Ministry of War", but it was combined with the "Ministry of the Navy" to make the "Ministry of Defence"
In Denmark it's basically "The Defense" or Forsvaret
I don’t drink alcohol or milk
As a dane i dont like "rugbrød" (rye bread)
i dont drink
Beer tastes like shit imo
What do you have for lunch then
Nej tak, vi vil ikke have den slags typer
Oh no
"American conditions" is a political scare phrase used to describe a hypothetical situation where the liberals have gotten too much power and privatised and deregulated everything
“A town in Russia” refers to something unknown or strange
Like: My friend smells really bad, to him soap is a town in Russia
A “flying Dutch” is a football term used to describe when you leap forward to head the ball
"Svenskerfuld" = Drunk as a Swede = Very, very drunk
That's a city in Russia
Meaning it's farfetched or meaning the same as 'it's greek to me'
Alright, that's pretty funny
In Denmark we say “Du glade kineser” it means “You happy Chinese” and has the same meaning as yours, it isn’t used much anymore either
Never heard that, but I have heard "Du store kineser"
Strange might depend on where in Denmark you live I guess because I’ve never heard “du store kineser”
Probably, but I'm guessing it's not common at all
No I’ve only heard seniors use it
I don't know if it's exactly a *stigma*, but from what I gather, calling people in positions of authority by their first name and not their title would be a huge social faux pas in other countries . It's the norm here
In Denmark, the age for when someone is considered an adult in sexual relations is 15
Yup
Completely commonplace
[Here's a BBC story about it] (text, not video)
This could lead back to “janteloven”, here it’s almost considered rude to call someone out by last name, bc it would almost certainly be to make fun of someone
Usually we like to treat everyone with a certain amount of respect and we prob don’t think that authority should be treated (very) differently than our selves
In Denmark you're basically informed of when whaling season starts on the faioe islands, by the inslught of anti-denmark articles abroad
Once in a while, people will realise that whaling happens in the Faroe Islands and seal hunting happens in Greenland
People opposed to this will inundate /r/denmark with angry letters, petitions to the PM to stop it, angry rants against the government saying we must put pressure on them to stop it, calling us murderers, etc
The Danish government has nothing to do with what is hunted in the Faroe Islands or Greenland, but since they're part of the kingdom, they must be ours to tell what to do, right
Most people prefer making their own babies rather than stealing others afaik
Not really
Parents usually put a baby monitor in the pram in case they cry
Those students sound a little entitled, I'd say
"When in Rome
", etc
Getting made fun of sounds pretty harsh, but I can completely imagine the bus driver's face
Formal titles are just really, really not done, here
We call them all by their first name
I take it you mean if we use the informal pronouns
If so, then yes and no
We've done away with the formal pronouns, so there is only one way to address others
Yeah, I definitely think it has to do with treating everyone the same and not having anyone stand out or think they're better than everyone else for a particular reason
Affording the same amount of respect to the person who cleans the toilets as to the person who owns the company
As it should be, imo
Yeah, I've only encountered people being addressed by their last names when they are either being made fun of for being up their own arse or something like that, or when its used as a nickname
For example if there's several people in one friend group with the same name
If you called your boss Sir or Ma'am, here, they'd most certainly think you were taking the piss
I don't even think we use Mr/Mrs Lastname that much
The usual phrasing for someone you don't know is their full name, e.g. the PM would be "Mette Frederiksen" and not "Ms Frederiksen". Or you'd just say, "the Prime Minister".
Horse meat is some damn good meat
Just a shame you can't find it here
Oh la di da, you call the prime minister with informal addressing
You must be fancy /s
&#x200B;
The joke being that even in Denmark we don't do that
My cousin is a university lecturer and he says that entitled students are the bane of his existence
He gets requests for extensions, exemptions, and leniency all the time from kids who think they're special and don't have to follow the same rules as everyone else
I wonder if it's a Danish thing, or a generational thing
Ah, okay, good that it wasn't mean-spirited
If you want to get someone's attention and you don't know their name, you just say, "Undskyld" (sorry/excuse me) or "Hallo
" (hullo/hey)
If you said, "Undskyld, hr
/frue/frøken" (excuse me Sir/Ma'am/Miss), people would think you were a confused time-traveller from the 1950s or just a weirdo
Nice to see "How *dare* you
Where I'm from, this is perfectly legal
" is spreading
How embarrassing
Yeah, a simple "Tak" with no titles is as polite as it gets
The clever short ones find one of the countless bicycles in the canal, and stand on that
Historien om Danmark with Lars Mikkelsen (great actor, known internationally from things like Sherlock, The Killing, The Witcher and Star Wars Rebels
Oh and his brother Mads Mikkelsen, let's be honest
Its in danish, but when it came out, a guy in reddit translated the subtitles into English
I believe they are still available
Not available outside of Denmark but "Historien om Danmark" made by Denmark's Radio (DR) is a beautifully made show on Danish history divided into 10 episodes starting with stone age and ending with cold war/welfare society
Very comprehensive overview of the biggest events which helped shape the country
What’s the most random tradition or aspect of your country
What makes you think “why the fuck do we do that”?
Thought about this today when we danced [Les Lanciers] in my school
I thought for the longest time that this was just the most generic, standard partner dance people learned across countries, but I just found out it’s only a thing in Denmark
Les Lanciers is apparently some old French dance that was popular in the 1800’s, but is now only danced at one high school party per year by Danish teenagers because they’re forced to by their teachers
I have no idea why and it’s not like Denmark is a particularly dance-focused culture (almost the opposite, no one “can dance” and people aren’t expected to)
Is there a random tradition or quirk like that from your country
Edit: I forgot, we also fight each other with shaving foam when we graduate 9th grade (around 15-16 years old)
Thx for reminding me of lancier OP, God I hated that with a fiery passion
Aside from that, the studenterhue tradition is also pretty strange
I mean
in Denmark we also burn dolls (supposed to look like witches) on a bun fire to celebrate the days are getting longer
Oi looky here mate
I’m keeping this English for the sake of the subreddit, but don’t you go insulting Lanciers on my watch
I will fight you over this 1800’s French dance, and defend it to the last
In Denmark it is tradition to give people pebber if they are still unmarried when they reach 30
This is a little weird but nothing major
Jutland (part of Denmark) took one look at this tradition and thought "hey let's do something stupid and crazy", and what they came up with, was tying people to a street lamp when they turn 25 and covering them in cinnamon powder
[Here it is happening to a Danish youtuber]
How does this work in big cities like Vienna
Excuse me what
Fifteen looks really good
*Books one-way flight to Turkey*
We burn a witch doll on a bonfire on Midsummer
There’s a bit more history behind that though that actually makes sense
You guys have so much fun at birthdays
We’re just like “if it rains on your birthday it means you’ve been a horrible person”.
I just googled it -it looks kinda creepy lol
How do you pass it around
From friend to friend or neighbor to neighbor
This sounds so great
I love this so much
Wait
The skinny guy is actually called cannabis
We do that too
Interesting to know
What do you call it
Is it the same
True, but it makes a bit more sense
Like making noise and partying in a vehicle when to celebrate that you’ve graduated is pretty expected - minus the vehicle, but party buses exist in multiple countries
Lanciers (which I actually kinda like) is just like
why tho
We have something similar, with challenges and open truck and all, but we don’t have the “gang/team” aspect
It’s just your class
We do something very similar and so does Sweden
Hey we do that too
Every new years eve just before midnight
You have to drink every time he trips over the skin on the floor
Outside of the occasional “pagan” or “Wicca” hippie, no
Not like the witch culture that still thrives in Romania for example
I love this
In Denmark we have the insane partying associated with it
Okay, to be perfectly honest, this was just something I saw in a [Vice Documentary]
Joining the 30 years war
Our minister got so drunk at a lunch with the Norwegians that he gave up many of the oil fields in the north sea and signed a permanent contract on it
Denmark
Maybe not THE dumbest, but choosing wich country should get wich part og the northern sea didn't go in our favour
Norway got way to much of the oil
Legend has it that our king was drunk while doing it
Look, it was pretty stupid of us to get into a war with Prussia in the first place
It would have been equally stupid for Sweden to go down that route with us
San Marinos plates are beautiful with the blue and the crest
[San Marino Plates]
But to be a little biased I think the Danish ones are beautiful in the simplistic way, with big bold letters and numbers
[Danish Plates]
Denmark without a doubt
Who doesn't like black letters on a plain white piece of metal
How does it show that they don’t like the EU
Does the EU-flag on our plates represent that we don’t like Iceland
In Denmark it's like 1100€
They're actually cheaper than they used to be
The government is unapologetically treating the plates as a cash cow, raising and lowering the prices every few years to maximise profit
Also fun fact you have to renew them every 8 years paying 90% of the original cost every time
Also calling robbery is a bit much
A large part of why they can do it so unapologetically is that they're an indulgence, no one is forcing you to buy them and no one actually has a need for them (not to mention no one really benefits from them)
They're a complete superfluity
Idk, at least in my social circles it's generally only viewed as wasteful, not sure if many people consider it flexing to have custom plates
Sure, some people with too much money and no good ideas on how to spend it, might get a set of custom plates
Where I live, I rarely see them and if so, it is used by companies as a sort of advertising (like driving instructors for instance
Outside of Copenhagen and Aarhus I would say Aalborg, but it still doesn't have the city vibe but more a big town vibe
Other than that I would say Vejle or another town in the triangle-area
Danish equivalent of the tristate area in the US, but just with towns of Vejle, Kolding and Fredericia
Copenhagen always sees a lot of development
Except for Copenhagen I would say Herning, Silkeborg, Aarhus and Odense
What about Odense
In 2012, after finishing the new ring road and a bridge across the fjord, they closed down the main road through the center of the city and started to build a new city center on it
The new city centre opens this year
[Official website of the project]
Also the new tram system is to open this year as well
I intentionally left out Odense because it seemed like it has been under construction since forever
It has, but to me, that is recent development
The scale of the reconstruction and development makes me believe it is the city in Denmark which has seen the most development recently
A useful Wikipedia
The Danish one is tiny - even the Norwegian and Finnish Wikipedias are much bigger - and has amateurish articles everywhere
And smooth snakes

Ingredienserne til en kradser kan variere, men som basis gælder at der anvendes et pølsebrød. På pølsebrødet tilføjes forskelligt tilbehør som findes i pølsevognen, og i forvejen anvendes til andre retter
Typisk kan kunden frit vælge imellem hele udvalget uden at der ændres på prisen
Ingredienserne kan være:
Ketchup
Sennep
Ristede løg
Rå løg
Fransk sennep
Remoulade
Syltede agurker
Fransk hotdog dressing
Chili-dressing
Ved valg af få ingredienser, fx ketchup, sennep og ristede løg, vil de blive anbragt på pølsebrødets underside, da den er mere plan end oversiden, og tilbehøret glider så ikke af
Ved valg af flere ingredienser vil det opskårede pølsebrød blive åbnet, og ingredienserne lægges i åbningen, så de ikke glider af, når hele sortimentet bruges
Pølsebrød er opskåret så de kan bruges til at lægge en pølse i, hvilket gælder for en hotdog
Ernæringsmæssigt er det ikke en specielt fiberholdig ret, men er dog den eneste ret i en pølsevogn der henvender sig til vegetarer
Prismæssigt er en kradser billigere end fx en hotdog
I år 2007 svinger priserne på landsplan fra kr
5,- til 9,-. Specielt prisen er også årsagen til kradserens popularitet
Efterspørgslen på kradsere er faldet i nyere tid, og det er derfor sjældent man ser kradseren nævnt på menukortet i pølsevognen
Mange pølsevogne sælger dog gerne kradsere hvis man spørger, men man skal være forberedt på at blive afvist
Oh don't worry, we're right up there along side with you
It's so baffling how everyone is miserably in the summer because of our incredibly well insulated houses but air conditioning is still frowned upon
would switch Danish for German cuisine at an instant
this is literally the first time I have ever seen a Ƶ
I write  Ƶ  in lower case, but it comes from working with math
I just think that most danes just don't write z.
Same here for both Z, W and Q
Same here
Also Norwegianizing loan words
Like writing sjalu instead of jaloux
I think most people do have a middle name
I don’t have a middle name and I like to think I’m a bit unique in that regard
Yes, it's very common - I'd guess more than half of the population has a middle name
My middle name is my dad's last name, and my last name is my mom's last name (my mom kept her last name when they married), and getting a last name from both of your parents is probably the most typical kind of middle name, but having a first name as a middle name is also very common
You guys do tend to have 5-7 names
It’s always interesting to see how many names a new Portuguese colleague of mine has, but indeed seem to rarely use them, outside your first and last names
I love my second name
I hate my last name
i dont know if this is just a thing for movies and tv shows
but not taking your shoes off when you get home
You've got sand, maybe mud, water, dirt etc, in your shoes and you just carry it around in your home
that's just disgusting
I don't really get why you prefer trucks over vans
Does it not rain on your stuff
Wearing shoes inside
Keeping their shoes on while inside homes
Their portion sizes
Gi-fucking-gantic
I mean, I dont complain, it's nice to bring the leftovers home for a midnight snack, but that concept was so foreign to me
Yea it's so weird
Usually the only stickers you will find on cars in Denmark is [this] It says "support our soldiers".
>Those churches where you sing
This is something that weirds me out, when I was in church last time in Romania
Why is it only those 6-9 people who get to sing
but I do that
it is so much more efficient to cut up all the food first to make it ready for the fork, although I do use the knife to get all the sauce on the fork as wel,
I guess we kinda relate to them in a way to be honest
Though theirs may be a bit more in-your-face-ish
In Denmark, 0% of kids die in school shootings
The closest we got was in 1994 on Aarhus University, where a guy killed 2 other students
I always take off my shoes, also in the Netherlands - is it not normal here
That's a dangerous question
This is a Greek Catholic church, so it's a fun mix between the two, no obscene amounts of gold like in the Orthodox churches(I've been in a few for weddings), but no comprehensible singing either
[In Danish Lutheran churches, it usually goes a lot like this] mind the piss-ugly modern church though, couldn't find good footage from a more traditional one), where everyone has a book of hymns
well both hands are on utensils, regardless of which I use
You don't know me
Stop caring
Copenhagen
There has been an explosion in construction along the harbour front and in an old military site which is now full of archictecture seen in the link
[Fjordenhus] in Vejle, Denmark by Olafur Eliasson
Yes, there are some old castle vibes there
It even has a drawbridge of sorts
It's even more impressive up close because of the insanely detailed masonry and general art-approach to the entire building
Nothing is random, everything is part of the design
Why-ever would you put that in quotes
If anything, you're country is an excellent example of the kind of issues a European federation might meet on a continental scale
Danes and Finns are very alike to each other, quite similar to Germans and Brits, relatively similar to northern French and perhaps northern Italians, and only vaguely similar to the Balkans or southernmost Europe
Even current states, like Spain and Britain, have issues with secessionists, despite Scots and English or Catalans and Castilians being *much* more similar than Norwegians and Serbians
I think a lot of progressives, particularly federalist progressives, have this notion that we all ought to get along, that the differences between our nations are really inconsequential
Well, maybe a well-off, city-dwelling federalist from Finland is quite similar to a well-off, city-dwelling federalist from Portugal, but neither are representative of their nations' average people
> I don't think political integration have to mean cultural integration too
Political integration *always* means cultural integration
To say otherwise is to speak of unevidenced hypotheticals
Compare Russia today to the region 300 years ago, or France, or Spain, or the US, China, or literally any other country
The only large states that don't have overwhelming tendencies towards single languages dominating are either recent or not very cohesive and fraught with infighting
Different people have different ideologies and philosophies of life (and therefore, governance)
The government can't appeal to everyone at once, and so as long as cultural differences exist, the government will clash with local peoples
This always leads to either the locals being forced to assimilate (see: Wales, Turkey, France, the US, China), or the situation devolving into civil war and secessionist movements (see: Yugoslavia, Spain, Denmark, Ireland)
I listed those as two outcomes, but even then, most of those countries were really examples of both
Yearh danish rail is so shitty they outsource parts to DB for more efficiency
> Finns are similar to Danes, who are similar to Germans, who are similar to Austrians, who are similar to Slovenians, who are similar to Croatians, who are similar to Serbians etc
I know, but that was precisely my point, with the addition that it doesn't come around
Danes are similar to Norwegians, and Serbians are similar to Bulgarians, but Bulgarians aren't similar to Norwegians
They are *more* similar to Norwegians than to Thai, that is true, but also irrelevant
The point is that while you could probably lump Danes and Norwegians together without problems (although saying that, read up on Dano-Norwegian history), but the same doesn't go for Danes and Serbians
Hell, even Serbians and Croats didn't work out, and they are about as similar as you can get
> My country is a separate case its not based on differences but deeper political reasons and prior propaganda it has nothing to do with the subject
Ah, so the fact that Greeks and Turks differ on rather essential points is unimportant, yes
And all the issues with Greeks in Turkey and Turks in Greece during the 20th century were *purely* political
Well, they certainly were political, but where did those politics come from
They came from locals desiring independence from a regime that didn't represent them
> How do you think the roman empire came into being
Through conquest and cultural imperialism
>  the "differences" you listed are differences that arise after we are born they are taught differences
Yes, that would be what we tend to call *culture*. Me being a Dane is genetic on the ethnic level, but in terms of culture, that is something I have learnt, yes
It's the customs, norms, traditions and values that have been handed down to me from my family and my kinsfolk
Yet to you, what most would call *culture* is "differences" in parenthesis
That's not surprising - that's how most federalists think
That's also why a united EU is never going to happen
> no one is saying lets instantly create this EU state, but lets just take a step towards that
"No one is saying let's instantly create the Roman Empire, but let's just take a step towards that
So, using your own example of Rome, how do you think the above would have sounded to a Gaul
It proves that even minute differences mean the world
You cannot seriously be deluded enough to think that ethnic/cultural/religious differences don't matter
> If you looked as of right now to the cultures of those countries you will notice that there are many many similarities both genetic and cultural, although the latter is more common
Quite to the contrary
The genetics are more similar, while the cultures differ more
Ionian Turks would have considered themselves Greeks less than a millennium ago
Yet to say that Turks and Greeks are culturally similar is a vague statement at best
They share many commonalities, sure, deriving in part from common history, in part from common circumstance and environment
Yet clearly, the differences are substantial - the issue of religion not least of them
To deny that is to deny literally a thousand years of war, not to mention the current geopolitical tension
> Because they were opressed as Christians under the Ottomans not opressed by the others that lived amongside them
But the Ottomans *were* the Turks
The elite, yes, but to claim that they were completely unrepresentative of common sentiment is just plain wrong
Of course Turks and Greeks could and do coexist, but the fact of the matter is that the history of the two peoples is one of constant strife and one oppressing the other
Whether Greeks coexisted with neighbouring Turks is not the point - the point is that Greeks did not wish to be *ruled* by Turks, and that they were not satisfied until they reclaimed their own state
That has always been the situation, and is still the situation - people don't want to be ruled by foreigners, particularly not ones that are culturally different/opposed
> Would an European federaion opress people
Yes, it would
If it didn't, it would never succeed
Even a single nation like France could not have existed in its current form if not for the ruthless oppression of local populations (Occitanians, Bretons, Basques, etc)
On the flip-side, if you aren't quite so ruthless and allow the locals more cultural independence, you get a situation like Spain
And even then, Spanish is rapidly supplanting most of the local languages, even with their relative degree of autonomy
Most Catalonians don't speak Catalan
> I gave that example because Roman empire was an example of a great multiethnic empire
A multi-ethnic empire born through conquest, which resulted in the extinction of nearly every other language in Mediterranean Europe save Latin
Rome is why Celtic is restricted to a few scattered remnants in the Atlantic
Rome is why Etruscan doesn't exist anymore, why Roman is the only remaining Italic language
Rome was a great empire and should be celebrated, but in the analogy you are setting up, my nation aren't the Romans - we are the Gauls
> Even USA is multiethnic
Racially, sure
Culturally, it's a monoculture to an insane degree
The amount of cultural uniformity in the US is almost unbelievable, considering how massive an area it is
And again, in that comparison, we're not the Americans, we're the Indians
> Turkey is multiethnic to actually but you know why the country does not have intercommunal issues
Because ethnic minorities tend not to trouble you when you've deported or genocided them all
> by living in the same environment you learn about others and they don't seem so alien to you after a while and you just notice that they are human too with almost identical behaviors
Yes, but what's the end-goal here
A US-like situation where Europe is almost entirely culturally homogeneous
That could work, sure - the US proves as much
But what would be that dominant culture
What would we all speak
How would we all act
Whose values would we all follow
I don't want to be "European", I want to be, and am, Danish, and I will fight to protect my country and culture from any pseudo-imperialistic notions of a hegemonic "European-ness"
> No, it proves that propaganda is what means the world
This has nothing to do with propaganda
We are talking about a pattern literally as old as history
The fact that different peoples feud with each other, or more precisely, that different people wish *seperation* from each other, is attested in more or less every instance of history
Different people may coexist peacefully, as long as both are allowed to practice their differences
Once one gains power over the other, however, there is an inevitable conflict
Let's say there are two peoples, A and B. They differ on core conceptions of ethics and religion, and practice different ways of life
Initially, both posses their own territories bordering each other, and are engaged in peaceful trade
If people A begin ruling people B, A cannot impose their values and rules upon B without conflicting with people B's own culture
Yet if they do not impose their own norms and regulations, people B will be impossible to govern, since they don't ascribe to their rulers' ideas of governance and values
Therefore, and again, inevitably, conflict will arise, and B will seek independence from A. The only possible outcomes from this are 1
Independence for people B, 2
assimilation of people B into A, or 3
a constant state of ethnic tension and conflict
This is why, as regards peace-making, the singularly most effective piece of construction is not, and has never been, the bridge
It has always been the wall
There are already some Danish Disney princesses from The little Mermaid and Frozen
Both based on fairytales by Hans Christian Andersen
[like this]
The Little Mermaid which is a HC Andersen fairytale
The Frozen sisters are Norwegian but could also be Danish, at least by looks, with a squirrel or a horse instead of a snowman and reindeer
Edit: Saw another alresdy posted exactly this
Wasn't the southern isles supposed to be Denmark in Frozen(aka, where Hans comes from)
And besides we already have our beautiful Princess
His name is Holger Danske ;)
The same artist actually did the [Finnish Maiden ] as well
I can't say
It's only loosely based on the Snow Queen
The scenery is ~~mostly~~ Austrian and ~~a bit~~ Norwegian
Frozen is based on a Danish fairytale, the Snow Queen, by HC Andersen
Yes, the scenery in the cartoon is from Norway and Austria
And slightly aroused
I think most people think of Hallstatt, Austria
Not directly, but it is mentioned
We mostly learned and heard about what happened during our occupation
Nothing much otherwise
Only basic stuff
In geography we don't really learn about all the different countries, cities, and rivers
These are the things i can remember learnig: plate tectonics, different proffesion types, climate, weather and exports and poduction around the world
What’s the most impressive piece of architecture in your country
honestly, i dont really know
but a lot of stuff outside of Denmark are drawn by danish designers/arcitects
like the opera house in sidney, or the "La Grande Arche de La Defense" in france
[Storebæltsbroen]
Fun fact, you can actually see this thing from [Stevns Klint] through some binoculars they have there
Here's a [picture] I took of it
According to Google maps it's around 50km

Over here in Denmark, I’d say the most hated people in any job position are the train “controllers”.
Basically ticket guards, they roam all the methods of public transport and verify whether or not you have a ticket for your mode of transportation(or something of equal function like a travel-card)
If you don’t have a train ticket or anything like that, they’ll write you bill of about 100€. For this reason alone people hate them as any morning commute can turn into a financial nightmare
They are also known for being extremely petty about their apparent “authority” and will try to do short of everything to make your day worse
I remember a few times when Danish Zoos would have to kill an animal for some reason and would do it publicly
Once, I think it was Odense Zoo who killed a giraffe publicly, which is completely normal practice, foreign media really blew it out of proportions
Why not teach kids some biology while we're at it
Edit: the specific case of the giraffe apparently was Copenhagen zoo
Also, it was the act of dissecting the animals that caused foreign outrage
When the Syrian refugees were walking through Europe, a lot of focus was on the Danish "jewelry law" regarding when refugees apply for asylum
From my understanding, the law says that when you apply for asylum in Denmark, if you carry jewelry of high value with little sentimental value they can be confiscated to help pay for your asylum
This was then reported as us stealing all the jewelry of the refugees
From what I have been told, it has only been used once and we are not even the only country with that law
Supposedly Germany has it also (feel free to correct me on that), but all the focus was on us
In 2015 international news blew up a story about my local zoo dissecting an already dead lion, in front of an audience
The zoo thought it would be a good idea to show the anatomy of the animal, so the public might learn something
The international media disagreed, and a lot of international news outlets showed up to something that essentially wasn’t news
It was Copenhagen Zoo
[Here] is the chief of the zoo very calmly and patiently explaining to an ass of a news presenter why killing a giraffe and having kids watch the autopsy/butchering of it was not a bad thing
Huge kudos to Bengt Holst for keeping his cool, even though you can clearly see he is so over the Channel 4 guy and his extremely leading questions
I'm not sure if it was euthanised publicly, but it was dissected in front of the public for educational means
Just recently a dead whale was dissected and the British and American media again threw a fit
Jesus, how hard is it to say, "Sorry, I don't understand what you're saying
You're right it was the public dissection that made them go bananas
i've got no idea what is stereotypical for danish people to do
Two days ago i had a whole lunch involving either pork or canned fish on ryebread at 11:20 in the morning
Later I had dinner at 17:30
Also, saw a 'fiend' at a cross and went the other way to avoid small talk
It was a good day
That genuinely makes me happy
sometimes I don't even know what I am saying myself
"You just ordered thousand liter milk"
To be fair, drunk Danish teens in Prague are the worst
And the drunkest
So I don't blame you

Interesting
Denmark started allowing dual citizenship in 2015, and I think most people are ambivalent to the change
Personally, I think dual citizenship is alright so long as strict and rigorous requirements for naturalisation are maintained
You want citizens to have a strong connection to the country, and not simply become citizens for convenience or welfare
How does it work with a Spanish citizen wishing an additional citizenship
Is that problem free
Within the EU you can live and work in the other EU countries
In Denmark you qualify for social services once you're a citizen, so I think it's fair if we required the Danish citizenship to be the only one you have
Are you referring to the 2014 russian annexations
My cousin is half Italian half Danish, and I remember he turned 18 before 2013 and had to 'pick a citizenship' (if you are below 18 you were able to hold dual), and he picked Danish, even though he grew up in Italy, since it would help him both education- and jobwise
Then they changed it in 2015 and he was so gutted
Luckily Italy is quite open about having people with heritage get their citizenship, so he got it back basically straight away but honestly, I just remember us all thinking it was so stupid he even had to pick
If Spain won't let you have duel citizenship and you think your true identity is Romanian, then why don't you live in Romania
Then why could you want to keep the citizenship
If Spain is better, you have more friends there, and you've spent most of your life in Spain, why would you prefer the Romanian citizenship over the Spanish one
Mine is french
And Swedish is my least favorite
Russian honestly
German
Rude
They are, very
When a Dane and a Norwegian (or Swede) speaks they’ll both continue to speak in their native language
Typically goes like this:
Anyone can read each other’s language easily
Norwegians understand Swedish with ease and Danish with a little less ease
Will have trouble actually speaking Danish especially
Swedes understand Norwegian but often have trouble with Danish
Danes understand Norwegians easily and Swedes a little less easily
France: The “they surrendered in 5 seconds lol”-jokes are getting old, and it’s incredibly disrespectful
Sweden: “rape capital of the world” is a phrase I wish would die out
Iceland: sure not a lot of people live there, but it’s not an insignificant country, they have a lot of culture, nature and excellent cuisine (and people are really nice)
All of Scandinavia/Nothern Europe: Calling Nothern European people “a bunch of commies” is incredibly dumb imo
Sweden and Norway
If anyone is gonna bully those drunken pieces of shit, it's gonna be us
Do not ridicule Sweden or Norway
Only we can ridicule them
Technically not a country "beside my own", being a part of my own, but I dislike it when people mock Greenland and Greenlanders because of their problems with alcoholism and high suicide rates
It's especially bad when Danes are the ones doing it (which is the case most of the time)
Those are very serious issues stemming from systematic issues with their society which we, as the more economically and socially advantaged part of the country, ought to help fix
Greenland is part of Denmark - their country facing such severe issues is if not our fault then at least our responsibility to help improve
Beyond that, Nazi jokes about Germany, surrender jokes about France, and the increasing amount of vitriol being thrown at Russians
The latter particularly disturbs me, since it often seems to be deeply held prejudices and indeed hatred passed as being "woke".
>I don’t like it when people say bad things about Poland
It's fair if you don't like bad jokes
I don't either
But it is fair to criticise a country from they do / have done
The rapefugee thing on Sweden is not really a joke, as much as it is a extremist talking point based on misinformation
It's complete bullshit, just like the stories on no so called "no-go zones".
I really don't mind being poked fun of, but that seems to be 50% of the teasing coming from Norway and Sweden, and it's long since gotten stale
That's a lot to Greeks
Well clearly you don't live in a city which direct ferry's to both countries
Og til her svenske og norske røvhuller
Ja i er alkoholiske mongoler, men det er jeg er fandme også.
That goes for every single country on the planet
Ja der er sgu nok noget om snakken så.
My parents called me (name)"-Chen", which I guess is more German tradition, than danish
My brother called me Rugge, which is a gibberish version of my name, and my mum also called me "lille frøken himmelblå", meaning "little miss sky-blue (eyes)"
Skiftning in Danish
Hehe, "*minge*"...
Can't say for danish, but a couple of years ago I did an intensive 3 month Duolingo course in Russian
I learned enough to convince people that don't speak russian that I did speak it, but I didn't learn very much
The only phrase I remember was something like "that's my bike", which I'm sure will come in handy

Painfully legal in Denmark and painfully common
Circumcision of boys for non-medical reasons
In Denmark, and from what I gather also most of the civilized world, circumcision of female children is already illegal
We just need to extend that to the boys also
Everyone is against cigarettes but as soon as alcohol or Xanax or any other thing is mentioned, they run away
Prank ringing doorbells in the middle of the night
They are for the most parts though
problem is investigation and proof
Rest in peace Uffe Holm's career then
There is a good reason why it is a good idea that people with criminal records can be elected though: some form of protests against oppression are illegal, but they are seen as saviours in hindsight
A lot of politicians from the former East block has been convicted of something
We tried to do it a few years back
We have crazy popular support for it, something like 80+%.
But it was voted down in Folketinget due to "national security concerns", which translates from bullshit to English as "it would piss off the Jews (in addition to Muslims), therefore it would piss off Israel and by extension also the US".
You can bet your ass that if it had just been a Muslim tradition, it would've been banned with 90% voting yes
Livet er dejligt
I don't particularly like circumcision, but this is the reason I would prefer it to be legal
Better have it in a private hospital than the basement of a church
"But my religion allows me to chop my sons penis in pieces without asking him"
indoctrination at its worst
Yeah, I was really disappointed when that happened
Yeah I agree
If I had to choose between which two of them should be illegal I would definitely choose the one for females, but since we have no such constraints in real life we should aim to make both of them illegal
And
Yes
yes
That is however not as widespread, so that argument is less valid
just male genital mutilation
There is a big difference in how wide-spread it is
The same could be said of female circumcision yet we still made that illegal
Yeah I get that, but I dont see why that is valid reason for it to be legal
If I went out and claimed that my religion says that all babies should have big tribal tattoos around their biceps, I would still be jailed for child abuse if people found out I had done it, even though tattoos can be removed
Fuck, even spanking is illegal
So why should the act of cutting off the skin of the boy's penis be legal, when we already have banned female circumcision for both religious and non-religious reasons
So if it is incentive that is the key driver, would you then say as soon as a large enough group of people start doing something to their children, we should legalise it so they can do it safely
Could be tattoos, piercings or FGM
I believe that will just lead to more damage long term, as it will take way longer for people to stop circumcising
We may as well wait for them to drop whatever religious or cultural ideas that demands it, which can take centuries if they live in a large enough community
In Danish, Nøkken is a hairy manlike monster that lives in swamps and drags people into the water
Reading the comments I feel like there os some miscommunication of what a party is
There is a big difference between what a party entails when being in your twenties and what is means as you get older
All parties I ever attended with my twenty-something friends were BYOB, and the main goal was to get as wasted as possible
Here it makes sense to bring your own, since people drink different amounts and it's annoying to run out of booze
This of course doesn't mean that that people don't share
At more "adult" parties, like weddings or big birthdays it is more common that the host provide wine and beer and at more informal gatherings it's common that each person bring something like a bottle of wine
As a Danish person I would say it's far from universal
For young people most parties seem to be BYOB
You bring your own drink, so you prepare based on how much you expect to drink, and then mostly stick to that
But even then a certain amount of sharing is usual
For more "grown-up" parties I think it's expected that the host provide most but guests will bring a bottle or two which will more likely be shared
Denmark birthdays in school: Usually the person who has their birthday a weekend before school or exact day brings some candy or something for everyone who wants it (some people don't like this or that)
Then they have a birthday at home as well (of course)
&#x200B;
Edit: I live in Denmark, that's why I know
This is not uncommon, in a few Nordic countries too
We call everyone by their first names
Anything else went out of style 50 years ago or so
Gonna need a source on that one, sounds fishy
I don't experience this in Denmark
Usually in my family/friends we bring and share, or the host pays for drinks - if you don't want to share; don't bring
Usually with good friends, there's an unwritten rule that if you paid for drinks, the other one will pay for drinks another time
Exception: The only exception is young people at parties, then we see it as rude if you don't ask first
We hate people who try to mooch/take other people's drinks
Nah, I’ve never encountered that
This
It's not that hard, people
Red solo cups and dressing as cheerleaders and/or Trump
My family's tradition is congratulating siblings of said person, parents, grandparents, and if they are siblings, the others congratulate us
And it was Danish for many centuries before that
I think it’s generally considered cheap in Denmark to keep the alcohol to yourself, though alcohol is way less expensive than it is in Sweden
I'm kinda split in all these comments, there's a difference in culture at a "family party" and a "I'm gonna get smashed party"
I disagree - it'd be considered cheap to keep it for yourself, but it'd  be considered more cheap to not bring your own to the party
And very rude to simply take other peoples without asking, which is what we're talking about here
People share left and right at a party, but if you had a bottle of whiskey and someone else had a bottle gin, you might share or exchange, to get variation in drinks - but if somebody else simply drank your whiskey not having asked you beforehand, that would be very rude
When it's provided and planned and you bring your own: not very polite
Family party could be things like confirmation, whenever someone turns 50/60 etc
and weddings
We can generally tell just by "what sounds right". In some cases, with new additions to the language mostly, there will be some disagreement about what should be the correct article, but overall we just know by "instinct".
Pretty much always you'd know whether the definite article would be -en or -t. Neuter gender or plural gender
I honestly don't know how we do it
I think there are some rules like in German, but for comparison German would have way more rules when it comes to gender
In Danish the case is mostly "What sounds right".
As someone who's still learning German, I would root for "das Nutella". Maybe because it is neuter gender in Danish, which can be interpreted as neutral gender
Edit: I just realised it might change gender depending on context
If it is the jar itself it would be neuter gender: "Nutellaen" but if it out of the jar some might say "nutellaet", plural gender
That makes sense, because my Ukrainian friend almost never uses the word “the” when she writes in English
That's funny, we get a lot of British crime drama
I have no idea what stereotypes there are about the Danes
the swedes try to banter a bit but all they can say is "dansk jävler" or whatever, and it's getting kind of old - and it's got nothing to do with stereotypes
Danes are reserved
I only hate it ‘cause it’s true
I see Dutchmen as passionless VOC employees with no joy in life aprt from profit and tulips, is that entirely wrong
Niflheim - 5° = winter jacket
5° - 10° = t-shirt, shirt and wind jacket
10° - 15° = t-shirt and wind jacket
15° - 20° = t-shirt
20° - 25° = topless
25° - Muspelheim = don't leave the house
I will die
I have never been comfortable in short sleeves or shorts for that matter if it is under 15 C. Although in Denmark you see a ton of people wearing summer clothing by the beginning of March
I presume a (wise) factor in Southern Europe is also protecting your skin from the sun

Ah yes, admiral Nelson
The real villain of the Napoleonic Wars
If you kill them really good, they put your face on a box of matches
Nansen seems criminally underrated by the Norwegians, and he's basically a god damn legend
&#x200B;
Edit: Seriously, why aren't you guys worshipping him more
He was a titan amongst men, a figure that could carry a country on his back, better than lutefisk on bread
Haha that was a good burn
We have to live up to expectations
Our "rivalry" has been memed so much that I feel people would be dissapointed if we did not keep it up
>It would be very weird (and impossible regarding logical consistency) to view Denmark ca 1300 as a country but not Sweden at the same time
Well, Denmark's "birth certificate" was literally written in stone in the around 950 AD whereas the Sweden as we know it today was born with Vasa as you point out
The way I understand it, is that Götaland and Svealand were separate nations but under the same ruler (somewhat like the UK) from around the 11th century and it was not until Vasa, they were considered one nation
>I doubt the Jutes considered themselves "Danes" by 950
It's believed the majority of the Jutes emigrated to Britain by 500, as their lands in Jutland were exhausted
It's actually in the same periode, you can trace the first Danish parliament or *ting* back to, so the Danes went from a tribe to a people (of more more tribes) with a nation long before year 950
The rune stone from 950 is just very concrete and marks the beginning of the Danish state as we know it today similar to Vasa and Sweden
My grandfather organized some underground schools in his town, during the occupation of Denmark in WW2
Apparently, the original school had been seized, and only the younger children were allowed to still get taught
So he organized something for the sxith-form aged children, and kept at it until the place they were got raided
Apparently, during the raid an officer looked through my grandfathers' lunchbox, and lifted the meet on his sandwiches, to check if there were any hidden messages
My grandfather, being a mouthy-sort-of guy, complained saying that was "disgusting" and "now he couldn't eat it", which earned him a beating-up and having to stand against the wall with a gun pointed at the back of his head
Luckily it never got further than that, but I'm unaware of how it became deescalated
My grandmother, his wife, I've been told helped set up the first co-ed union for teachers
I've never had it confirmed by her, as she died before I knew, but the priest at the funeral talked about it during the necrology, and my father later confirmed it
Having known her, I can't say I'm surprised, as I'm aware that my grandfather's mother thought she was "a bad girl" and told my grandfather not to date a "wild girl like that", as she drove a motorbike and had very short hair
Her sister had also had to leave Denmark, after falling in love with, and marrying, a German man
So I think that might not have helped her case
I'm also aware that through my grandfather, I'm related to a man who prosecuted so many witches, that he was 'honoured' in his local church, by having his name written on a bench with thanks for "service to the cross", so
yay
Both grandfathers was part of the rebellion again the german occupation during WWII
Grandfather on mothers side never said much about it but on his chest was to big knife scars from a run in with Gestapo
Grandfather on fathers side was helping distribute illegal papers and documents
None, but the Roman Empire never really got all the way up to Denmark as far as I know
Never, why would we even do that
Traveling by train
Long, pedestrian-only shopping streets
I remember as an exchange student, gaining a bit of weight and how hard it was, not to eat something processed, cheesy or sugary
Like: Just give me some vegetables
Like a zucchini, a carrot or something basic healthy
**Home Cooking and easy healthy options**, was most certainly rare in the US
Like: What constitutes a healthy meal, seems to be very different
And maybe it's because the lobbies, have completely destroyed what constitutes healthy
Like "food" as high school was nothing less than sugar and fats
How's anyone going to focus after eating that
We got so much pizza, all the time
Like, don't get me wrong, it's delicious
But I couldn't stop connecting it to the obesity for sure
Granted, this is 10 years ago
But yea
Eating kebab/shawama
How did people survive before kebab
Here in Denmark we have a ~150% tax on cars, so adding an automatic transmission is an extra $2000-$4500 on top of the price
Automatics are a luxury
Example:
2019 VW Golf 1,5 TSI EVO ACT BlueMotion (130 HP), 6 speed manual, Price: $39,091 (€35,253)
2019 VW Golf 1,5 TSI EVO ACT (150 HP), 7 speed DSG automatic, Price: $43,349 (€39,092)
Don't ask me why the automatic has an extra 20 horsepower with the same engine
I just compared the cheapest 2019 VW golf manual vs
automatic
I had the impression that while shopping streets are aplenty in big cities, pedestrian-only streets (like [Strøget] in Copenhagen) are quite rare
I don't remember New York having any pedestrian-only shopping streets at any rate
When I grew up he was super popular in both Norway and Denmark as well
Absolutely disgusting
Oooh, that looks good
We ship it to Malaysia, where they dump it in the ocean instead  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
Here you have to physically take them from under the counter and place them on the conveyor belt beforehand, and obviously pay for them if you want them
In Denmark, most drive-through restaurants call their drive-through *drive-in*, which in English, is a different type of service as far as I know
Other than that, I can't really come up with any 'misused' or 'fake' English words
Ofc the Germans have a word for it
We do the same in Danish
Actually the influence of English on our language make people put in spacing in words that should be a compound
And personally I've always been confused when words should be a compound in English and when they shouldn't. For example seawater and sea captain
> Actually the influence of English on our language make people put in spacing in words that should be a compound
Urgh
I hate to be a nazi of any kind, but seeing people not compound their words (especially in professional settings, or in official-style text, etc
) just grind me in all kinds of wrong ways
The golden rule is:
**If you can't decide then just divide
I don't have a a catchy sentence for Danish but it's the opposite
Yeah, English is real fast an loose with compound words
I don't think there's often any rhyme or reason to when you should make compound words or not
The best rule of thumb is, I think, when in doubt, don't compound
I wonder if that's where the Danish word "mobning", meaning "bullying", comes from
EDIT: Or, if you got it from us
I don't know how old the root is
Maybe vikings were very concerned about bullying in the workplace
You are right to be the nazi in this case
Unfortunately I think it's a losing battle
I agree
It really sucks, because having compound words is the best feature of our language, if you ask me
some time ago a new absence rule was introduced to danish gymnasiums that received nation-wide hate;
usually, if you were slightly late, you would get 50% absence, but it was changed to 100%. that means that if your bus/train was late or cancelled and/or you came late by a few minutes, in the system, you were never there for the entire period
otherwise I'm quite happy with it
tons of support and more focus on actual learning rather than memorising
When I went to school in the UK, I had no idea you guys had assemblies, and nobody thought to tell me . After a couple of weeks I got a very stern talking to from a teacher for missing all of them
Never in my life had a thought of a sixth form having assembly, much less so often
It sounded horrible
Which, after going to one, I learned that it indeed was
Relatable
So true, same in Denmark
Everyone here gets teached at the same level, unless you're part of a private school
I have no idea what this is
How old are you
I'm 30 and that stopped way before I was born i public schools AFAIK
wait, you don't? even at the humanities type of schools that's kind of a basic thing you have to learn
It still exists in some schools AFAIK, I applied for a job at one where they mentioned it
It was a comprensive school with both sixth form and younger grades - assembly was just done for all levels at the same time
Likely why we had it so often
Sadly for me, I was the only exchange student so they always noticed then I wasn't there
"Atheneskolen" is not a part of gathering gifted kids
It's not a part of any national program or anything you actually hear anything about (as far as I know), my brother and I are very gifted (4
0 GPAs) and I've never even heard of this being an option
There's a national program in gymnasium here despite this, gathering gifted "kids"; but with close to no difference towards actual academic level (The academy for gifted kids)
That's not obligatory in Denmark, but possible to select when part of the STX (Follow up on primary school) gymnasium here
we just have one thing called "mathematics", and the teacher takes you through all of the different aspects (we have the same subjects for one, two, or three years depending on what is obligatory and what your chosen studies are)
This ^ Atheneskolen is mainly just for people whose parents have enough resources to send them there, who then also happen to have fine grades
No way they ever even informed people about its existence, much less sought out students for it
isn't it kinda convoluted to divide the different aspects of mathematics
I mean, some of them overlap a lot
I've got a friend studying in the US at the moment; she says that the short, semester-long classes and focus on memorisation makes it hard to remember things in the long run
I can see how that would be a big problem when seperating subjects like you describe
in regards to breaks, danish students have 6 weeks in the summer, one in autumn, two-three in the winter, and several holidays spread in spring
I think there was a study done that showed that regardless of how long your holiday was, the effects wear off after a few days
as for maths, I'm a complete retard at it myself - some people are just better at it than others, and a good teacher can really make a difference too
it doesn't help that I work with chemistry, though
Every time I've been to Scotland I've had haggis at least once
It's not as offal as everyone says
I was really pleasantly surprised by Czech "Svíčková na smetaně". Not only was it great, it wasn't too expensive either
Haggis in Scotland, pierogi in Poland and lohikeitto in Finland - all three dishes I had never tried before, but all three of them tasted amazing
That reminds me of a bit from a Lee Mack comedy show, where he says that the French didn't want the Olympics to be held in London because "their food is shit".
He then goes on to say that no Frenchman will ever experience the pleasure of coming home to lunch as a 14 year old boy, thinking they'll just get beans on toast and then discover that "Hello, there's little sausages in there
It can be quite heavy, but after a long day of hiking in the highlands a solid meal is exactly what my body needs
Well, a few years after I tried it I heard from someone that in most restaurants in Scotland, what they call haggis is not really the haggis with intestines cooked in a sheep's stomach, but rather some meat dish made to taste sort of like the real deal
I don't know if this is true or not
Lohikeitto is amazing - and we tasted it right after a round of ice-fishing, so a bowl of soup was perfect
None, for the nation, we've only ever had this one
Oldest flag country here
North Sea empire, since it was literally one of the last flags before Dannebrog
Didn’t we have some trouble because of the Muhammad Drawings
That's not a flag
But they associated the flag with drawings or am i being stupid
Well they did go around burning it as a result, so I guess some people didn't like the flag
At parties we play a game we call “Dåse” (translated “can”), where 2 or more people compete against each other in breaking a can in half with their hands, in a karate-chop kinda way
It usually ends in a bloody hand and many regrets that day after as your hand will turn blue because of the repeated slamming into a table
We do that too
So many tables would just be filled with blood because of this game
Absolutely - when I went on an exchange to the UK, I taught the game to the friends I made at my Sixth Form
We would literally have to wipe the blood off tables, we were so brutal
By the end, half of my entire year walked around looking like they just had a fistfight
Honestly can't believe we did that to ourselves
Nope it's awkward as fuck
Wish people wouldn't put you on the spot to perform for them
Everyone knows it: “rød grød med fløde”
"download open source server-software til din computers harddisk"
hvad søren
"Rød grød med fløde" er da hvad vi siger, vi danske knejte
Røget ørred
What does it actually mean
"Wow, I can almost understand it
How dare you
Only Swedes can insult is in this way
Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberry

> different interpretations of history
I don't think "Alexander the Great was a Slav" really counts as an "interpretation" of history
For hundreds of years we have been wanting at least Skåne back, but now you have ruined it, so let's just keep the borders were they are now
As a Dane, I can assure you, we are proud to own the heart of Canadian culture that is Hans Island
That's funny, because I actually heard that Axel Makkedønsen was Danish
Ludo, Uno and Matador
All great games
Not sure what are traditional board games
My family plays Bezzerwisser, Alias & Partners
Probably Aalborg and Esbjerg, our 4th and 5th biggest cites, since we do have smaller towns and cities such as Roskilde, Billund and even Jelling which are likely more known (at least outside of Europe)
Roskilde is due to the Roskilde Festival, as well as the viking ship museum
Billund is because they have our second largest Airport, as well as Legoland
Jelling has the famous Rune-stones placed by Harald Bluetooth
It is both Denmark's birthmark, as well as the story as to why Bluetooth is called Bluetooth (the connection via the internet)
There aren’t any big cities, at least not by European standards other than Copenhagen
Østrig-Ungarn - but it's also referred to as the Habsburg monarchy
"det østrig-ungarske rige" or "østrig-ungarn"
Østrig-Ungarn
Det fimsede cykelstyroverskæg emperium
Østrig-Ungarn
Det Østrig-Ungarske kejserrige/imperium
Similar in Danish: Østrig-Ungarn
We are extremely flat
Also, the weather is shit
The Danish constitution was established in 1849 and has been changed four times:
* 1866: The king and the largest landowners(Lords) get the right to more seats in the Landsting, which was one of the two chambers of the Folketing
* 1915: Women and servants get the right to vote
* 1920: Southern Jutland is returned to Denmark
The King cannot declare war or make peace without the consent Danish parliament
* 1953: The voting age is lowered, a conditional female succession to the throne is introduced and the Landsting is dissolved, so that Denmark gets a one-chamber system with the Folketing as the only national representative assembly
Our constitution is from 1849 and has been changed 4 times
It is not easy to change the constitution in Denmark, it needs to go through 4 steps:
There needs to a majority of the Parliament (Folketinget) voting for the change
There needs to be an election for a new Parliament
The new parliament need a majority vote for the change
There needs to be a referendum where 40% of all eligible to vote has to vote in favor of the change
To change the constitution you need:
a) A majority in the parliament
B) Then a majority in the parliament after the next election
C) Then at most 6 months after the proposed change is voted for a public vote is held, where 40% must participate and a majority agree to change the constitution
It was also changed in 1855 after the three year war
Cus they assumed Denmark would be allowed to make Slesvig part of Denmark, so when we weren't, they had to change it
That's also the main reason it was changed in 1866
We lost Slesvig and Holsten completely
It was changed 5 times
It was changed in 1855 after the three year war
Cus they assumed Denmark would be allowed to make Slesvig part of Denmark, so when we weren't they had to change it
It was changed in 1866 because we lost Slesvig and Holsten completely
It was changed in 1915 when women and people who didn't own their place of residence were allowed to vote
It was changed in 1920 when we got North Slesvig (Sønderjylland) back
And it was changed in 1953, when Landstinget (a  second congress excusively for the wealthy) was abolished
They used that same opportunity to change the rules for inheriting the throne so a woman could become regent, thus making our Queen heir to the throne rather than just another princess, and the royal family also gave up the rest of their constitutional power
You're almost correct
To change the Danish constitution all of the following must happen:
* A majority of parlament must vote in favor of the proposed change
* An election to parlament must occur
* A majority of the newly elected parlament must vote in favor of the [exact same] proposed change
* At the latest, six months after the proposed change has been approved (twice) by parlament, it must be put to a public vote
The proposed change must pass by a majority, **and the majority must represent at least 40% of all eligible voters**
* The King/Queen must approve the law
(pure formality, but technically required for a law to pass
If he/she refuses to sign it, there's a separate procedure to follow, but that's out of the scope of this thread)

Ahhhh I see, didn’t read it carefully enough
[Egern]
The only consonant sound is N.
Egern - ˈeˀjʌn
Danish is pretty hard to learn so I don’t think non-native speakers would be able to pronounce it
The closest in English would be “eyern”
"Egern" No, just like any other danish word we don't pronounce half the letters, so with some help you most likely can but 100% that your first guess will be quite off

We put them in the fridge
Eggs have to be in the fridge in the supermarket
Rules from the Danish Ministry of Food and Environment states that eggs have to be stored and transported at 12 degrees C or below
In reality this means the supermarket keeps them int the fridge at 5 degrees C or less, as this is the temperature most other refrigerated goods has to be stored at
I don't know anyone who doesn't store them in the fridge at home
I keep them in the fridge because stores keep them refrigerated
Though I have recently been living with some family members who have chickens of their own, and they do not store the eggs from those in the fridge
I have heard that apparently in Denmark, eggs for commercial use are washed in aa way that removes some sort of natural protection that normally is on the outside of the shells, which would make sense to me
Eggs from the store have a practically squeaky clean texture compared to the homegrown eggs I've been eating lately, which have a more rough shell texture
But the whole washing thing could also just be a myth
I really don't know
I have never seen anyone store eggs elsewhere than the fridge
it depends how they're treated at the "factory"
in Denmark they are treated in such a way that they need to be stored in a fridge
in the Netherlands for example, they do NOT use this treatment at the factory, and thus the fridge is actually having the opposite effect
Store at room temp
I dont remember the details but i heard some professor explain why, on the radio a couple of years ago
something with condensation, after the treatment, requires them to be cool (to prevent condensation)'
If you're some random person with a chicken and you take an egg from that chicken, just store it on the counter or whatever
dont put it in the fridge
In Denmark they’re always refrigerated in-store
Historically, when I have bought a 10-pack living alone, they're typically gone within a week

How to pronounce onsdag (Wednesday)
On the one hand, we have people pronouncing it on-s-dag (with a similar O sound to Odin) and on the other hand we have people pronouncing it ond-s-dag (with a similar O sound to evil)
Politics in Denmark as a whole are stupid and useless
I used to play videogames with a bunch of northerners once, and for about 2 years I thought they would actually go drink tea with their family whenever they said “gotta go, tea’s ready”.
The fact that they would sometimes use the same phrase when getting cup of tea didn’t help much
Soup
Hmpf
with *butter*?? do you *want* to get diabetes
You guys have pepernoten too
Yes
It's amazing, the butter mixed with the creaminess is a godsend, and I'll never apologize for loving it
My blood pressure just spiked
That's not pizza
It's a pie
But we are an Aldi North nation
It's just more pizza
I think they’re the same
We call them pebernødder though
Its extra spiked
Taste is subjective if course
But I certainly don't think so
That's not always a good thing
Lets fight
When has more pizza never been a good thing ??
Yeah
They’re reserved for December only
We'll send our navy, once we've bought weapons for it
Me too, I thought pebernødder were a Danish thing
Guess we have even more in common than I first thought lol
In my experience karaoke isn't very popular here
Although some songs that will always get people singing along, at least after a couple of beers, are what we call dansktop
The most popular ones include "Himmelhunden", "I en lille båd der gynger", "Hvorfor går Louise til bal".
"Hvor skal vi sove i nat" is probably most "karaoke-like" of the bunch
Train or car inside the country, unless you live in Aalborg and often commutes to Copenhagen then a plane ticket might be the better option (depending on time and money spent)
Most of Europe I would travel by car, I would only take trains as far as Hamburg or Berlin
I would take a car as far as Hungary, Croatia, most of northern Italy and Southern France, I would fly to Spain, fly to the UK, fly to southern Italy and Greece etc
Exactly
Unfortunately that night train to Prague is long gone
Yeah flying to Paris is cheaper for me than going by train just across Denmark
It’s so dumb
Until they stop making planes so much artificially cheaper I really don’t think it’s fair to scold the common person for choosing flying
It is
I truly love night trains
Luckily some of them are coming back, though I don’t think Prague is included in the plans for Copenhagen
Denmark similarly fucking hates it when we’re described as socialist
The Nordic countries are not socialist
Denmark is in fact one of the easiest countries bureaucratically to start a private business
Ever heard of MÆRSK, Ikea, Spotify, Lego, Nokia
Ah yes, those wonderful totally not capitalist companies
We just have welfare and unions
Both of which are
okay and I’m grateful for them but with various maaaaajor problems
Did you [try to google it
It's mainly based on stealing rightfully Danish land, being cunts and speaking weird
And of course IKEA
Exactly what a socialist would say
North Korea isn’t really socialist though, and definitely not democratically socialist
It’s really just as authoritarian as a country can be and this is due to their actual ideology, Juche, which preaches individual freedoms, but in reality the state just uses it to control the masses
In reality North Korea is just a monarchy, and it is extremely authoritarian making it difficult to even say wether it’s left or right leaning
Sure Kim Jong Un might not call himself a king, but he inherited the country from his father, and when he dies it will be one of his children or his sister who inherits it, which is how a monarchy functions
The only thing that’s sure is that it’s definitely not capitalistic, but that doesn’t automatically make it socialistic
North Korea has even attempted to distance itself from communism as they removed all mentions of the word in their constitution in 2009
The only good outcome of the whole *US deciding to misinterpret socialism* thing is super annoyed Danish right wing politicians having to explain Americans Denmark isn't socialist
> /u/Ap97567 a bit of background: he isn't introduced as such but Johan Norberg is considered somewhat of a liberal extremist in Sweden and has for a long time been employed by the Swedish industrialist union
His description of the last 150 years of Swedish history would be disputed by other people
I mean, it does say he's a fellow at the Cato Institute
Sure to non-Americans, that might not be very obvious, but the Cato Institute is a pretty well-known libertarian think-tank, so if you are just slightly politically interested, it should not be a hidden fact
It's certainly considered one of the reasons why
I would argue that one can't point to exactly one reason why the workers movement succeeded in Denmark in a way it didn't in many other countries
There are some key point one can point to - the overall public and political acceptance of unions, the Kanslergade agreement (often considered the biggest reason for the Nordic Models emergence), the great success of pro-workers literature, progressive labour market policies, and even our situations in World War Two
As it is, the unions hold so much power in Denmark, that we don't even have a minimum wage - we don't need to
They are probably the reason why we are able to sustain the Nordic Model, but not the sole reason why we even got it
Han refererer til Nordic countries
Interested in why you think it wouldn’t work just because you have larger population
I agree with you on most besides the last point - that unions are especially powerful in Denmark
I would rather say that they are influential as part of the institutions of the country
The three part model of employers, employees (represented through Unions) and the government means that there is relatively little work-related conflict, as all laws pertaining to working conditions are discussed with unions and employee organisations beforehand
In this sense, the "we are all in this together" is not only political rhetoric, but something reflected in actual practice
In this regard class consciousness in Denmark is relatively low, as collaboration rather than resistance is the key word
Unions in France tend to be more autonomous, assertive and political, hence the prevalence of strikes
In this sense unions in France might be more powerful, but not necessarily as influential as unions in Denmark
I am in no way religious but i still pay the church tax
It’s so little annually and i do like going to the graveyard to visit my grandparents etc, so church tax
Meh, it’s fine
That’s a fair point
Like I said it’s hard to really pinpoint their exact ideology beyond just being authoritarian, so I don’t disagree with that label
Yeah, the danish system and public very much depends on the unions being strong
My mum is rather high up in one of the biggest unions, and the amount of power they wield is crazy
They can basically fuck over the entire country if they wanted to - and most would support them
At the 2018 negotiations between state workers and the regions, 500
000 public employee went on strike from March until June and even by the end, most Danes supported them doing so
For us unions are seen as integral and something you basically have to be a member of no matter what
Out of 2,7 million workers in Denmark, around 2,2 million of those are members of a union
Yes
That is the whole point of this model
And that is also why Nordic countries implement ways to regulate peoples health
In Denmark for example there is an extra tax on sugar
In Sweden alcohol is only sold in stateowned stores with high tax, and stuff like that
The government needs to take measures to keep the population healthy to keep spending down from hospitals
So if the US was to implement the Nordic model, you need the full package
Edit: and of course you have to drasticly raise taxes
But in the end you earn less, but you also spend less on various things like healthcare and education
It depends very much on the industry and the company you work for
I have never been a member of a union, and I don't think many of my colleagues are either
I have never worked for a company that negotiated salary or working conditions with a union anyway
We rely on the civil servents act (funktionærloven), which is also really good, giving us at least 5 weeks vacation and so on
Numbers of members are falling though and my cynical mind don't really see the youth being as big supporters of the unions as their peers
We have to cherish what we have
[The Julekalender - Støvledans]
cool :D
I think you would have to be a native speaker to know all the different meanings and ways you can use fuck and shit
And there are of course differences between native speakers from different countries
I guess I'm just fucked since I will never know that shit
Uhm
they know i paid the tax because the state can see who does and who doesnt
They deduct it from what i earn, every year
Ofc everyone can visit their dead family, i just dont mind paying a tiny tiny tax for this
And what prevents me from lying is being a decent and honest person
Nothing other than my own moral and ethics prevents me
They actually call themselves the **Democratic People's** Republic of Korea
Which is even sadder and funnier because it couldn't be further from the truth
Sure, but that doesn't really change the numbers
When there are 2,7 million workers in Denmark, and 2,2 of those are member of a union, then there's no doubt that being a member is the most common
Just because some people aren't, and that those often congregate in the same type of jobs and professions, doesn't mean that it isn't overall the most common thing
According to every single article I've been able to find, membership numbers are going up, though not by much
From 16 to 17 it went up by 0,40%, for example
I can nemt husk back when it first blev sendt in the fjernsyn
I haven't seen den i mange years, and selvom den er nostalgisk, så have it not aged so well
Your numbers indicate that 81,5% of workers are organized in a union, when I google it, I get numbers saying ~67%.
According to "Danmarks Statistik" the total membership count for all unions (including managers, academics and unions outside the main organization) is 1,868,332 as of 31/12/2020
So I think your numbers might be a bit old
Source:
Edit:
The numbers for "a-kasser" (unemployment insurance) is almost exactly 2,2 million (2,202,999), even though many unions also have unemployment insurance, there are also many that are independent
Well, [DST says something else] It has gone slightly up in the short term, but union participation today is nothing like in the days where the vast majority of the rights we have today were won
Indeed, my good sir
Why does it bother you that i dont give a shit about paying a very small amount in church taxes when im agnostic
I pay because i want to
Because even though i dont believe, i think some parts of religion are worth supporting
Because the internet
The church will know who paid and who didnt, and in the end they dont care cos everyone is welcome in our church
And i pay because i like the general message of jesus christ, to love one another
And i like to visit my deceased family
I got them from a 2018 article, though I concede the article might have had them wrong, seeing as DS says different
I do agree they are a more trustworthy source
That being said, according to DS the numbers are still going up
You know, thats an american thing
That doesnt happen here
we dont let churches inherit our money and shit
I guess you would easily be as baffled about how little money the church gets in donations, as we are with how much your churches get
Here, the danish church gets their money from the state, and compared to usa, that is just a small allowance
Good thing we are not catholics in my country then
And i said churches in my country do NOT inherit money
You probably can, but people dont
I have seen elder care homes recieve large inheritances, but not the church
No, but you do have people donating their money to, tbh, ridiculous shit like tv evangelicans or an obviously corrupt, luckily, ex president
That sounds exactly like something a bad guy with an awful language would say
My Greek Wedding
Well, if the saying that you never forget to ride a bike once you've learned it is true, then I *can* do it, but I won't do it and haven't done it for the last 15 years or so
I hate biking - I can't really explain why, but I just think it's really uncomfortable and I feel like I'm constantly close to falling over - so I have only ever done it when my parents forced me to (and at a couple of school exercise days where it was also mandatory)
I seem to remember I was 5 when I learned it
Edit as I missed your last question: I don't think I know anyone who have never learned to ride a bike
That would be *extremely* unusual here
One of the mandary school bike trips I mention took place in kindergarten where we were around 6 years old
So yeah, they expected everyone to have learned it by that age
I think I was 5
Everybody I know, knows how to bike
But I'm a Dane, so I'd be surpriced if I knew somebody who didn't know how to ride a bike
Yes though I learned it pretty late at around 7
4 years old
i got a bike as a birthday present when i was 4
a few days later i had learned it
We had a 16/17 years exchange student from France over as well
We just assumed she would be able to bike
she wasn’t. It was not a good experience when we put her on a bike
I’ve never seen a 17 year who wasn’t able to bike before here in Denmark
Like I’ve been put on a bike since I was three or something
We bike almost everywhere
I think I was around 7
But before that I had ridden kids' bicycles with supporting side wheels
I don't remember when i learned to ride but my four year-old nephew just did
I have never in my life met an adult who did not know how to ride a bike
To me learning to ride a bike is like learning to tie you're shoes
It's just part of a normal upbringing
Same for me too xD
I've never thought that people can't ride their bicycles, especially because i cycle 15+km daily
> I know the Danes sometimes call us mountain monkeys, "fjeldaber"
It's not a particularly nice thing to say, so it's mostly used by tabloids whenever there's something sport related about Norway
In Denmark we call them ikea fags
No offense (Unless u swedish)
Skovperkere
Feel free to use it
Of course
We were mostly taught about the Holocaust, and how the war affected Denmark
My class went to Berlin and visited a concentration camp, and also the Jewish monument next to Brandenburger Tor
We're basically taught that our soldiers fought their absolute hardest, but recognised that they were fighting a losing battle
The anniversary of the invasion on the 9th of April is known as "The day of the Siege" and the anniversary of the liberation on the 4th of May is known as "liberation day".
We're taught that the Danish army had the wisdom to know a losing battle and to surrender for the sake of less blood shed
Of course this doesn't mean that there wasn't a huge underground resistance in the years to come
My own grandmother was even part of it, and can still recall shocking and traumatising events from her childhood about living in the resistance
Viking
We were vikings
So ofcourse we're romanticiseing it
Prob viking age
Chicken is by far the most popular but the traditional christmas dinner does include stuffed duck
Exactly the same here
We just spell it Mortensaften
For Christmas many families eat duck as well, although pork is just as common
Also fairly common to eat duck (some will rather have a goose) on mortens eve, the evening before mortens day in november
Oh I don't know anyone who celebrates that so I forgot
For Jutland, I would say Struer
Years of failed city planning
In Zealand, easily Brøndby Strand
Perhaps more a southern suburb than an actual city, but goddamn, you have to look far to find anything nearly as terrible
Long complexes of massive soviet looking apartment blocks, surrounded by apartment complexes that are basically ghettos
Aside from that, boring detached house areas with no charm whatsoever
Usually the areas around the coasts on eastern Zealand are very attractive and expensive, but Brøndby Strand is an utter nightmare
&#x200B;
Vallensbæk, Ishøj and Hundige are the next suburbs when you drive south along the coast away from Copenhagen
While improvements, they as well are also not too charming, but after Hundige you sorta leave the Copenhagen area and get to Greve, Karlslunde and Solrød, which are very fine areas, and almost a complete 180 from the neighbouring areas
Not mock, no
I've been questioned about it several times, though - it sounds just Jutish enough that Copenhagener's find it quaint, but just Copenhagenish enough that Jutes find it foreign
The fact that one of my parents is a foreigner only adds a layer to it
In general, though, it's not a strong accent - Rigsdansk with noticeable traces of something else, but not noticeable enough to pin-point what it is
My English accent is similar; It doesn't sound non-native, but it also doesn't sound particular to any one place
Brits think it sounds American, Americans think it sounds British
I just refer to it as "Mid-Atlantic"
I like to make fun of the capital's accent, but the real outlier is actually my specific accent
All the time
I love it
I have a very strong Vendelbo accent, which is like a farmers accent
My friends from the city like to make fun of it but always in a playful manner, never malicious
I like it, because it makes me feel special that i grew up on a farm while they grew up in the city
There are a lot of Danish dialects, I'm just lucky to be from one of the less notable ones
There's is a lot of mockery between the different dialects though
I'm from the eastern part of Central Jutland so I absolutely have a dialect like everyone else in the country
It's not one of the dialects that others generally have a problem understanding though, it's just a *very* flat and uneventful dialect
There's absolutely no "fun" about it
There's no "melody" to it *at all* and there's no big ups and downs in tone or anything
There's not even a weird tendency to add "soft D" sounds to every word like they have in Copenhagen
Hotels
com did a survey about Danish dialects some years ago where they asked Danes about the most beautiful dialect, the ugliest dialect and the dialect that's easiest to understand
The Copenhagen dialect was easy to understand but the ugliest one as well according to the results for example
My "Midtjylland" (Middle/Central Jutland) dialect is one of the easiest to understand, middle of the road in "beauty" and the least ugly
It's simply that it's such a "neutral" dialect I think
It's hard to really hate it and there's nothing that really stands out enough about it to make it particularly beautiful either
So while it's not particularly beautiful it's so "neutral" that no one really voted for it as the ugliest one either
In a sense you could argue that it's the most "basic" way of speaking Danish I suppose
Just flat mumbling without anything in particular going on
So no, I don't get mocked for it
People in Copenhagen or whatever may comment on it being "jysk" (from Jutland) if I'm the only one in a group that isn't from Copenhagen or whatever but they have no problem understanding it
Ligge/lægge (laying) and sidde/sætte (sitting) are common grammatical mistakes
Basically, the i-form is used for when you're already in position
You "ligger" in bed, and you "sidder" in a chair
The æ-form is used when you're *doing* something
You "lægger" a pencil on a table, and you "sætter" the chair down unto the ground
When people use the wrong article in spoken Danish
Unfortunately we do not have any specific rules for when we use en or et - we just have to remember it :) It is easier in English: a or an, or German: ein, eine, ein :)
And there are even words, where Danes cannot agree:
En/et hamster (a hamster)
En/et gummi (a rubber)
Or words where the word have a different meaning:
En vår (one spring)
Et vår (one cover)
Oh and en/et is also the word for then number one
nutids-r (present -r), which is adding an r after verbs when they are in present tense
then there is making spaces between compound words
this is especially common among people on their phones a lot, as phone autocorrect doesn't seem to know that the nouns have to be together
Yeah, it's about the same
However, for example sætte would also be used for yourself, so while in English you'd say "I sit on the chair" and "I'll sit down on the chair", in Danish you'd say "I sidder on the chair" (Jeg sidder på stolen) and "I sætter me on the chair" (Jeg sætter mig på stolen), so there are subtle differences
I'm guessing it's very similar to German though
Here it varies a lot I think - it is not required by law, but depends on the company, school and union you are affiliated with
I have an internship coming up as a part of my education and was told that I shouldn't count on getting paid, by other students and my union
I was lucky enough to get a paid internship, but otherwise I would just get my SU (monthly student grant) and the company would just cover any transportation costs, which I guess might be less of an incentive for companies to pay students, as you can survive without
I feel like a common denominator for paid ones, when I was looking at internship ads, was the size of the company
Only the really large companies (like Nestle) were paid
I graduated from business school and never heard of a paid internship
On the other hand most of us had well payed student positions
When you live in another EU country you are to be treated as any other citizen with all which that entails
Related to this EU agreement is also a law that states that member countries needs to treat other EU citizens in their country on the same level as their own citizens
So in your example, if Italy would provide social security and pension to their own citizens, then they should do the same for the Belgian man
Though, you often see some national rules bending this a bit, where one need to do something to qualify for the benefit that the national citizens doesn't need to do
Absolutely unnecessary
Thousands of people sleep on the streets every night there, yet a fucking company needs 10 skyscrapers
London, good metro
Those noisy, hot and cramped trains are some of the worst I have tried
Not to mention the maze-like stations without any safety measures towards the rails
Yea true
Capitalism sucks
Always come back to the non-translation of "Die Hard: With a Vengeance" to "Die Hard: Mega Hard".
Translated into stupider English
The RomCom, Friends with Benefits, is translated to "Bollevenner" in Danish, which essentially transforms it from a fairly innocent-sounding euphemism to basically being called "Fuck Buddies".
Not quite answering the question, but the Danish subtitles for "Yippie ki yeah motherfucker" in Die Hard was hilariously translated to "Goodbye, brother Shit", brother Shit being a really 1980s specific curse word
It just has the completely wrong vibe and sounds hella formal
Well, the British (Comedy
) film "Keeping Mum" was translated to "Svigermor(d)" which is difficult to translate directly back into english for you guys, but "svigermor" translates to "mother-in-law" and "mord" translates to "Murder
" So it's a bit of a silly pun I always found kinda funny
The second Hobbit movie, the Desolation of Smaug, was translated into Danish as *Dragen Smaugs Ødemark*, which is literally "The Dragon Smaug's wasteland". It always struck me as such a weird thing - for one, it's an incredibly prosaic and wordy title, but why did they need to specify that Smaug was, in fact, a dragon
Like who is going into the second movie in this series going "wait, who is this Smaug guy and why does he have a wasteland
The movie Basketball Diaries was "translated" to The Streets of New York in Denmark
I remember the subtitles in Die hard on tv translating the epic phrase "Yippie-Ki-Yay MotherFucker
" To "Yippie-Ki-Yay bror lort" which means (Yippie-Ki-Yay shit brother)
Swearing was odd in older subtitles - like how it was decided that "pikansjos" (dick anchovie) should be the standard Danish swear word in films even though it's very niche and seldom used in real life
Well, "bror lort" was slang at the time
I remember it being used in the early 90's.
Yes, it means the same thing, but one is a euphemism while the other is very literal about saying it
The English title is a euphemism while the Danish title is very literal in its meaning
Lol yeah that's true, subtitles always seemed much more colourful than our actual swearing vocabulary
Here it's called De Skøre Riddere which means The Crazy (or Silly) Knights
Haha
Undercover Blues was Gunpowder, Bullets and Diapers here
Got punched in the face by a British guy in southern Spain
Got stolen my bag with my computer in it while biking and leaving it in the back basket
Being robbed while biking is quite common in Copenhagen
I have had a few bikes stolen and was shot in the head with an airgun
Because a friend of mine threw a snowball through the shooters window
The shooter threw a snowball first
I guess he was mad that he missed, and my friend did not
EDIT:  And also a break in in our house once, an in our car another time
And someone stole my phone in a changing room once
It seems like getting hit while in Spain is a universal experience
Huh, didn’t know that
The majority of Danish songs I listen to are guilty pleasures lol
Denmark has a giant “bad music” industry, we were behind both Barbie Girl and Uh ih uh ah ah and ai ai ai I’m your little butterfly
For modern songs I’d say [Niklas] [Icekiid] [Kidd] [Nik og Jay] and [Benny Jamz] are some good places to start
In the reaaally obscure category are people like [Lille Heroin] [Pattesutter] and [Jesu Brødre] but I’d say they require some Danish knowledge
Don't forget our "Overly explicit music for no reason" phase back in the 2000's. Sol over Gudhjem by Torrpedorr etc
Nik og Jay - [En Dag Tilbage]
I’d say Tessa, Pattesutter and Suspekt fills that niche quite well today
I don’t really feel like it counts because it’s literally a children’s song
Oh of course, how could I forget him
They are not ubiquitous
I've mainly seen them in older office buildings/schools and such
In people's houses [these] are by far the most common type
Not uniquituous in Denmark at all
Most houses just have ordinary ones that open to the side, while apartments abd such will typically have the ones that open up/outwards
I have only seen windows like the ones in your link once
They're only common in apartment buildings here
I've never seen a house with them
In Denmark those windows are uncommon in houses, where windows will generally open outwards
But in apartments and multi-storey buildings where windows often are inward opening (to facilitate cleaning without the use of ladders)  they are pretty much the norm
It obviously varies with the age of the building, with the price of the building etc
but you can get all sorts of "super advanced" windows
Those windows aren't particularly "crazy" or whatever
Here's another "super advanced" window from the Danish company Velux: [This Window Transforms Into A Balcony with The Touch of A Button]
Windows in houses are generally outward opening, but in muti-storey buildings, it is common to mount inward opening windows, so they can be cleaned on both sides without using a ladder
They are not used that much in Scandinavia either
That's a Danish murermestervilla if I ever saw one
Yeah that's right
But I think in older apartment buildings you still opt for the outward type because of their design
Like this [one]
I actually do it myself hanging out the window - slightly dangerous
Most people hire a guy to do it
They usually come with a lift, although sometimes they also use ladders
It's quite cheap compared to other services in Denmark - most people probably do it (have someone else do it) once or twice per year
Yes, if they are built before the war, then definitely
But already in the 50'ies sliding windows had become common
Yes
I lived in a dorm from the 50s where you could open windows both horizontally and vertically
Now I live in a building from the 1910s with new old-style windows
I don't really watch Youtube stuff from my own country
Most of what I know of from my country is for kids

It's very common here, both between men and women when you meet someone you don't know, or in formal settings of course
If it's someone you already know it depends on how well you know them, whether or not you shake hands or exchange a hug
Fun fact: Last year (or the year before, if I don't remember correctly) there was a bit of a controversial law passed that stated that when you're attending the ceremony, which grants you danish citizenship, you have to shake hands with the attending public servant, who hands you the official declaration
The argument was that it is part of being "danish" to shake hands, regardless of your background or believes
I'm not a fan of that law myself, but the law sparked a big discussion of the meaning of a handshake
Guys here will often do a handshake when they go their separate ways, and also often when meeting
Look, it's just too intimate for a Scandinavian to hug another man when meeting him
We might short-circuit and catch on fire
>If it's someone you already know it depends on how well you know them, whether or not you shake hands or exchange a hug
Or just a "Hey
" or just a friendly "punch" on the shoulder or whatever if it's a close friend you see all the time
Having to shake hands or hug your close friend that you see nearly every day would feel weird to me
He'd likely just get a "Hey <name or nickname>!" and nothing else
Same with colleagues you see every day really, they'd just get a "Good morning
:)" when I entered the office (or wherever we work in this fictional example) in the morning
If there was a new guy in the office he'd get a handshake though, just to introduce myself etc
I find a handshake very formal and "cold" unless it's during an introduction, and hugging all your colleagues would just be weird
I think it also depends on the situation to some extent
If it's a close friend who drops by all the time he may just get a "Hey
" when he shows up for the 5th time that week, but if it's a friend you see less often who shows up to your yearly Christmas party or whatever, he'd be more likely get a hug
The more informal the setting and relationship is the less likely it is that I'll shake hands with them
And if we're into the "Hugging stage" of knowing each other, the more often we see each other the less likely it is I'll give them a hug I think
I don't mind hugging though so if a person goes in for a hug I'll just hug them back
It would just feel weird to me if I had to hug the same close friend every day
>  If it's someone you already know it depends on how well you know them, whether or not you shake hands or exchange a hug
Yup
If it's close friends you get/give a hug instead - regardless of gender
> The argument was that it is part of being "danish" to shake hands, regardless of your background or believes
I mean that makes sense
If you're a muslim man who refuses to shake hands with a Danish woman, that's any sort of danish culture test failed right there
Hard to think of a more radically non-danish position
I actually love the "handshake + one arm hug thing" it's not as intimate as a hug, but at the same time is less formal than a handshake alone
Cats, but unfortunately I feel like in Denmark it is often a one-sided battle
Cat people most often respect dog people but it's not always dog people respect cat people
Because unfortunately some people don't believe cats should be considered pets
I know it's a very small minority, but they are prevalent
Ironically it's often the people who complain about cats that starts the problems
Often farmers who don't sterilise their cats and then dump them in town, creating problems
Total cat person
I think my country is probably 50/50
A while ago I believe there was a survey that proved worldwide people preferred dogs so probably dogs
By "most often" I meant pretty much always
I don't know any people with cats who dislikes dogs
In Denmark we have a "Dog law" which is there to prevent wild dogs and other dog breeding related causes to control the dog population
It also includes you have to break if a dog runs in front of your car (IIRC)
But on the other hand we don't have a cat law that should prevent the same things, which I think is stupid
And it's almost always farmers and a few people who don't got the money to sterilise their cats, that keeps these problems flowing
We have unfortunately seen more and more cats from the wild coming into facilities due to there being no law to prevent people from dumping kittens
All of this unfortunately also leads to some dog owners feeling superior as cats doesn't have the same law as dogs
Edit: Sorry for the little rant, but this is something that means quite a lot to me as my mother and I are actively trying to reduce the wild cat population in our town with as many cats surviving as possible
Don't know if it counts but we have really heavy dialects that can be very hard if not almost impossible if you aren't from that part of the country
Vendelbomål and sønderjysk is very different from "rigsdansk".
Have you seen how big it is
And that it's made out of a gajillion islands, with one of them being the western half of Papua
The German-speaking regions come from the former Prussian Rhine Province which *you* annexed following WW1, so quite the opposite in fact
It's not the only factor, but distance helps isolating people, making it possible for different languages to develop
More importantly is that it's consisting of a lot of islands with jungles, mountains and other kind of tough terrain, that are spread out over a vast distance, there are over 5000 km between the westernmost and easternmost point of Indonesia
Russia on the other hand is mostly steppes, where vast distances can be covered on horseback
Edit: Also I added that the Western half of Papua is part of Indonesia, where they have like 250(there are over a thousand on the entire island) of the 700 languages in Indonesia
DLF Seeds A/S is a danish company that sells about 30% of the worlds " forage and turf seed" - grass, mostly for either sporting locations or animal gracing
Most of this is for other companies, but they do also sell a bit directly to customers under different names like turfline, or Johnsons Lawn Seed
There major customers are other companies like farms or the  UEFA Champions League
They also sell a large share of vegetable seed like beet seed and that sort of thing
Hartmann A/S
They produce egg trays from recycled paper
The customers are businesses, which fill the the trays with eggs and then distribute them to retailers
ISS is a huge Danish "facility management" provder (they do cleaning etc)
They have around 500,000 employees worldwide and thus one of the largest companies in the world measuered by number of employees
Maersk is the largest container shipping company in the world
there's 5
8 km to my work place - i use an electric scooter to get there
takes 13-15 minutes
and there's 3 different busses going from near my home - and one to my work place
i do live in a larger city in my country
I'd say in Denmark it depends on the city
I grew up a place where the busses only came twice an hour, and we were quite far from the city center, so if I'd stayed there, I'd likely need one (my older brother stayed and got a car the minute he could afford to)
However, I now live in Copenhagen and here you can go your whole life without getting a car, or even a driver's license
There's a bus stop two minutes from my apartment with a bus that comes every 5 minutes and a newly implemented line that shows every 3 or so
I'm 7 minutes from the nearest city-train station, where trains to all over the city and city around it, comes every 5 minutes
And as of a few weeks ago, I'm 15 minutes from the new metro line, which gives me easy access to everywhere in Copenhagen
You have to run in front of a car with a flag, to Warn people of it coming
as a driver, you ALWAYS have to stop at a crosswalk

It’s illegal to refuse to give someone a glass of water if they show up to your door and ask you for it

Its a redudant law
And these tend to stay in the law books in Denmark
So there are a few Odd laws that over time have been replaced with others but they stay because they were the basis for the later more modern laws
Wooops
Welp
The Balkans are like Scandinavia - it is a geopolitical region, meaning that geography matters, but ultimately, the question of who is and isn't is more a matter of culture
The viking era is pretty blurry because Vikings fucking sucked at writing anything down
A lot of the “evidence” are from the Christian crusaders, especially descriptions of Norse mythology
In my city there is a castle from 1600s with crown jewels in the basement
It says a lot about the kings power and lifestyle
The same king also built the old stock exchange and a big observatorium
There are old houses from 1600-1800s still used as apartments, the building i live in is from 1801
This tells us something about how the rich and poor lived
On many houses they have hung up a sign if a famous/influential person lived there
There are still remants of the old city wall/fortress tells us something about how the city has grown, wars, our enemies, military history, kings
Theres a very overlooked ruin of a tower part of medieval fortification in the middle of busy intersection
There are old warehouses at the habor where they would store imports, among other sugar and tobacco from terroritories in the west indies which tells us something about slave trade, international trade etc
Also beautiful houses of those who profitted from this can be found around the city
On several occasions they had to stop the digging for the metro because they stumbled upon new artificats
In Jutland you have a lot of remains of the the old bunkers the Germans built as part of the Atlantic Wall during WW2
There is also the most important stones of all the Jellinge stones from the 10th century which in viking runes tells the story of how Denmark became a nation and how we went from Pagans to Christians
I've been watching all the old Time Team episodes lately, and it had never previously occurred to me that the Romans were in Britain for 400 years
I had somehow got the impression that it was a century of occupation, tops
Watching the programme, it seems like every field in the UK is chock-a-block with Samian ware and tesserae
I’ve not heard of this
Europe is so densely populated (746 million vs 328 million) and with much less wilderness than the US
There’s not really any true undisturbed wilderness in Denmark
But there are buildings from 1500, 1600 that are still being used for apartments, stores and other utilitarian purposes
Also a few from 1400
It’s kind of normal to me in my own city, but in other cities and countries I’m in awe
Sounds like the west coast of Jutland
Bunkers everywhere
(ETA: I took [this] picture at the beach a couple of years ago
Yeah, I've been actively avoiding the newest series
Besides, in the really old episodes, you get to hear Tony carefully explain to viewers what GPS is
Endearing, yet hilarious
It's a fantastic show, definitely
I have a Rejsekort (literally "travel card", which I hold up against a chip reader when I board or exit a train or bus
It automatically calculates the price when I scan it while exiting the vehicle
The Rejsekort has an account that I can deposit money into online, via an app, or via machines or even clerks at most train stations
Rejsekort (travel card) or by mobile, i usually use the mobile
I don't think cash is accepted anymore, and I never carry cash anyway
I'm a student, so unlike the other Danes in here (that I've seen) I don't use Rejsekort
For students like me, there's an option called Ungdomskort, which allows you to travel for "free" everywhere within zone 1 to zone 99 (so basically all of Zealand), if you pay around 650kr per month, and then you also get cheaper tickets for the rest of the country
Some students elect not to have it, because maybe they aren't at Uni very often, or in general, don't use public transport
But for me it's perfect
Especially because of the money I save on other tickets, since my parents live in another part of the country
You can also buy a ticket for cash on the bus/train station, or via app
I just want to make it clear that isn't available all over the country
Some of us are forced to still use paper tickets (Klippekort kan rende mig i røven)
When I'm in London I usually just tap my bank card, and I think there's this daily top up or something so I don't get charged over a certain amount
SMS
Please elaborate aha
Do you mean the rejsekort scanners at Hyllie, Triangeln and Malmø C?
With rejsekort you get a discount for traveling outside rush hour
That is maybe what you are referring to
Where isn't it available
Except for Northern Jutland and Bornholm, I have been pretty much all over the country with my rejsekort the last couple of years
If your journey is done, you tap the card against the checkout reader
If you're going on another bus or train, you don't check out, you just check in  on the other bus (so the system knows you have changed bus)
Normal tickets are about twice as expensive
30 day tickets are a little cheaper, but only if you have to commute almost every weekday for those 30 days
Those two places mainly, yeah
That sounds interesting, but at the same time slightly complicated
Also, that is so fucking cheap wth
Here I think the cheapest fare(like in town) is like €2
In Denmark we usually say smil (smile) or appelsin (orange fruit)
Kamelpis (camel piss) is sometimes said to make the subjects laugh, but it's generally not used with small kids
Appelsiiin (Appelsin - Orange)
The "siiin" at the end seals the deal
In Denmark, most people would just say the Danish word for "smile" which is quite serendipitous
That or appelsin (oranges)
Yeah, Denmark too
Don't confuse us with the Dutch
That happens all the time
And for the love of god, don't ask if Denmark is in Sweden
[Oh yeah you’re socialist, right
I find the “utopia” ones flattering but also a bit annoying
And you know, wrong
I’ve seen people legitimately shocked that we still have murders, bad parts of town, people losing their jobs, people struggling with the system, homelessness
I guess the "Do you have a knife on you
" question must be one of worst ones
Yeah
sorry about all those stupid Danish teenagers going there to party and make a mess
I would be much more interested in going to Uherský Brod and visit the CZ factory
As a Dane I will still get "Peter Schmeichel" and "Brian / Michael Laudrup" when traveling
We really need to start upping our game
Laudrup
Schmeichel
Eriksen
The footballer callout is the worst
Why i oughta
TIL Dutch people are Lamas
Yes, but the Dutch shares this weird "potato in mouth"-ish speech pattern with us
One of the first time I was in the Netherlands I could never tell Dutch and Danish speech apart on distance
Yes
Which is understandable to some extent
Both share weird distinct speech, both are flat, both are famous for windmills (wind turbines for Denmark), both have bikes everywhere, and both are kingdoms as well
I'm sure you can draw even more comparisons
Tbf i've only experienced it with Americans and one English lady
A lot of Americans though
Good one
I remember at some point Finland used to be the butt of all jokes along with Sweden in Denmark, but now it's just Sweden
Wow
Easy now
There's no need to take it that far
You have so much to live for
Fun fact: Some Danes and Dutch share the same English accent
I've experienced this weird anomaly a few times
Once online I fully thought the guy I was speaking to was Danish because of his accent, turned out he was Dutch
I think our poor Belgian friend must have hit his head
There is a reason you have never heard anyone say Swedish was nice sounding :P
Since both the Danish, Finnish and Norwegians all seem to hate you guys
have you ever asked yourself this question
Okay, I admit that skånska sounds ok I guess
And can't we agree that Dutch is the worst
The chance that someone joins is not low (there’s a good chance)
What are you talking about
Danes are the nicest people in the world
Extremely cool and down to earth, while also being back to back world champions in the best sport on the planet (handball, which we incidentally invented)
Oh, and very humble as well, you won't find anyone as modest as us :-)
Here in Denmark a luxury hotel for dogs has recently opened
It offers spa and massage for dogs
The fascist in both Spain and Denmark did not got enough votes for representation i parliament in the recent elections
Today Bulgaria wasnt overrun by the lizard people
Not this shit again
Oldest flag in the world
Largest producer of high quality boar semen
Largest producer of insulin (pretty good quality, too)
The World's oldest amusement parc is just north of Copenhagen
(Bakken)
The World's second amusement parc is Tivoli in Copenhagen
The first ministry dedicated to the Environment was Danish
The first existentialist was Søren Kirkegaard
Same-sex partnership (civil union) became legal in 1989 as the first of its kind of law

We don't produce them here
Way too expensive
Many danish designed bikes are produced in Taiwan
I'd finally be able to speak properly
Fuck
Yeah, no
There's nothing else to eat
We eat them about every day
Everything would fall into anarchy within 24 hours and suicide rates would skyrocket
I think i'll be fine
I'll go with various kinds of other roots
is there potatoes in Döner
i've only heard about it in kebab/Döner boxes
Fuck you're right
But like this we have our secret language even we don't understand xx
Anything where a danish team is remotely close to winning
It rarely gets violent, but people go absolutely nuts over the most ridiculus sports they didn't even know existed
Mostly Handball, but that's only because we are world champions, and really good at it
Football is unique as it’s fan culture historically is so rooted in working class culture not only for entertainment but also as an emotional outlet
I cannot think of any other sport that has the ability to attract the scum of society in such large amounts as football
Can confirm
If a Dane is winning, I am a fan
It's always a good move to invent your own game when you are failling at everything else
Curling
'nuff said
I agree
Although I remember back in the 00s when Team Saxo Bank was one of the mastodonts of cycling and Danes were worshipping Bjarne Riis and the Schleck brothers
Until those greedy brothers decided to join the rival
We'd probably just try to get attention lmao
Until the beer and snaps arrives
I’m with norway on this one
-Denmark
We'd probably just drink too much beer at once, puke and then collapse
Is there a reference I’m missing here
And real life
when i was in school, all i ever heard about was WW2
WW2, is of course interesting
but we never heard about WW1, what caused WW1, and how it relates to WW2
And we also never heard anything about the vikings and the wars between denmark and sweden, and so on
kinda weird
I think I'd like to have learned the truth about Denmarks role as a slavenation
We basically learned that we had the west indies but I clearly remember it describe like we were "the good guys" and it was more a "cooperation", and then our "great king" made slavery illegal as the first country in the world
We weren't taught about that we treated our slaves just like any other slave nation, we were horrible and racist
Even once the "buying of slaves" were made illegal in 1792, it was still legal for 9 more years, and you could keep the slaves until 1848
This story is not at all like the one we heard in school ( let alone how the 10 year grace-period, made it a trend to mainly buy pregnant women and/or rape slave women, so you'd get "two generations out of one slave".)
Luckily its becoming a more common discourse in the public sphere atm, but two years ago when I was a temp at a local school, they were still using the book that taught us the "false story"
I never learned about the danish gold age, where everything sounded very idyllic and romantic, but where the danish state was essentially a brutal police state controlled by an autocratic monarch
an example is in our national anthem: part of it compares the king at the time (frederik the 6th) to a fictional hero of peace, but in reality his time of reign was full of some of Denmarks worst catastrophes (the english wars, state bankruptcy, the loss of Norway)
Vikings and not Columbus discovered 'Murica
That seems odd, I was taught all of those things and more, even before secondary school (gym)
WW2 we maybe spent half a year on in seventh grade, and then it was also mentioned here and there - but in general, we covered everything from Vikings to the fall of The Wall, and everything in between
This seemed to be the general thing both when I went to secondary with kids from different primary schools, as well as now that I study history at uni - we all basically were taught the same things in primary and secondary
Maybe it's just what you remember
I remember a lot about vikings,  the middle ages, a lot of reformation stuff, serfdom and the absolute monarchy and later industrialization and democracy, and Slevig/Holsten and modern history
WW1 is not as heavily taught in Denmark because of our neutrality I guess
EDIT: I would have liked to have learned more about the Thirty Years War
A monumental era in European history and an important part in the decline of DK as a European power
I've learned some stuff about vikings, a lot about ww2 and nothing about ww1
I took a year of history in sixth form in the UK and we also learned about the reformation in Europe (Martin Luther), in relation to the UKs split from the Roman Church with Henry the 8th
&#x200B;
(That being said I was surprised at how your history subject functioned
We had 2x2 lessons per week, one of the days dedicated to English monarchs and one to WW2
This was the entire year, very different from how we do it in Denmark)
hmm that's weird
We learned a lot about how we mistreated  them
Our teacher didn't teach much tho so we got some pages and then googled the rest
Odd, I'm taking my masters in history now and it's something thats discussed a lot in the topic, that we until recently didn't tell the truth to the broader public
It's mainly used as an example of bad sources leads to wrong history
Most of us here though, did go to school in the early 90s and early 00s though, I'm aware that we've gotten better at telling the story within the last 10ish years :)
ah yes, a man that both Norwegians and Danes can agree is great (not so sure about Sweden tho)
I'm aware, since I did choose to take it myself when I was on exchange ;)
My qualms aren't with the system or the structure (we also only had four history lessons during the week in our sixth form level in Denmark, though it was obligatory to take it for all 3 years we have sixth form, though sixth form sisn't obligatory in itself)
My surprise stemmed from the fact that you only covered to topics a year (and as far as I know continued with the same next year)
We'd normally cover between 6-8 topics per year in Denmark, sometimes more depending on the topic
I feel like thats a better approach
I'm unaware of school systems outside the Italian, German, Danish and UK, but all have around the same amount of compulsory education
Ours stop at around 15/16, same with German and Italy
Then you go to our version of Sixth Form if you want to - in the Danish, we might cover more events, but our history subject from around year 7, has an analytical approach (can't say with Germany and Italy, though)
So all in all, there are many broad similarities - it's in the details we differ
I'm aware I'm limited to my experiences with my school in the UK - however, I also have anecdotes from other exchange students that attended different schools in the area, one of which was a 14-year-old German girl attending primary, who told the group that she never did her homework because they only covered WW2 and her being German, well, they didn't exactly tell her anything new
That sentiment seemed to resonate amongst the other western European exchanges, no matter if they were in secondary or not
(My sixth form was also attached to a primary, and when we started (me and a different German girl, who dropped the class after a month because she learned nothing new from it), we were called to a meeting with our history teachers who explained their subjects would mainly be a continuation of what the had taught the student when they went to primary, as most had been here since they started primary, that being WW2 and the UK royal families)
None of what you describe above (analytical skills, wider political implications, ect
) was taught to us in the UK, the Luther reformation was mentioned because the teacher made the connection because I and the German girl was in the class (and the rest of the class assumed this Martin Luther was Martin Luther King, so we ended up spending some time on it)
We simply had two teachers standing at a board, telling us about historical events pertaining to their chosen event/subject matter
I might have drawn the short straw and attended a shitty school - who's to say
But as I mentioned, this was a subject we discussed amongst our group of exchange students attending schools in the city, and my school was not seen as an outlier
Maybe it's changed, it is after all about 9 years since I attended sixth form in the UK, but back then, in those schools, this was the reality
Ours is as well, but we switch up the subjects so we learn the history, while also learning analytical skills :)
That being said, maybe my school was shitty because we had zero focus on analytical skills
I basically just went into a room on mondays and listened for two hours to man talk about WW2, and then another room on thursday to listen to a woman talk about monarchs for two hours
Once in a while they'd show us a film, but other than that nothing else
The Crown but with the Danish Royal Family
Pilou Asbæk should play Prince Henrik
I’d like to see a show like Supernatural, but where they hunt mythical creatures all over Europe - not just Denmark
There’s plenty of folklore to draw inspiration from after all
Actually, it's the other way around
Survivor started getting developed in the UK in 1992 by Charlie Parson, it just wasn't ever aired
And then the concept was bought by STV and it aired in Sweden in 1997
They focus a lot on mythical creatures and folklore in the earlier seasons, and even though the show is pretty cheesy at times, it leans into it and becomes pretty meta which is great imo - if you don’t mind a bit if cheese it’s great
I don't know about the rape, but you're sweden, so that automatically makes you a hellhole
What % though
In Denmark autumn is the only season
Some people also have the misconception that denmark is a winter wonderland

>Bulgaria is 10% comprised of gypsies who will steal your TV
-AndyPhoenix
Само жеговамсе, българиа е хобово.
Wait, is that the amount of the Bulgarian population comprised of Gypsies who steal TVs, or just Gypsies in general
the european union stands as number one in pharmaceutical export, with 51,2%. the US is country number two with a world market share of 11%.
Rocket enthusiast and submarine builder Peter Madsen is up there
Took a Swedish journalist for a ride in his submarine, only to [murder her and cut her to pieces] before dumping the body parts in the ocean and denying knowing anything about her disappearance
Seems a bit silly, prostitution should be legal and so
This only increases my respect for the Irish
He did indeed
If I remember correctly he had threatened a guard with a vest that looked like a bomb, only to be caught within 10 minutes
A very young danish girl did what twats always do
She wrote to him in prison, they became “great friends”, she had a rocket and his signature tattooed on her arm and whined in public about how her family didnt want shit to do with her after finding out
Few years later shes back in the public eye being all “i was so young and dumb”
And how stupid is that
If a woman wants to sell sex, why should anyone be against that
There was also disgusting things like "woman torture" and stuff like that in his search history
I know her personally
Camilla Kürstein
She was always pretty weird
Same
Regulation is the way
Kind of the same for me
However, the eyeopener was when I watched the music video for the first time lol
It is a thing, I was send to I think two in my entire childhood, but I wouldn’t call it a tradition
Our summer vacation is only six weeks long so it isn’t really needed
Every summer vacation we were handed this magazine with activities in our municipality, though
A few were camps but most were “come and paint for a day with some random adult that *might* be a teacher”.
My stepbothers (a couple of years younger than me) were sent to summer camps a couple of times in the 90s
it's not super common these days i think
But they still exist
they're not entirely like in the american movies though
They are usually just sports activities and such
I wouldn't call it tradition but it does exist
I was on several as a kid in end 90's and start 2000s
It varies a lot for me personally because I have some problems with tooth that I really slow and have to get x-rays done 3-5 times a year
But the average seems to be 2 checkups every year
Here in Denmark we often (always
) use a "traffic light" system that determines how often you need a checkup
Green = 1/yr, Yellow = 2/yr, Red = 3/yr, depending on the condition of your teeth
If the checkup reveals issues, you will have to schedule an additional visit
One thing to consider, is that dentist visits are 100% subsidized until you are 18 years where after you have to pay yourself
I know a lot of  people end up skipping these checkups and only visit the dentist when they have problems with their teeth
>My dentist sends me an SMS when a year has passed, and generally I can call and get an appointment for the next week (this year it was a longer wait as Corona caused dentist offices to close for months)
My dentist sends an SMS with the appointment already set
I have to call/SMS/Mail them if I want to set another time, but I have a flexible schedule, so I just let them book whatever time they like
I just wish they'd send a calendar invitation along, so I wouldn't have to type it in myself, but that's just me being lazy
It's the opposite
I would be surprised by anyone from another country being taught anything about Danish history at all
Well i dont know if other nations teach this but my own teachers never actually went over the viking era, or that Denmark rulled a huge part of England at some point
I bareley even know anything about Danelaw and the conqouring of large parts of Britain, and I'm Danish
About the HRE part i never heard about that in my school, i first learnt about it on yt
Well in Denmark you *mostly* don't need to calculate taxes so for that part out isn't so weird we aren't taught it
University history student here
The only aspects of Danish history I have heard mentioned are the Viking Age, The Kalmar Union, our role in the 30 Years War, though that may only be because we have a phase of it named after us, and the Great Northern War
That is still neglecting about 1100/1000 years of history
Here in Denmark we have to learn about Shakespeare if we take high school English at the highest level
I haven’t heard anything about the magna carta in school
I still know what it is, but that’s because I’m a nerd
I mean, of course since your history is so intertwined with ours
It's the same in Sweden, Norway and Iceland
I should add the caveat "countries that haven't at one point been part of the same country as Denmark".
I'm just happy to hear that you are taught that the danes also were vikings
> Well we learn a bit about you here, but I think it's mostly due to the fact that our historys are kinda related
Again, for roughly 500 years, Icelandic and Danish history was two sides of the same coin
>and we also learn Danish though it's widely considered one of the most boring subjects among students
But very useful, in case you want to go study in another Nordic country, which quite a few people do
Uhm
I don't think so
I, at least, didn't learn any Shakespeare in HTX
Depends on the teacher I think
My mother teaches english and she says Hamlet is a bit too long
She teaches Macbeth a lot
Romeo and Juliet also seems to be popular
Oh right, sorry
I’m at STX
I kinda forgot about HTX and all the rest
That much is clear ;) Finland isn't Scandinavian for starters
Vatican city and monaco are smaller
I have no idea, i find it kinda silly really haha
Vastly depends on which non-eu county
Danes are fairly sceptic
Not particularly friendly at all
I would say immigrants have a hard time integrating into Danish society, and even if they do, natives will never view immigrants as belonging in Danish society
To take it a step further, if one of your parents is Danish and the other one is say, Japanese or Ghanaian, but you were born and raised in Denmark with Danish citizenship, a lot of Danes will still not consider you 'one of us'.
If, however, the other parent is French or Austrian, there are usually no questions asked
Fine as long as they are not spreading Trump propaganda ;)
Got several american friends living here
Yeah, my father is Danish and my mother is not, and I’ve been explicitly told many times “don’t try to think you are Danish, because you aren’t”
Not at all
It's very racist
That's not a debate you even want to start, believe me
Oh, you, too
Fun, isn't it
Yes that is true
In general Danes are polite people but not very open
So it takes a lot to make a real danish friend
I myself is in a relationship with an expat and her main social circle is other expats, however there's a big community of internationals
Over at r/Denmark, a question like yours is very common
If you don't study with people, then the most common way to get friends is through work or joining something related to a hobby
This is true
I have a friend whose grandmother is Polish (so he has basically no relations to Poland at all), and he still gets called a Polak
I think you mean orthodox easter
The first of may is a holiday in most social-democratic, SF or Ø municipalities, but no it doesn’t transfer
It's not really common to know about Greece being orthodox unless you have been there
I would say most people knows Russia is orthodox, and of course Italy being catholic because of the pope and Vatican in Rome
Also Ireland and Spain are known to be catholic
I've visited south Italy (where it's close to Albania), and Scandinavia/Nordics are also very exotic to them
Usually shower every 2
day but alot of people shower every day and some shower less often
I take a shower, once every morning, every day
Now that I don't bike to school every day and therefore aren't getting sweaty, I shower every 4-5th day or when my hair feels dirty
I obviously still wash myself morning and evening, but I will only shower when my hair feels dirty
I shower every morning
I think that is the general consensus to shower once a day and then it is different from person to person wether they shower in the morning or in the evening
I think they mean that people sweat way more in warmer climates, and yeah I can see why you might wanna shower more often then
Even in Denmark I can totally feel the (pretty mild) difference between winter and summer
You are not weird
I sweat very little, and nobody notices if I skip a day or even two
Why in the name of Maria Teresa García Ramírez de Arroyo would you do that
That is an atrocity
We have never used anything else than a pizza cutter
yeah, I learned it from a friend, I have been these last 14 years
Copenhagen - typical capital stereotypes, elitist, ignorant, snobbish
Lolland - drug addiction, petty crime, post-industrial depression
Not very lol
Randers - trashy but in a more light-hearted way than Lolland
Nordsjælland - very rich people, snobbish
Sønderjylland - incest, Alabama-ish
But I’ve basically only heard it online
Fyn - as the middle island it’s just a road bump
Edit: Jylland in general - country people who hate Copenhagen with a burning passion
They like to view themselves as more down to Earth, but as a capital snob, I’m not so sure
We have almost the same in Denmark, in that everyone makes fun of the Copenhageners for being upthight and fancy, but somehow still socialist hippies
While they make fun of the rest of us by saying we're poor, incest loving, farmers
Has the Copenhageners finally realized, Jylland is the better place to be, or have they just forgotten about us
Jeg vil sige at Limfjordsregionen ude omkring Mors og Thisted er Danmarks Alabama
Også selvom det er noget nemmere at forstå hvad de siger
Being from Randers I can't say I've ever found the jokes about Randers more lighthearted than about Lolland  In fact for those 8 years I lived in Copenhagen I've met more people who actually believed all the jokes were true, than I've met people who joked about it lighthearted
It is danish yes
From Zealand
Some are making fun of Funen for just being a highway connecting Jutland and Zealand
I've never heard people make fun of Copenhageners being socialist hippies
In my expirence (being from Jylland, but having lived in Copenhagen for 8 years)
People say people from Copenhagen is mostly CBS people and banditter i habitter
Oh don’t worry we have a lot of jokes about you too
Just added one
What I find even funnier is people from Jylland thinking the entirety of Sjælland is Copenhagen
You’re right
In this case, it was because I only saw it popping up after those Alabama memes became popular
People do tend to forget about it, yes
Source: I forgot about it until I read your comment
Bornholm is mostly remembered as a tourist-spot
The notion that people actually *live* there, permanently, is a fact quite readily forgotten
"Old people actually interesting nature funny accent"
I’m sad to hear that
People can be so insensitive
“It was just one joke what’s the big deal” yeah, but if you hear them over and over again
Connecting Jutland and Sweden* ;)
Alle andre er socialist hippier når man Vestjyde
Yeah, I think the divide between rural and urban is pretty universal
Kildare is relatively close to Dublin, so you have the same kind of steriotypes about people from somewhere like Desmond
nono, we dont think that, we know sjæland is bigger
we just realize the whole thing about being from sjælland is a complete paralel to being from Jylland
we dont talk just to talk so often you guys do, as an example
over here everything is just way more down to earth
its some kinda culture to be somewhat proud to be from Jylland
if Denmark split in half, im sure it would be Jylland and Fyn vs Sjælland and the island
all in all its brotherly love
Literally did not go a week without hearing a Randers joke for all 8 years I lived there
By the end I had to frankly sit down with my friends and tell them that not only was I tried of all the jokes, it hurt my feelings since it seemed like they actually meant it when they said I was a lower-class criminal who only drank mokai
I've literally had people tell me how "different I was from all other people from Randers" and how "they were so surprised when they met me, since they thought I would be like the rest of the people from the town". Nevermind that Randers is consistently one of the cities in Denmark with the lowest amount of criminals per citizen, and the most middle class populace
I've had friends visit me in Randers and go: "omg it's actually a city" or "where are all the bums and crime
". Honestly in the end I stopped telling people where I came from, it got so bad
Zealand is the english spelling
In danish it's called Sjælland, which I can't really think of an obvious connection between those two forms
Maybe the answer lies in old norse
In modern danish the direct translation would be 'soul land'.
Måske, mit eneste tilhørte forhold til vest Jylland er mine bedsteforældre, der begge var socialister
Men det er i hvert fald ikke en stereotyp i Østjylland
Og jeg har heller ikke hørt den fra mine venner fra andre dele af Jylland, men det er naturligvis ikke ens betydning med at dem fra vest Jylland ikke har den stereotyp
Det var mere fordi du skrev 'everybody', og det var ikke lige noget jeg genkendte
Down to earth how
And it's interesting the "talk just to talk" thing, I saw that more in a small town in Jylland
If you mean smalltalk on the street, that is
I guess it's mostly just a small town vs city thing
Jeg er nordvest jyde
Næsten alle jeg kender gør det, men jeg tror egentlig mest det er fordi vi er lidt sure over at de har så mange penge derovre
I appreciate you taking the time to reply
Have a good day now :)
like everything is more rooted in reality
but i depends where you are ofc
small talk mainly, but i feel like copenhageners talk and talk and talk, when sometimes its okay to just be quiet
that is of course if said persons are friends, i dont think people just talk randomly to random people
uanset hvad, så er det selvfølgelig kun smag og behag
Do those movies feature trolls
>I think that the two cities would have been called the same
Copenhagen and Malmø together with the regions of Zealand, Scania and Halland have indeed today joined in the Greater Copenhagen metropolitan cooperation (previously known as the Øresund region)
Having been to Rome, Venice and Florence, going to Milan was a weird surprise
It felt much more Northern European, more specifically German, which would make sense
It was really nice though, this mix of Central European and Italian
Love that city
>Köpenhagen
Is that how you write Copenhagen/København in Finland
Halland has been part of Greater Copenhagen the past two years and Blekinge is expected to join soon
Hello fellow Copenhagener :P

Yes we have, here are some of the transitions:

Anne = Anna
Nicholas = Nikolaj
George = Georg
Philppe = Filip
Mary = Maria

First time i ever saw Furries in Fursuits outside in real life was when i was in Moscow
I thought that was funny because Furries are usually stereotyped as the members all being homosexuals (Not that i'm saying that's true)
But i didn't see anyone discriminating them
When i Said “YOU” i was refering to the belgian person, not BELGIUM

Some parts of russia probably are very hellish
Small villages in siberia sometimes look like they’re 3rd world
That is true
On the European side of the Ural Mountains
Russia looks very modernised
And the large cities (St

I didn’t know that
Lol
From my experience it was as i told
Perhaps i should experience russia some more
Bringing in cake and/or pastries when it's your birthday is standard
My boss also recently got married and brought in a cake
On Fridays, people get together and have a couple of beers or a gin & tonic after hours
Recently, different people have started bringing in cakes or other treats to share with everyone just as something nice for the team
Probably not strictly COVID compliant, but we're pretty good about hand washing/sanitizing, wearing masks, etc
On the non-cake or food side, I have yet to see anyone bring in a card for everyone to sign, but one colleague got a small flowering plant for her office when she came back from maternity leave
Oh yes, cake for any occasion
We also have friday bread, taking turns bringing in rundstykker (rolls) and such, for an informal meeting in the morning
Danish sounds horrible in most metal music, and therefore you won't find any metal sung in Danish that isn't underground, and therefore I'm gonna throw a curveball, because you need to have Al Namrood - Xenophobia in your playlist
The only band that sings metal in Arabic and they include traditional sounds as well
Christian the 7th was litterally insane
So properly him
I came to write exactly this
He is notorious for just how insane he was
He succeeded his father, Frederick the V., who was a drunkard and had been neglectful of his duties himself
That left the court to be dominated by power struggles between the councillors who wanted to rule instead of the king
Christian was himself caught in this, as a child through the brutal upbringing by his noble tutor which only worsened his condition, and after he succeeded his father at the age of 17
He tried to govern in the beginning and was described as intelligent but immature and full of temperament
Being easily manipulated and having no grasp of his duties and the power struggles around him, he gave up on his duties
He would go into Copenhagen with his prostitute lover Støvlet-Katrine ('Bootie-Cathrine') and drink at the seedy pubs and brothels until the early morning
He would brawl with the local police force and come home in the morning with insignia and trinkets taken from the police force
There are also stories of him leapfrogging over foreign dignitaries, when they bowed to him
It's hilarious to read about, but it's really tragic at the same time
The Danish state was an absolute monarchy at the time, which meant he couldn't be declared insane and thus was forced to stay in power to keep up the power balance of the state and the court
Damn, I never heard about the masturbation part :/
Ludwig was not mad
He was declared mad by some of the nobles because they didn’t like how much money he was spending on fairy-tale castles
Which isn’t exactly smart, but he was as sane as anyone
He was primarily king of Belgium/King of Belgians or how they title themselves
The fact that he personally acquired Congo didn't change that
Hence "Wir wollen unseren alten Kaiser Wilhelm wieder haben"
> but in the shortest possible time to put the backward agrarian country on the rails of industrialization
By starving the people in Ukraine
Also, Russia was expected to industrialise rapidly by just about everybody dealing with global politics back around the turn of the last century
The fact that Russia would become an unbeatable industrial superpower in the very near future, was one of the primary reasons that Germany was so hooked on going to war in 1914, because they saw it as a now-or-never moment
I don't think Stalin deserves that much credit for it
> ...and in all of the rest republics
Ukraine was by far the hardest affected region, which to my knowledge, was also the only region, where the borders were shut, meaning the starving peasants were not allowed to flee
I remind you this happened in what is probably the most fertile agricultural region on earth, and one of the reasons for it happening was extremely tough quotas, that often didn't leave the farmers with enough seeds to both feed themselves, and plant enough crops for next year
>Some of these crimes were neccessary for progress of young countries
Miss me with that genocide apologia
If you try to alleviate a starvation, why do you restrict movement out of the affected territory
>But Ukrainian propaganda loves to use golodomor as an act of genocide by evil Russians
Because it was just totally a very convenient mismanagement of the territory with the 2nd biggest ethnic group, which weren't exactly positive about Moscow rule, that just happened to severely gimp said ethnic group
You can extend this to Kazakhstan as well, the famine was a move to quell dissidents among the Kazakhs
Crazy story
what a life
There’s no direct meaningful translation of “thank you” from Danish
We literally just say `tak` which means “thanks”.
Some might argue that `tak skal du/I have`, directly translated meaning “thank shall you(singularis)/you(pluralis) have”, would be it
But nah
tak - singular
takker - plural
> India
but don't india use shitty old planes from the 60s or something
I dont recall the model
but i read some news about an indian pilot out-flying a MIG and shot it down (during this indian vs pakistan thing earlier this year (or was it late 2018
they mentioned the jet the indian guy flew with and i googled it
didn't look like the MIG 21
it had a weirder nose
and iirc it was from the 60s (i guess it was newsworthy because the jet he used was inferior to the MIG he shot down)
i was wrong
it was a mig 21
he shot down a  F16 (while also getting shot
(article in danish, but im sure you can find a web translator)
I always carry these 4 things with me everywhere I go: Phone, keys, pocket knife and my wallet with credit cards, emergency cash, drivers license, organ donor registration, misc membership cards and stuff like that
Other than that, things that are important to me includes:
My laptop
Rye bread (and Danish liver pate with bacon
My guns (sports shooting is a very fun hobby)
Some family heirlooms, especially some wooden furniture and boxes that my deceased grandfather who was a very talented woodworker made
Pepsi Max
I know, it's not healthy, but I don't smoke, rarely drink alcohol or other unhealthy stuff
But I need my Pepsi Max
I don't use mine very often, but I am pretty sure everyone I know has one somewhere in their kitchen cabinets
Fingerspitzgegühl, scheize, zugzwang, spitzenkandidat
Danish is a northen Germanic language, so
We Danes have the tradition of borrowing indiscriminately from other languages
Just see the English influence on Danish over the last 70 years
And we borrowed as indiscriminately from German for almost a thousand years
Depending on the type of text anywhere from 10-30 (in certain cases even 45)% of the words will be from German origin
Almost all words associated with the crafts (håndværk) are German words for instance
On the other hand
Before High German was introduced/enforced/suggested all the way to the border one could say there was an unbroken language-continuum between Danish and German
Dansk, Jysk, Sønderjysk, Sydslesvigsk, Platte, Tysk
In such a continuum, when is it exactly a loan
I looked it up, and thought it to be some sort of ham(because of schinke), and then I saw it was basically just a weird German way of saying "placintă".
Not that commen, but still something you see now and then
Nobody cares
On some men long hair looks really nice
I think we are 3 in my class of 10 boys with long hair (including me)
It's not too uncommon and isn't viewed negatively (I hope lol)

Je t'aime, one of the best love songs ever
Titanium was huge, and I think it might become a classic
DANCE and We are your friends by Justice were enormous hits in Europe
Oxygene (part IV) was groundbreaking in the 70’s and is instantly recognisable to millions of people

Netherlands in Danish is "Holland" and not just the province
I've noticed that a lot of dutch/belgian people on reddit write 'kopenhagen'. I know it's written that way in dutch
I just wondered why they chose this spelling when writing in english
Ahh ok
Makes sense
Just always wondered since I've only seen it from dutch speaking people
We executed 46 collaborators after the war
It has caused controversy since because death penalty was not a possible verdict untill a law was changed after the war
The controversy came from the fact that the offender's were judged for actions commited before the law was decided
We executed a lot of the more notorious ones, sadly
There’s a movie called “Under the sand” that shows what Danes did with Germans, it’s a pretty good movie in my opinion
> Women who slept with Germans were shaved in public
Also happened in Denmark
Yes, sadly
I do not believe a government should ever have the right to execute its own citizens, regardless of what their crime is
So I think it is sad that the government executed them
It should be noted, that the Danish government stayed in power for some years after the occupation, and actively encouraged the population to "work with the Germans", even to the extend of actively encouraging unemployed workers to take jobs in Germany or otherwise work for them
Government was dissolved in 1943, and the post-war government made an ex post facto law that banned working for the Germans
They basically said: "You should have known we didn't actually mean it when we told you to work for them
It was a dark time for justice in Denmark
Agreed, which I think most Danes would
Likely that's why it's somerhing we don't talk much about
The execution place is rotting away inside Christiania only being conserved by the efforts of historians spending their own time and money on it, because the government refuses to
Even wartime execution powers can be used by a government acting in bad faith to execute dissidents
Opposition to the death penalty should, in my opinion, be absolute, but you have the right to disagree of course
Luckily, Denmark abolished wartime death penalty in 1978
Well most Danes despised the Germans by then because of what they did during the first world war for taking Danish soldiers to fight for them from Slesvig, even though Denmark was neutral during WW1
it's important to note that the war in Denmark, wasn't anything near what it was in Poland
Denmark surrendered after a couple of hours of fighting, and a cooperation government was formed that actively urged the Danes to cooperate with the German occupation soldiers
Also all of this were actually controlled by the danish resistance movement and not state officials, and there are quite a few stories of members getting their revenge on old foes by claiming they were collaborators
It was first in 1993 that it was completly abolished

But y?
Have seen it multiple times, not really that unusual
In the trains (s-tog) it's mostly teens, but adults sometimes also join in
No such thing exists
Well, bokmål is probably the closest we get
As I had understood it, Norway has two languages, Bokmål and Nynorsk, both spoken and written
And I had somehow always thought differently, but TIL
Perhaps the loss of Norway and Schleswig and Holstein
After this Denmark for the first time in several hundred years was definitively no longer a player in European politics
Denmark had to redefine itself as it was now small, homogenous, weak and poor so we unified around everything Danish like the language, vikings, nature in art and literature
I would say it is the loss In the Second Schleswig war, loosing a lot of the best land to Prussiaz
That really changed alot about the identity
I agree, and I would say that the second Slesvig war and specifically the (lost) battle at Dybøl is the quintessential moment of that process
Another example could be when King Harald Bluetooth unified the Danish kingdom and his baptism in ~965
The introduction of Christianity was a pretty big thing, considering how powerfull the church would become in the following 1000 years
Christmas rice porridge
I just don’t like porridge, period
Every Christmas I get the same “WHAT
You don’t even consume the holy *risengrød*?!?!”
I actually love our cuisine in general, despite being a huge food lover
I worded it like that because there is a tendency to stereotype every European cuisine other than France, Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal as horrendous and bland
I pretty vehemently disagree, although I acknowledge that they have had the advantage of having the climate for a bunch of interesting vegetables
Herring, wether it be smoked pickled or fried, throw that fish back into the sea because its garbage
I hate it, too
Even as a kid, I couldn't stand it
I like porridge, just not rice porridge
And butter and cinnemon just make it even more gross
I like Risengrød, but used to hate Risalamande with a burning passion
Then I started making it myself and now it’s S tier (gotta roast the almonds before chopping them up)
Danes only eat it at Xmas - Icelanders eat it all year  Personally I like a good rice pudding (but having it at Xmas is enough)
U really think I would take advice from a Swede
Solid advice - the other day we ran out of whole fat milk so I made it for my son with full fat cream
World, meet Guldrisengrød.
It’s extremely varying what people do on the 23th
Some families have that tradition but certainly not all
People just eat it throughout December
I’m so interested in trying some Balkan food
What would you recommend
In Danish and I think other Scandinavian languages we have the word “grød”, which covers both oatmeal but also things like rice porridge
Basically, grains boiled with water or milk
Don't you have smartphones in Germany

Our [war museum] damn we have had a lot of wars
[M/S Maritime Museum of Denmark] build at an old shipyard, really cool location next to [Kronborg Castle] (Hamlet
“[The old city] see how we lived in the 1970s, 1920s and before 1900 in the city
[Frilandsmuseet] buildings from Denmark through the last 350 years
All I really remember about the Nordic museum is that it had several mistakes about Denmark
I visited back in 2018 with a bunch of my fellow history majors and we ended up being so annoyed at all the mistakes that we filled out a costumer review where we asked them to correct all their mistakes
Do you remember some of them
I remember one that annoyed me was that they claimed we didn't celebrate Lucia Day in Denmark and that we never did
They also had that weird Christian Den Gode lie that I often hear from Swedes
Yeah, they wrote about how we apparently call him "Christian den gode", which we never did  it's a lie fabricated by Swedish historians in the mid 1900s, it's assumed to have been as part of some anti-Denmark sentiment, and for some reason a lot of Swedes (that I have met both IRL and online) actually have been taught it as true in school
There are very few stores in Denmark so i say not very prevalent i counted 10 stores on google maps
On the other hand the one closest to me has been there all my life so guess they do alright
There are only 11, McDonald’s is probably more preferred here
They have plans to open another 25 restaurants
Yes
Dining out is expensive and not something most people can afford on a regular (multiple times a week) basis
We don’t have a restaurant culture like in Southern Europe
The vast majority of people’s meals will need to be cooked by themselves
Cooking is also curriculum in Denmark, I’ve said this on the sub before and France, Spain and Italy freaked out
It was really funny, I feel like those countries would have cooking a part of education if anyone
To know not to boil a steak, fry uncooked pasta and bake salad leaves

Yup, pretty similar I'd say
Weird language as well

I don't know about that
They use those silly colored sprinkles
It's not a proper piece of chocolate
Ah, you're right
I didn't read the question correctly
Still flattered that a Swede said something positive about us lol
I'm sure we're more hilly overall, but our tallest point is 171m, while yours is a staggering 322
4 meters at Vaalserberg
(I was surprised to learn about that)
Dont worry, I think most Danes and Norwegians definitely think of you that way as well
I think Sweden is way closer to Finland in a way we're not
First I got a painter, and was a tad confused

we literally have a far left party who gets almost all their parliament seats from our capitol region since its our largest urban area, I vote for them too but it matters little in my remote rural area where almost nobody votes for them
Some may have a different view but i feel like Copenhagen is a world of its own particularly in the summer when there are tourists
It just feels different in every way
well also them yes, but there are 2 more socialist parties
This is just my interpretation, ok
but here goes; Ventre, centre-right party has had a firm hold on the small-to-medium rural farmers and some industries while the centre-left social democrats are more broadly represented among various regional industries workers, though more concentrated in cities too, though its not uniform across the country and the economic vs social-policies political blocs are more fractured than ever
What with the social democrats not repealing the right-wings tightened asylum and refugee policies
But the hard-left socialists are much more concentrated purely in the capital
our "red bloc" is rather large [List\_of\_political\_parties\_in\_Denmark]
A quick look at election statistics show that the three most left parties got double as many votes from the greater Copenhagen area in 1977 and still does in 2019
I think the Swedish left party as well as your social democrats have had a much bigger base and involvement from the rural areas from the start, whereas the Danish left wing parties have been more dominated by students, academics and workers from the few big industries that were centralised in the biggest cities
Occasionally schools, nursery homes or just families will have one

Making friends with a Finnish border guard after crossing into Finland from Russia
My coworker and I had spent a few weeks in then-soviet Russia, and was happy to get back to "Western Quality" of
well, everything
The guard was going off duty, and joined us the local eatery of the small town on the border (I forgot the name)
**Russia**
Being invited home to dinner with a translator I had worked extensively with over some years, in the mid 90s. His family and I spent the better part of the evening and night eating dinner, drinking tea, and discussing the future of Russia
Later his daughter would end up living here in Denmark, and we still stay in contact
**Poland**
A coworker and I tried to drive through the night to get from somewhere I can't remember to our hotel in Germany
We wound up getting too tired and slept in the car
The following morning we were hungry and bleary eyed, and spotted what looked like an inn, so we went inside to get something to eat
A lot of the locals were hanging around, sipping coffee and idly chatting, and the innkeeper offered us coffee, and asked
something in Polish
We couldn't understand her, and neither she, nor any of the locals could speak anything but Polish
She got the meaning that we were hungry, so she grabbed us by the hands and took us into the kitchen where she opened larders, cupboards, and fridges and expected us to point at what we wanted
In the end we wound up with an awesome breakfast with eggs, bread, butter, milk, and something that looked and tasted kinda like knödlen
I can't remember how much we paid for it, but everyone's friendly curiosity was just so heartwarning

I once set off an explosives detector when I flew into Heathrow airport because I had been on a military explosives course shortly before I had to go to London for work
Practically everything I carried were apparently showing traces of explosives, and I had an actually rather pleasant chat, and a cup of tea, with the security staff while they looked through my luggage and verified my story with (I guess) the Danish Ministry of Defense
All in all that's a story in itself, but what really made it stand out was the fact that the same person who had initially tested my luggage when flying into London was the same person who tested it when flying out again some days later
He had a good guffaw when he noticed me, and while I still had my luggage thoroughly searched, he took the time to calm the obvious nerves of what looked to be his apprentice, and make idle chatter with me

I drove through the country once
The motorway was in good condition, and all of it was lighted through the night

Then slowly sailing home late at night with a sky full of stars and a bright moon to illuminate the way, and my girlfriend snuggling up to me
We split up later that year, but the feeling of tranquility and calm as we made our way back to harbor on a wave-less sea will forever stand out in my mind
Those few hours I realized I was feeling truly happy, and I'll cherish that memory until I die

Visiting with my girlfriend in '92ish and finding a little jazz club, partly hidden in the basement of an apartment building, with the entrance through the yard, and down a set of concrete stairs
The stage was only just large enough for an upright piano, a bass/tenor sax player, and a singer
The beer was good, and the atmosphere was awesome, and the bartender greeted us by name after a few visits

In Denmark; we have had some infamous people from the different biker gangs like Hells Angels and Bandidos
They weren't necessarily famous from the drug trade itself as much as for the violence and shooting, which is very rare in our country
Our most infamous gangs related to drug trade are all imported, like biker gangs literally just local versions the American ones
Drug trafficking is mainly run by biker gangs like Hells Angels and "immigrant" gangs but there is and i believe has never been a drug kingpin the size and scale of anything seen in north or south america where they essentially run entire neighborhoods and areas, pay off police, run international supply chains, bribe politicians, own lavish mansions and apartments, drive around in fancy cars with convoys of armed men and own expensive jewellery
I once had an easter lunch next some very senior Hells Angels, we got there as they were finishing up lunch and then they har like 3 or 4 bottles of snaps brought out
They drank all of them collapsed like dominoes once or twice and were outta there a bit before we were done
10/10 great entertainment
In Denmark Middle Eastern gangs have also become a problem and are pretty much often in war with bikers over territory
So I wonder if in Sweden just like in Denmark, the bikers are seen as “heroes” by white supremacist and so on
I would say the big guys operate internationally (in Europe), which makes things more complicated
Most big cases there have been in the news, have been when police have discovered trucks or containers coming into the country
Also pretty much, depending on where in Denmark, I would either go to a biker related local white guy, a Middle Eastern, or a Eastern European for drugs
So it’s my overall understanding it’s all small fries here
Very unlikely but probably Sønderjylland which was part of Germany until 1920
[Fyn] (Funen in English)
I'm halfway joking, but there was a political party they was called "Befri Fyn" (Liberate Fyn) and most of their agenda was to have Fyn sceded and then tax everyone wanted to use things from Fyn
Like a tax or fee for each time an HC Andersen story was sold
Or a tax when someone eats a specific cake from Fyn
Something along those lines
I guess Greenland doesn't count considering it's not really considered a part of our country, but more so a part of our kingdom
So I would probably say something like Jutland if I have to be honest, but it seems rather extreme
Isn't there a large Russian minority on Svalbard
They could do a Crimea on you
Or Greenland and the Faroe Islands if we count them
Maybe Bornholm becomes independent
Sønderjylland is the most nationalist part of the country
Do you remember the election in 2015
Is Taffel Finnish
Oh my God
I had no clue
It is one of the few brands I have stayed loyal to since childhood

I don't think we would even take it back anymore
Never seen a stray dog in my life here
All dogs are registered and chipped here
government agency you can call will "take care of them" for free
We like being honest with our kids about the meat going into their mouths, its pretty common for young school kids to visit a farm, its also very common for the Zoo's to do that, but us Danes turn it into an educational time for kids about the african plain animals food chain etc
the official reply from the zoo was "taking advice from the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria, it did this to prevent inbreeding as the zoo's giraffe breeding program already has enough animals with similar genes "
Blue for the most part
Although also a decent amount of black
Probably 65/35 blue/black
I’ve heard in Germany kids still have to learn to write with fountain pens
Heard from a left-handed German that she got such bad handwriting grades because of this lol
I can see that but being left-handed, I think I would find that so frustrating
He is technically correct, which is the best kind of correct
I would have thought a German would appreciate that :P
Not really, we do have dialects in Denmark, but we just focus on risdansk, or pure danish
I lived in the Southern part of Jylland my whole childhood, but we were never taught in school how to speak the dialect there, so I never learned it
I can understand some of it though
I find dialects charming
Now I live in the western part of Jylland
And here we also have a bit of a dialect
I can teach you something rather simple I learned here in the west
Here they have a word which is spelled: Hov
(said more like Huw) If you have an accident, this word is more than enough to say: Sorry, my bad, everything wrong, apologies
But all you say is just "Hov
" And it's just like a sound
Took me a while to understand that is enough to just say that here
Denmark
We were taught the differences between the different dialects and accents in a superficial non-technical way
Some very old teachers native to these areas would read aloud from a text in Sønderjysk and Bornholmsk
Unfortunately many are dialects are dying out as the young people tend to converge and sound like they do in capital region
I did have a brief focus on the dialects of Denmark during folkeskole in Danish class
I remember we watched these videos of people reading the same story but in different dialects - like Copenhagens, Thybomål, Alsisk, and Sønderjydsk
But, tbh, it was very brief and we never covered anything like that again
&#x200B;
Also, risdansk gave me a little laugh ;)
But i did have a course in school were we were taught a bit about swedish, icelandic and norwegian
I remember having to read and excerpt of some icelandic saga in original language
Absolutely impossible
It isn't risdansk  that's why it made me laugh a little
Its rigsdansk, which basically means "Kingdom danish"
Ohh
Hahaa that honestly makes more sense
I got no idea why I've always thought it was risdansk
Suppose I had too much Risengrød.
It's like when Pyrus applied to Rigsarkivet, thinking it was a place filled with rice
I miss Pyrus
Such good memories
Me too :( best julekalender we ever had tbh
I still have it on VHS
ham and cheese
salad and vegies preferd but not required
put mayo on it and il
be prety upset
A good flæskestegs sandwich is personally my favourite
That's not proper rye bread
Proper rye bread looks like [this]
I'd argue that our rye bread is simply more sophisticated (and therefore better), than your simple (sorry excuse for) rye bread
One rye bread to rule them all
Blasphemy
There shouldn't be flour on top of the bread
I would actually say our recent election was quite refreshing
How power was handed from the right to the left, where the sitting prime minister insisted on being intirim prime minister, not political
That was so refreshing
Smaller countries tend to be more dependent on other countries and thus better at English which is necessary for me
German is my “3rd” language and not much more;)
So I imagine that Austrians and Swiz ppl are better at English
However, I think Switzerland is quite expensive on many parameters
So Austria it is
Second would probably be Bayern/Baden-W. Germany got cheap cars;) (relative to my flair)
And I love the shape of nature north of the Alps
Slesvig wouldn’t do it for me
I actually don't know
Is it cheating if I say "Germany, but only the parts right next to Denmark"?
Germany, southern Slesvig
Basically nothing would change, depending on the social circles I associated with I could even keep speaking Danish
i'd pick switzerland, but i really dont know why
Switzerland is like the north korea of europe
The high salaries ain’t there for fun
Switzerland ain’t cheap, or am I wrong
i guess i just know almost nothing about the place
and they're rarely, if ever, mentioned in the news where i live
I just checked and prices vary depending on when you wish to travel
But an weekday trip price between the two biggest cities in Denmark with a stop in the third biggest is 30€. The trip takes 2h and 50m.
Quick calculation says its cheaper than car if you are one person, about the same if you're 2 and more expensive if you are three
On weekends the tickets are more pricy and here the breakeven looks to be between 1 and 2 travellers
In some cases I think it's actually more common that locating it in the capital
Don't take my word for it tho
Until recently not coming
Lately our previous government decided to move lots of the essential institutions outside the capital
This is having catastrophic consequences as these areas lack qualified labour and the current experienced employees won't move to the middle of nowhere
It is getting more Common
The last goverment adopted a policy of moving out central administration away from Copenhagen
historically very uncommon, but the government made a move a couple of years back to move a couple of institutions away from copenhagen
Among the most notable was The Danish Language Council (Dansk Sprognævn) and the Environmental Protection Agency (miljøstyrelsen)
Yes, but it was part of a populistic comprimise with the right wing party
Hence, the only argument for doing this was to get more votes from the less populated areas
This populistic compromise is now having significant consequenses
While I do get the reason to do it, my personal opinion is that such drastic measures should have a more solid argument and reason behind it than hunting populistic votes
E.g. lowering unemployment rates in these areas, more qualified employees or even cost saving
This has resulted in neither of these things
"Brev til månen" (Letter to the moon) by Ib Michael was the book that I had the most trouble getting through
It's about a young man in the sixties, who spends most of the book being in love with his best friend's sort of girlfriend
It's written in a very boring and slow way and most of the main characters are not great people
The only part of it that I enjoyed even a little was at the very end where the main character almost dies in a plain crash, but even that is somehow wirtten in a way that takes away all the intensity of the situation
That or Faroese
Knowing absolutely nothing about Swiss gun laws, I'm pretty sure they're infinitely more strict than (the average) American gun laws, so the comparison wouldn't be worth the paper it's written on
Aren't there also strict rules for how you can store weapons
I seem to remember hearing that you must have a safe for weapon storage, which the police can inspect at will to ensure that it's stored correctly
*Wealth* inequality is actually pretty high in Denmark (compared to the rest of Europe), while *income* inequality is the lowest or one of the lowest
Wealth inequality is hard to measure and research
But I think the theory is that very few Danes, compared to other countries, see the need for holding stocks, bonds and savings because welfare
So it runs in very few upper-class families where you inherit and are taught that’s it’s a good thing to have, while the general population just don’t care that much
Denmark
I am quite happy with my disposable income
I am not where real estate is affordable yet, at least not in my city, but i do have plenty for savings and investments
Can relate
Got a good (free) education, good job and more than sufficient income
Never seen a need for investing besides safe investments (as in real estate and bonds) for that very reason
Which is very sad and needs to change
400 DKK is 65 dollars, soooo I think they earn well above that haha
From google: “someone newly educated with a bachelor in software development can except to earn 30
000-35
000 DKK (4872-5684 dollars) a month
You will have the opportunity to become a developmental leader later, earning maybe 50
000 DKK (8120-8932 dollars) a month”.
... before taxes
I’m not quite on the real adult job market yet so I might not be the best to ask
But income tax is close to 50% if you earn more than 544
000 a year, which you do at 43
000 ish a month
Before that threshold it’s still quite high
At 30
000 DKK a month you’ll get about 20
000 (3248 dollars) in your pocket
At 50
000 DKK you’ll get 30
000 in pocket
A school teacher earns about 30
000 DKK a month for reference (again, before taxes)
Eternally growing wealth is happening everywhere, all the time
As long as humans are born and as long as those humans use money, or just want things, it will continue
Saying it is unrealistic is the same as disputing the laws of physics, it's just how things work
There are no negative outcomes when properly investing and it is a great way to raise one's wealth even further, on top of that it is idiotically simple to do and more people really should get into it
It has been growing for over 200 years, some wealthy families have grown for even longer than that
But do you really expect that humanity will just stop
It won't, ever
Not using ad much doesn't mean it will go negative
Only when the solar system is completely depleted, which will take a long time
There are 0 reasons to not invest
As long ad you have any money available for use, there is no reason not to
Yes, but a lot of money doesn't come from nowhere
It is all about those small beginnings, those tiny increments that can set it off
If you give up on investing because "well I won't be a millionaire tomorrow, so what's the point", you won't move one bit economically
And when those small stock investments have payed of you can start dreaming a little bigger, maybe invest in something that isn't stocks, maybe just some bigger stocks
"Nothing comes easy" is wrong, because investing is very easy, "nothing comes fast" is the actual truth
Time in the market matters more than timing
Even if you want to invest in stocks but are scared about individual stocks, you can just throw your money at an index fund at watch it grow over a couple of decades
i just make up new words when that happens, noone notices
I've had this exact same thing happen
Something weirder, is when a word suddenly 'loses meaning', where I cognitively am aware what it means but the word is just this random sounds and lettering
Like a strange disconnect
Happens all the time
I'm not embarrassed in the slightest though, I'm fine with it
I'm a student, it happens to everyone around me as well
I've used English to an extent where it seems natural to get stuck in one of the codes once in a while
To be fair, I dated an English guy for a couple of years and had very close friends in college that were international, so I've used English a lot
Because my closest friends were Danish, half Danish/half Italian and half German/half American, we ended up switching back and forth between Danish and English to a degree that it's completely normal for me to switch back and forth in the middle of a sentence
Good times
I'm a big fan of the Faroese variant of Danish, which is known as Gøtudanskt
I feel like it is the perfect compromise between Danish and Norwegian, and I'm fairly convinced it's the most commonly intelligible language between Danish, Norwegian and Swedish
At least for Danes and Norwegians, some Swedish people will have to weigh in on it, if they understand it better than they understand Norwegian
[I'm just gonna leave this here
&#x200B;
^(take that Sweden
Fuck
Norweigan is like danish but alot more charming
For me it´s Danish, even before I moved here
It just rubs me the right way when I hear it and always made me feel wholesome
It´s just really hard to learn :(
i must say that danish is the most beautiful language in existence
Danish
ITT people being categorically wrong
We have that too, you know :(
Bicycle Buddies Friendship Club = abolished
Yes
I love you
\*edderkop
> Though I have to say that in this interview of Eivør Pálsdóttir she does sound quite interesting
And at least she is understandable :P
But that's because she doesn't speak Norwegian at all, she speaks Gøtudanskt, which is how Danish traditionally was spoken on the Faroes, and which incidentally is named after her hometown Gøta
She does spice it up by saying mye instead of meget, but that might be how it's usually done in Gøtu, as it flows a good bit better than pronouncing meget with a hard g.
Imo Gøtudanskt is without any doubt the most easily understandable Scandinavian language
Yes
But we don't sound that good to others with that dumb potato in our mouth
What's up with the extra k in tak
Oh boy, you are going to get shanked like a grind, if you are implying Gøtudanskt is Faroese
I think the Faroese might you beat you up if you said that to them
I live an area of Copenhagen with more Faroese than Danes and I can honestly say they beat Sweden in how little they like Denmark ;)
Finland Swedish is also pretty easy for me
But Gøtu should be fairly straight forward for Icelanders, it's basically how Danish is taught and spoken in Iceland
... what
Danish has more phonemes than Norwegian, by a fair bit
Hell, I think Danish is the language with the most vowel sounds in the world
You mean letters
I’m pretty sure they have one more than us
Pronounciation
Certainly, a lot of our vocals are pronounced exactly the same
Socialdemokrat
Kælling
Hængerøv
Svenskerhår.
Interplanetære fribytter
Faroese was considered a Danish dialect up until the middle of the 19th century
isn't it that small minority swedish they found in a valley somewhere, that's actually closest
Only choked by you Norway <3
[Relevant webcomic]
At least a contender, I think we have about 30 different or so, and hell even with a lot of the vowel collapse that's going on, we are still going to be up there in the top
Roofs as in *tage*?
How do you say two k's after each other
Don't you swallow the last k?
Personally I think Norwegians say tak and only spell it takk
No I mean grind as in pilot whales
That's actually true
The pitch in Danish depend on the diealect
In a (strong) Copenhagen dialect you'd end up as well
It means [mullet
What if we formed a union at Kalmar
...Unless
Oh good it was a silly fight anyway
But now that our love is reunited, remind me again what his charm was in the first place
Denmark is smaller, but the older country - so geographically I'd say Norway is our daddy, while historically we are theirs
Yes, it's a male name and also a roof
I will thank my roof next time it rains
Tak tag
Takk tak
Thank you for the explanation
Mange tak(k)
I can't find any Danish words that end with a double consonant, so I can't really compare it
If you would thank your roof, would you say:
Takk tak
That actually makes sense, even in Danish where double consonant is also indication of short vowel sound
Vikings are back in town, pick up the bone  we finna be in Vineland in a minute
DR 1, which is the main tv-channel of the public-service Danish Broadcasting Corporation
The "DR" stands for "Danmarks Radio", since the company was orginally created as a public radio broadcasting company
Far from "really annoying" me, this is actually an incredibly tiny thing, but I hear it so persistently that it has started grating on me
For some godforsaken reason, Danes *insist* on trying to pronounce English place-names and brands in the English way, instead of just pronouncing it like a Dane would
Imagine an English news-anchor insisting on pronouncing every French or Hungarian city in the native fashion - it would be really jarring
This is not helped by most Danes having subpar English pronunciation
This is also only the case for English-speaking countries
If we're talking about Greece or India, we're going to pronounce it like a Dane normally would
Since many cities in e.g. America are named after places in Europe, this means that a Danish journalist might pronounce Athens (Greece) differently from Athens (America)
> we say "sister's son" or "brother's daughter" and so on
I mean, if those are a compound word, then that *is* your word for nephews and nieces
That's the way it is in many languages
In Danish, although we have *nevø* and *niece*, *søstersøn*/*brordatter*/etc
is the older way of saying it
Same in English
Denmark is now the 17th Bundesländer and I am guessing we're pretty pissed about it
no no no, we're the dominant ones
germany will become southern denmark and we'll gently overtake all their industry and money
either way, slesvig-holsten returns to their rightful country
I think Scandinavia (or even the Nordic countries) is perhaps the only European region with a real shot of political unification
But it does lead to some fun discussions of which monarch should remain head of state
Agreed, I like and can understand Norwegian (Bokmål) far better than Swedish
Not to mention reading Norwegian is easy as fuck for us Danes

If the rule is closest Capital to yours I would say Denmark would be the one
we will just do like in malaysia with a rotating monarchy
I think a lot of people in Copenhagen has a decent grasp of Swedish since Malmö and Cph are super interconnected
I see so many Swedes here and they are always a cheery bunch and great drinking companions so I certainly wouldn't mind more integration between Scandinavia
Suggest we start speaking Norwegian
It's a fair compromise between pronunciation and spelling of the three countries
Or we go back to old Norse
Perhaps liberal as in the scandinavian version of it, as in rightwinged
I think the -er adds pluralis to a scentence, doesn't it
you will then become part of our new glorious north sea empire as well
we didn't have lego back then
and even so, let's just say we've got our means and leave it at that ;)))
Most definitely
No because all of those are private enterprises netting very little benefit to the general public and our coalition government is actively neglecting our welfare services, if they aren't further slashing its budget that is ;(
icelandic, anyone
Thats propably true
Forget about our version of liberal when im on reddit (American influende i suppose)
Thats also possible, because if it is liberal in economical sense (scandinavian one) then Denmark is, by far, the least liberal country in Scandinavia
Pretty sure we have the highest taxes
Honestly I never really thought of that

When I was a little kid I thought Denmark and England were the only countries in the world

That one guy that made some of most popular stories
And one of them has a statue and movie
The name of our supreme court is "Højesteret" literally meaning "the highest court".
There are currently 18 judges
99% of all Danes cannot name a single judge because they're rarely discussed
They aren't nominated by politicians but rather by an independent council based on their merits
They also retire by default when they turn 70
We say ones before tens as well
Danish numbers are notorious for sounding strange as they shift from a 10 base to a 20 base similar to French numbers
20 - tyve
30 - tredve
40 - fyrre or fyrretyve
It's four tens but the litteral translation is four twenties
Here comes the strange part:
50 - halvtreds or halvtredsindstyve
It's half third times twenty (3-½ \* 20)
60 - tres or tresindstyve
Three times twenty (3\*20)
70 - halvfjerds or halvfjerdsindstyve
Half fourth times twenty (4-½ \* 20)
80 - firs or firsindstyve
Four times twenty (4\*20)
90 - halvfems or halvfemsindstyve
Half fifth times twenty (5-½ \* 20)
You're messing up cardinal and ordinal numbers
"Halvfjerdsindstyvende" means 70th whereas just "halvfjerdsindstyve" means 70
The Swedish number system is so simple
I envy you guys T_T
I'm surprised he told everyone about our secret  numbering system
Now how are we going to reweal the Swedish spies
Oh well, they will probably mess it up under pressure
I'll change it
We used to have Swedish/Norwegian/English system as well, but apparently switched as it was easier for herring merchants
No joke
I wish, that could help with our subpar math education
118 = one hundred and eight ten = et hundrede atten
177 = one hundred and seven seventy = et hundrede syv og halvfjerdsindstyve
We have **multiple variations** of counting in our thousands
2500 = two thousand five hundred = to tusinde fem hundrede
2500 = two one half thousand = to et halvt tusinde
2500 = five and twenty hundreds = fem og tyve hundrede
Because we say *on* Iceland in Danish
:-)
We just have to make the system even more complex

Lol that reminds me of something that happened on one of the few public bus rides I’ve taken
So basically some woman gets on a few stops after I got on and she said hi to everyone sitting in the vicinity and tried to converse with another passenger
I got instantly annoyed at her greeting me and when she started trying to converse I assumed she was mentally unwell
I felt bad for the other passenger who you could hear the annoyance in her tone when she gave short and close-ended answers back
I’ve had a bus driver in the countryside in Sønderjylland get angry that I didn’t say hi
I always thanked the driver for the trip when I lived in Århus
Would not dare to do that in Copenhagen for sure
I recently spoke with a girl from Portugal about this
She said she would even tell "bye" when she exited the bus from the back
Honestly I find that more rude than polite
Yelling in public, disturbing everybody on the bus and outiside for some arbitrary reason
Seemed odd to me
Yet she found me very rude for saying I never said hello or goodbye, so different strokes
I know this is a joke but I think this stereotype is really overblown personally, I’m in Copenhagen and I probably do a bit of banter with a cashier, a little remark in a queue etc a handful of times a year
On weekend nights it’s full-fledged conversations and mixing of friend groups
I don’t know if my friend group is weird or people stop doing it when they’re older (we’re around 18 ish) or what the deal is
Vi saje mojn når vi komme
I mean, you exit in the back or the middle in Copenhagen, so you would have to either walk up and thank them before you exit, or yell it across the bus  even when I didn't live in Copenhagen I would have found that excessive
"du skal ikke råbe i min bus
er du fuld
" or dead silence is what imagine the response would be :D
If i make smalltalk with the bus driver i would probably get some really weird looks
My cousin still tells the story about a "crazy American" who sat down with him and his friends at a picnic table and started talking to them, trying to make friends since "he didn't know anybody in town and had recently moved here". But that is mostly because they kept trying to cuing him into the fact that they wanted him to leave, but he didn't.
I think a lot is excused due to people being aware that people are more friendly in the US
You just have to be aware of the way people act when you do - if they are clearly not in the mood / don't have time, then drop it (they won't tell you this unless you really crossed the line and missed all their cues, BTW, you have to look at body language or how they answer you), otherwise, you are good
Either that or: "slap lige af mand" and everybody staring in anger
“Damn this queue is moving slowly”, “yeah haha”. It’s mostly not me, but the strangers who initiate this type of back and forth
It doesn’t happen every month, but every other month perhaps
At weekend nights it can be at the supermarket or public transport

Mojn in Southern Jutland Danish is different from German moin

Movies like "Rejsen til Saturn" and "Terkel i Knibe" were really popular when they came out
Jungledyret Hugo 1 & 2 are pretty nostalgic to me
We don’t talk about the third one though
A classic danish animated film would be [Valhalla] from [1986] which is based on a popular [comic series] about the nordic gods
Another very popular animated "film" is a short documentary called [The Tale of the Wonderful Potato] (1985)
Which is about the history of the potato, so it's often shown to younger school students
Hjælp Jeg Er En Fisk is also a really good one
Now we also have "Den ternede Ninja" from the same guy who did "Terkel i Knibe" and it's also really good, though not as violent
Other Danish animated movies which haven't already been mentioned:
Valhalla
Animated movie based on a comic series about Nordic Mythology
Jungledyret Hugo (Jungle Jack)
Very cute and charming movie
Jungledyret Hugo 2 - den store filmhelt (Hugo: The Movie Star - the American version is censored)
Amazing movie, though the American version is censored / edited
~~Jungledyret Hugo 3 - fræk, flabet og fri (Amazon Jack)~~
We don't talk about this movie
Ronal Barbaren (Ronal the Barbarian)
A very funny movie if you can embrace the crass humor
Also, if we are talking more "kid friendly" (though i watched both of those as a preteen), I'd add Valhal to the list
Absolute classic
Or even that show that animated all of H C Andersens fairy tales
"Der var engang" I think it was called :)
*regnen, though tbh the show isn't that popular here in Denmark
Also I think OP was looking for animated shows :)
What do you mean
The Rain is a live action show, it's not animated
Or is there some other show by that name as well
I'm a little yellow fish in the deep blue sea
I think the common complaint is that it's too American :)
My teacher told me he was in a awkward situation when he asked a norwegian friend of his if they should get morgenbrød (morning buns), which apparently mean morning wood in norwegian
Last summer I was on vacation with my Norwegian gf and her family
We had a couple of beers, and when we had to pay I wanted to offer to pay the bill
I asked her “må jeg betale
” which means “may I pay
” in Danish
Her response was not as I expected, she seemed a bit offended and just responded “nej, du MÅ ikke” = “no, you MAY not”.
The misunderstanding was that “må” means “may” in Danish but “have to” in Norwegian
So in her Norwegian ears I asked her “do I have to pay
” and she understandably answered “you don’t HAVE to pay”.
Why are you like this, Finland
Rolig nu :P

People touting that this is the year we repeat EC 1992, and then when it fails, everyone goes: "well, of course
I always knew we never stood a chance
I mean, we did really well at the WC in 2018, but I doubt we will repeat that
Keeping in mind that the EU Championships is even more difficult to advance in, I guess our best bet would be quarterfinals, and that would be alright
>I feel like it always goes the same way
People touting that this is the year we repeat EC 1992
First time I hear of this, that's not at all the common conception, from pundits or fans - people know 92 was a once in a life time fluke
I expect a repeat of the of the 2018 WC where we give every team a fight but ultimately narrowly get kicked out in the knockout phase
Usually my only hope is that we do better than you

Here's one for the Norwegians: How do you feel about Christian IV
You cause one little bloodbath and you get named a tyrant
&#x200B;
But seriously, he's one of those kings rarely mentioned, so not many has an opinion on him
nah, not really
Mostly I would say Danes are not taught an opinion about him at all
Well, the only thing i know about him is his involvement in the Stockholm bloodbath
So i of course view him as a nice person /s
Case in point: Valdemar Sejr (lit
"Victory") is remembered as one of the greatest Danish kings, in part because of crusading in Estonia
So I googled it - because I'm taking a masters in history, so I was very confused when I'd never heard about him being called "Christian den gode" and here's what I found (loosely translated) from [Danmarkshistorien
dk] article about how Christian the 2nd was viewed in Sweden and in Denmark:
"An interesting development about this is that in the 1900-century, a myth about him being called "Christian the Good" in Denmark, started spreading throughout Sweden
\[...\] Partly this myth harmonizes with the image Christian himself tried to create after he was dethroned \[...\] the name "the good" is not anything he was ever called".
[source]
Given our history it's surprising how little Swedish history we learn and that we don't really have any  clear-cut Swedish villains everybody knows - guess it's a bit like losing interest in a long series that didn't turn out the way you hoped
Don't know
That's why I'm asking
They should do a remake of Gøngehøvdingen
No worries
Some people are worried, but the Danish language is such a core part of Danish identity, that it will never truly disappear
I mean
No matter what, the danish being spoken now, won't be spoken in 200 years anyways
Languages are constantly evolving
So I think it is futile to try an preserve them
Practically, it would be a lot easier without all of these languages dividing Europe
as a dane im not at all worried, our language is way too old to be replaced, hell, alot of your words came from us

The West did not create the Arab Spring
And it was the Arab Spring that lead to the Syrian Civil War and the migrant crisis
If you want to blame the West for something, you can blame it for not intervening more forcefully in Syria, and instead just letting Assad with help from Russia and Iran torture the population into submission
The West could easily have removed Assad if it had intervened like it did in Libya
But instead it has just stuck its head in the sand and let hundreds of thousands die and millions be displaced, because people are “tired of wars”. As if wars are going to go away because you are tired of them

of course, i don't want dirt and mud everywhere in my house - especially on my beautiful carpets
Sounds exactly how it’s done in Japan
I don't care if it was expensive
My shoes are comfortable, you better not make me take them off
i clean my floors every other day even though i don't wear shoes inside
so much grime, i must be a magnet to that or something
i still have marks from my mums stilettos from years ago
she seems to think that heels are ok to keep on inside
I honestly have absolutely no idea what tourists eat in Denmark
Our national dish isn't exactly something you'd usually buy off a food truck
Oh, my Dutch roommate makes this from time to time, such a great meal
Fries pork with parsley sauce
(And of course often with potatoes)
But when it was chosen, a couple of years ago
I think the majority of people would have voted for "smørrebrød" (black bread with topping like: pork, ham, sasauge and leverpostej (a kind of pâté))
what poor people eat for lunch, is what we feed tourists
that's pathetic
i'm sorry
Holy shit that's amazing
"normal" ?
Well, yes
but
rabbits are quite pricey compared to other white meats like chicken
i saw a store that sold rabbits for
~25-30 euro if i recall
That's a lot, compared to chicken
and the taste is way too similar IMO, for the price difference to be that big
It is not as normal as chicken, beef and pork
I even think some of my friends might see it as being a bit strange, however I find it delicious
Depends on what you mean by “Not originally from Europe”, because both of my parents are Danish
I was born in Singapore where we lived for a good chunk of years, as my parents were working there
Eventually my parents wanted to go back to Denmark and that’s how i ended up here
Don't think it would cause a huge difference in everyday minutiae if we one day woke up and suddenly were annexed by Sweden or Norway
Norway feels more similar than Sweden
But, I feel like Netherlands are surprisingly close to Denmark
The Dutch are a more sober non-alcoholic and direct version of Danes
I would love to live in Amsterdam
Yeah, that was my experience when visiting NL as well, it's like weirdly similar
Denmark is also very similar to Sweden and Norway for obvious reasons (history) and I obviously didn't expect NL to be *totally* weird and foreign either considering the distances, ethnic groups, geography (seafaring nations) but I certainly didn't expect it to basically feel like home before I went there
There are slight differences here and there in things like building styles and stuff and then there's obviously a language difference, but otherwise it basically felt like being back in Denmark which really surprised me
I didn't really know that much about Dutch culture and people before going there, to me it was just another country in Europe like I see most of them
It seems to be a fairly well functioning country since we rarely hear stories about it etc
but I really had no clue what to expect other than "other European country".
I think it's that even little things feel so familiar that makes it stand out
Most buildings, most streets, most people etc
look just like they do in Denmark
Even simple signs and stuff can be understood if you've got a bit of "talent" when it comes to foreign languages
It's really just about reading the Dutch sign and trying to guess how a word is pronounced and it'll likely remind you of either a Danish word or possibly a German or English word with the same meaning
For example, on the Dutch Wiki article about "Denemarken" it says: "Denemarken is het zuidelijkste Scandinavische land
" and while the "Zuidelijkste" can look a bit complicated to a Dane, if you try to "sound it out" it makes perfect sense
In Danish it's "Sydligste". Any Dane should be able to figure out what "Denemarken is het zuidelijkste Scandinavische land
" means without knowing a word of Dutch honestly
"Danmark er det sydligste skandinaviske land
In someway I feel like Denmark is closer to the Netherlands than Sweden for instance
I also feel like you guys remind me of the UK in terms of housing
Which humour
Denmark is not as progressive as you guys are
I would love to migrate to Amsterdam one day
My cousin from NL said that people in NL finds Danish to be an ugly dutch version of Scandinavian
> it's just that pan Scandinavism never got the same traction in 19th century like pan germanism and pan italianism did
Well, that is sorta pan-germanisms fault
Pan-scandinavism petered out after the loss in the Second Schleswig War
I'd like to see the source of that, because I see the Scandinavian countries like a bunch of brothers
Constantly ragging on each other, but when push comes to shove they'll stand together
But more similar than most countries' own population
>Denmark is building a bridge/tunnel to Germany as counterbalance though
We still have 12 years to create the KALMARUNION
Det må i gerne beholde oppe hos jer
Our “bridge” connecting the east part of Denmark to Germany will be done by then
No and no
not interested in any way
i havn't even watched the classic disney cartoon
(i have read it as a book)
Yeah, I heard about it when it was announced and added it to my IMDB list because of del Toro involvement, but I kinda forgot about it since it was so long ago
But I really like the story of Pinocchio, so I'm happy to see that it's finally starting to move along
Expensive
How dare you
...You're not wrong, though
I agree, at least for Denmark
Very comfortable place to live but not very exciting at all
My favorite activity is traveling abroad
It's actually true, here in the summer times me and my friends have already spent countless of evenings and days together, both male and female friends
In the winter it is often just me and my buds hanging out in the weekends or when we are working out together
Hvad fanden var det lige du sagde omkring mig, din lille tæve
Du skal lige have at vide at jeg graduerede i toppen af frømandskorpset, og jeg har været involveret i adskillige hemmelige angreb på Al-Quaeda, og jeg har over trehundrede bekræftede drab
Jeg er trænet i guerilla krigsførelse, og jeg er den bedste snigskytte i hele Forsvaret
For mig er du ikke andet end bare endnu en skydeskive
Jeg vil satanedme udrydde dig på en måde, som aldrig før er blevet set på denne jord, mærk mine fucking ord
Tror du virkelig du kan slippe afsted med at sige sådan noget lort til mig over internettet

Mens vi snakker så er jeg i gang med at kontakte mit hemmelige netværk af spioner rundt om i Danmark og din IP-adresse spores lige nu, så gør dig klar på stormen, maddike
Stormen der udrydder den ynkelige lille ting du kalder dit liv
Du er fandme død, knægt
Jeg kan være hvor som helst, når som helst, og jeg kan dræbe dig på over syvhundrede måder, og det er bare med mine bare hænder
Ikke blot er jeg trænet i ubevæbnet kamp i udførlig grad, men jeg har også adgang til hele den danske flådes arsenal og jeg vil bruge det i dets fulde omfang til at vaske din elendige røv af kontinentet, din lille skid
Hvis bare du havde vidst hvad for en ugudelig straf din lille ”smarte” kommentar ville bringe ned over hovedet på dig, så havde du måske holdt din fucking kæft
Men du kunne ikke, du gjorde det ikke, og nu betaler du så prisen, din satans kraftidiot
Jeg vil skide raseri over det hele på dig og du vil drukne i det
Du er fucking død, sønnike

we dont have any dialects, except on bornholm, where they speak a mutant swedish danish combo which just sounds funny
to my knowledge thats the only diallect, everyone just speak “rigsdansk” or they atleast try to(sjællandere og jyllændere)
I’m not Scottish obviously, but I cannot stress how important it is to keep both Gaelic and Scots alive
Especially Gaelic given its a Celtic language and there aren’t many Celtic languages alive to begin with
I have a question for you
Just how important are these languages for the Scottish culture and identity
And what is the general consensus in Scotland - do people seem to bother
Absolutely spot on in the sense that it’s often purely political and cultural when it comes to clarifying which languages that classify as independent languages and which ones that could be merely considered as a variation/dialect
However, I’ll try anyways, haha
The alemannisch variations spoken in Switzerland would, imo at least, fit better into the description of being a dialect
Simply because there is a fully fledged dialect continuum within the upper German languages/variations/dialects that connects all the variations
This is completely my own interpretation, but do you see where I’m coming from
I read the first part and was about to call you really old
Turkish guys who own pizzerias and sell Kebabs
How much kebab do you think a country could possibly eat
Now add 30%
Well to be honest the food is pretty good
At least at the places that I have been to
I think which things you reference, depends on what type you are
I grew up where Senecas was often quoted
For example: "Ikke for skolen, men for livet" ("Not for school, but for life")
Other things are more universal, though media is referenced more than books
I'd say there's not much Danish literature that's openly quoted or used by people in everyday life
I'd say H C Andersen is probably most common
Examples like: "what fatter gør er altid det rigtige" ("what dad does is always right" though now said more as a joke), "en fjer bliver til fem høns" ("one feather becomes five hens") and "at rejse er at leve" ("to travel is to live"), comes to mind
One I know as well as been used by politicians, remediated into songs, used at funerals and different parts of it might ring recognisition with most Danes, would be Inger Christensen "Det" (It), which goes (freely translated) like this:
"Et samfund kan være så stenet
At alt er en eneste blok
Og indbyggermassen så benet
At livet er gået i chok
Og hjertet er helt i skygge
Og hjertet er næsten hørt op
Til nogen begynder at bygge
En by der er blød som en krop "
It's hard to translate, because it relies very much on wordplay and doublemeaning, but it's basically:
"A society can be (so/as) stoned
That everything is one block
And the mass of citizens so boned
That life is going into chock
And the heart is all in shadows
And the heart has nearly stopped
Until someone start to build
A city as soft as a body"
I'm looking forward to seeing our teams compete
Eurovision is always in May, which is before the tournament
scenes when 2nd place is Ireland
I mean, Denmark has built up quite a rivalry with Ireland ever since we (the Danes) drew them in the World Cup Qualifying Playoffs in 2017
Plus, there's always been the rivalry/brotherhood with those damn Swedes
What do you think will happen to the group if Russia gets banned on Dec 9th
Earlier today I read that it's very much within the scope, and that St
Petersburg might even get stripped of its hosting
Either way, I hope we won't reach that
I'm looking forward to seeing our teams play
I'm not really sure
Guess we'll find out in 9 days
Funny it's the same in danish
It's official name is ambersand but it's mostly called 'og tegn' which is 'and sign' in danish
that everyone just completely close up after finding their group of friends during education
if you always had terrible classmates, or none that you related to, no luck for you then
Same thing here
As someone who’s still in school: is it really that bad :(
Huh that’s actually true for Denmark too, but for parties (with drinking) only
I don’t know why it’s so acceptable because it’s definitely not in other situations
you might get lucky if you join clubs, attend any social gathering you possibly can, and are very brave with approaching people and letting you goal be known to them
For me - high school was so much better than primary school
Kids aged 12-16 freaking sucks sometimes, but after that people do seem way more mature and open minded
That’s my experience at least
I strongly envy thata
It's not cool being the first to arrive
And in 48 days
It's definitely like that here
Most people start drinking somewhere in between 7th-9th grade, and by the time you hit high school, there are gonna be parties pretty much every 7-14 days
If you don't go, and don't drink, people are going to think that you're weird
It's very sad, but nonetheless, that's how it is
Beer in the shower, beer while getting dressed, then 5 beerbongs while your mates and you catch up before the party
Never heard of this
That seems way too forward for Danes to be comfortable with
They would probably just think "they must not like onions".
Why on earth would you put onion on a kebab
Here they say "mester".
His name is bossman
I'm kissing every day
But I never knew onion on a kebab was a thing
Salat, dressing and some chilisauce
'Nuff said
It's the bomb
Trust me
Copenhagen, the area was called "the Kings Merchant Harbor" for centuries, eventually shortened to "the Merchants Harbor" (købmændenes havn) - which became København (Copenhagen)
Because the danish king at the time wanted to build a castle and make it his town
Then it became the capital
Det rager mig en høstblomst
I'm not sure how to translate this
Rager: is rake or scrape
So directly translated it's something like "it rakes me a harvest flower". It's a pretty negative way of saying you have zero interest
A harvest flower, is an old term for flowers that bloom in autumn
Oh yeah, some people use papand instead of høstblomst, and that translates to "cardboard duck".
“Jeg er ligeglad” (I am equally happy)
“Det er lige meget” (it is equally as much)
"Spurgt", originally meaning "asked", became a way of saying "did I ask
"/"I don't care" in around 2015
It's mostly used among younger people
"Jeg er ligeglad" directly translated would be "I am equally glad/happy". That's how we express "I don't care". Doesn't really make sense in Danish either as far as I know
So one that isn't swearing: In Danish jeg er ligeglad, litteraly translated means I'm equally happy
It doesn't sound so positive though
followed up by yours grandparents with "så du aldrig glad"
\> for example, France longest land border is not in Europe, it's with Brazil in South America

How about Russia
Denmark is one of the highest ranking countries for happines
But also one of the countries with the highest suicide rate
Also, us Nordics like our Christmas TV calendars

So do we
It's a Nordic tradition I think
And its damn good
> The Iraqi geologist Farouk al-Kasim discovered and helped us secure our oil reserves
Is he the inspiration behind the Sheikh in Flåklypa
In Denmark some also watch the Disney animation at christmas
Dinner for One is also a tradition in Denmark
Exclave
Yeah, definitely a trap
- People are nice, when they don't try to cheat you because they think you're a tourist
(that only happened in Valletta)
- The language is an odd mix of Arabic, Italian, and English
Your food is an equally odd mix, and it's awesome
(One lunch I had from a Pastizzeria:  Pasta and veggies in a creamy sauce with a dash of cinnamon, covered with a lid of pastry)
- Holy fuck, fix your roads
- I like that everything is super close
Which, I guess, comes kinda naturally
- It really shows it's size
Everyone seems to know everyone, which can either be really nice, or really awful if nepotism is a part of life
until very recently, i honestly thought it was a tropical island near spain and portugal

Great novel taking place during hte Danish colonization of Greenland
For crime novels the "[Department Q] series by Jussi Adler-Olsen is quite popular, but for non-fiction I would recommend "[The ISIS Hostage] ("Ser du månen, Daniel") by Puk Damsgård
If you could read Danish, then I'd recommend Jussi Adler-Olsen
There's even a movie based on Journal 64, which is a book in the series
Fully recommended

Meaning "Can I please use the toilet kindly sir
There's a great part in Die Hard 3 where the german(?) bad guys are trying to imitate native English speakers by using that phrase
The words can't even be translated like that tho
Whether "a" or "an" should be used is determined by the first letter of the following noun, where "en" and "ett" are random based on gendered nouns
We don't use nicknames
I certainly don't know anyone who do or any nickname-versions of another name
Especially among younger people, it seems fairly popular to nickname people with longer names by the first two syllables in their names
* Frederik -> Frede
* Karoline -> Karo
* Isabella -> Isa
etc
It can also be the last two syllables, e.g. girls/women named Sofie are often just called "Fie". When I was a wee lad, girls named Isabella often went under "Bella", but it seems have changed to "Isa" in today's kids
Danish doesn’t really have that many common nicknames but now that I think about it, we often just pronounce each other’s names in English to sound more lighthearted (or maybe that’s just me and my friends and family
anyone else do this
The idea that Facebook would back off the biggest market on the planet because of a rule change is prepostorous
Biggest market in terms of purchasing power
Only around 500 million people tho
Fucking disgusting of Facebook
Actually last year or was it 2 years ago, Facebook opened a new data center in Odense Denmark so would that be for  nothing if they stop operating
I wish
They won't, but Europe would be better for it
Facebook is poison
Shut that shit down
Instagram and Twitter too
And for the love of God, murder TikTok, and salt the earth

Ok, go ahead
>“Facebook is not threatening to withdraw from Europe,” a Facebook spokesperson said, adding that the court filing simply lays out how “Facebook, and many other businesses, organisations and services, rely on data transfers between the EU and the US in order to operate their services

I never use Facebook
"We support global rules on data treatment". I wonder how many times he had to stop himself from laughing out loud
Memes was never in danger in the first place
Somebody, like Facebook, just tried to spin it like that to make it seem bad to most ordinary people
GDPR is all about protecting your data and digital ownership - I.E. You can't just copy an image and sell it without permission
but let's say if they do leave EU, they've invested so much money in a data center for only a couple of years of use lol
You mean signal
But comrade, it is not your penis, it's our penis
I truly hope that the EU steps up to fill in the vacuum left by Trump's regime, as the forerunner of the western world and the safeguard of democracy
In all fairness, I've never heard of telegram until just now
Only knew of signal because of the Hong Kong protests
I don't know anyone that uses either sadly :(
I snorted ;-) Then was a bit saddened by how spot on that is
Sounds like the exact same point the Danish prime minister (Anders Fogh Rasmussen) made in a speech to the Arab world in 2005 during the Danish “cartoon crisis”.
Spoiler alert, it didn’t work and the point about not being able to legally restrict specific types of cartoons fell on deaf ears
Signing into law that portraying Muhammad is illegal, is the only thing that will appease them
Well, the point is that we need to be able to discuss things, and calling out racism and xenophobia is important for that discussion
If you are being called racist or xenophobe, maybe it's worth taking a look at your statements and try to understand how it might be seen as something different from "just stating the facts". Maybe not
Yeah, I can see why he might not be liked in France
But at least the take away from various newspapers is that France has stagnated and is in dire need of reforms
Of course, reforms are not always popular
His external image is however excellent
Perhaps he can can help unite the Europeans to take collective action against extremism
I had the same perception about French until, on a vacation, my dad asked me what language I thought the table next to us were speaking
It was a group of young people and I honestly thought they were speaking some dialect of German, because it sounded so harsh and ugly
But no, it was French
I fully agree that the words must be used only when applicable, and if someone calls you out for using them too lightly, indeed you should think about whether they might be right
It certainly goes both ways
There's nothing wrong with "attacking" someone rhetorically if you believe their premise or conclusion is wrong due to it being based on racism, or if you believe that they are arguing in bad faith to promote xenophobia
Both of these will invalidate the argument being made, and must be pointed out no matter what "side" you're on
EDIT: Let me just start by saying I agree with everything Macron is saying in this video
It seems maybe you think I am against what Macron is saying
> ...so every conclusion that involves race, is automatically wrong
no matter what
Of course not
Arguments based on biological race can be right or wrong, but arguments based on the racist ideology are only right if you subscribe to that ideology
Non-racist racial argument example:
>Our new medicine might have side effects on people with genetically brown skin, and ethnic Arabs tend to have brown skin, therefore our medicine might have side effects on any ethnic Arab
Racist racial argument example:
>Extremist Islamic terror has happened, and the perpetrators of such terror attacks tend to be Arab, therefore we should stop offering asylum to Arabs
The first example builds on the idea that there is a genetic difference between races, which is objectively true
The second example builds on the idea that this genetic difference causes all Arabs\* to be somehow mentally / morally inferior (in this case more violent), which is considered obvious within racist ideology, but for which there is no evidence
If you subscribe to racist ideology, there is nothing wrong with the structure of the argument
The statement "everyone has basic human rights" is an ideological idea, not an objective fact
But if you agree with that idea, you must accept arguments based on that idea
If you reject the idea, you must reject arguments based on the idea
\*Then there is the sort of secondary racism where people try to get around it by saying "I'm not referring to ethnic Arabs, but middle-eastern Muslims / Syrians / X", where X is some group consisting almost exclusively of ethnic Arabs
All things considered it is only the plug and that it can charge normally via that safely, so they can still do more above that
Absurd micro management
No I don't want the damn government to tell me which charger I can use, or limit the phones available for me to purchase based on what chargers they have
This belong in a Soviet Union dictate economy
What's next
Standardized computer monitor size
All must use 17"!
The phone doesn't tell me anything I can't ignore if I want
If I don't like it, I buy another
If the phone companies want me to buy their product they best make sure to make something I like, and which is better than the other options available
New innovative charging technologies might be one such thing
Or unusual phone design which does not allow for USB-C form factor could be another
Although not after the EU has dictated this aspect of course
Would a phone without any charger (perhaps only remote charger) be allowed by EU
The new legislation do tell me something which I cannot ignore even if I wanted
The government is simply limiting my choices
For my own good I'm sure they'd claim
So mandatory 17" computer monitor sizes next
Can we get standardized shoe colour also
Brown ought to suit everybody
Anyone can license the Lightning connector, they usually just don't because it costs money and USB-C and micro-USB don't.
> But the the law doesn't stipulate anything regarding a certain technology
That's because it's not a law
MEPs don't have the staff assigned to do detailed calculations on stuff like this, so they're supposed to write what they want (e.g. standardize x) and then the Commission (which does have the extremely competent staff) throws something actually workable together and bounces it back to the MEPs, who either accept it or ask the Commission to change something

See Utrecht, Netherlands for an example of how a city center can be reclaimed for pedestrians/cyclists
It's very nice imo
EDIT: [Example video]
Uh, cuz cars are big
That's quite misleading
There are also people IN the cars
The streets aren't just empty, unused space like that painting will have you believe
Yes, my god
It's kind of like Moscow
Dubai is even worse, except in Dubai you have overpasses instead of underpasses
There's hardly any traffic at all on that road, those cars are just for the people that live there
Here is [a video] of that particular street even
Cars are still allowed into the city of course (there are several important roads for the throughput of busses and cars), but the city is focused around being most accessible to pedestrians/cyclists
It's still an ongoing process, most changes have only come in the last couple years
I included a video about those changes in my original comment if you want to check it out
Well, that's an improvement

> A lot of people are saying that celebrity athletes are paid what they are paid due to them generating massive amounts of money
Pay is determined by what they generate but also how easily their skillset is replaceble
The people who produce Apple products are easily replaced despite creating a lot of money
A microbiologist create some money and has a skillset that is not easily replaced and the pay reflects the demand
A celebrity athlete might have a great skillset that cannot easily be replaced and also create lots of money for the owner which is why they can demand the pay they do
Its all about supply and demand

Fear is a useful and rational response to something dangerous like this
When people no longer fear it, they stop giving it the respect it deserves
They start mis-prioritising
Some of the people I know have started partying again, despite the fact the pandemic is still very much ongoing
I know most of them would have taken it very seriously 6-8 months ago, but now the situation has normalised enough to the point where they feel like boredom outweighs fear over something that is actually cause for that fear
We understand why, it's human psychology
Soldiers who go to war have a heartrate of a trillion the first time they hear real enemy gunfire in the vicinity
After a while they acclimate and adapt
That's what humans do
Unfortunately when we adapt, we don't always keep our good sense
I had a friend who went to Afghanistan, and he was often part of a group that went out and used a metal detector and other equipment to scan for IEDs
Eventually he became so jaded he would just step on stuff on the ground that looked suspicious, to see if it would blow up or something
It's kind of the same thing
He had never actually found an IED, in a long time serving in this role - so his brain just goes "It's not really a threat
". Even though he knew the ongoing statistics of how many soldiers (and civilians) were being killed by IED's on a regular basis
Eventually his buddy got injured from an IED and he took much more care after that
Unfortunately anecdotal evidence can overwrite the facts we have about the wider situation, in a persons brain
You might see, in your care home, multiple high-risk individuals get sick with the virus and be totally fine with no sideeffects, and then that will subconsciously warp your understanding of the danger it poses
But someone in a very unlucky care home where a whole lot dies, even young people - might draw the opposite conclusion; that it is more dangerous than it really is
The best we can do as humans is understand our own psychological limitations and how dangerous small datasets are
Then we rely on governments or other such institutions to gather the data and make objective decisions based on it
This wasn't targetted at you, by the way
I just had to get it off of my chest because I feel like people in my social spheres are endangering themselves and others by not adequately understanding this

"Unlike spears, nuclear bombs are only good to sit on". Unfortunately I can't remember who said it anymore
Aight imma move to Switzerland, they seem to know how to avoid war
As long as nuclear weapons exist, i'm very confident that we will never see a direct conflict between the largest world powers (USA, China, Russia)
On top of that, the world has changed in such a way that interdependency is so much higher today compared to the last time we had a great war because of globalization and international trade
War between the US and China, for example, is in no ones interest, even if you don't consider the potential of nuclear war, because of the way both countries economies relies on each other

It's also telling that this is the first time in Notre Dame's 850 year old history that it is actually on fire, so it's likely something that has been added more recently that's the root of the fire

I heard a great analogy of what UK wanted
Imagine, You (as EU) have a fitness centre, and the UK is a member of that
then, after a while, the UK says: hey, i dont wanna be a member anymore, because reason
EU: Ok
bye
UK: But i'd still like to use the weights and the shower
EU: eh, wait a second
that's not how things work
brilliant
What a god damn genius

Amsterdam has way more to offer than weed and hookers
It is truly a beautiful city; great museums and the canal cruises are very relaxing and informative
I even took at day's tour to see the countryside the first time I was there; saw how clogs are made, their wooden windmills that are still used
Sadly didn't get to see the tulip fields, but I have heard they are mesmerizing
So yeah, even if I was a 24 year old broshit; and my mate even moreso, we both still enjoyed the city and the country
Hell, my mate didn't quite get why I wanted to do anything else but smoke weed, but he came around when I suggested we take the Heineken tour first
they are just being honest in their intentions
>After the USA did a few moon landings, they declared themselves the winners of the space race
Always funny to me how much they clearly moved the goalposts on that one
Everyone will remember USA as the winner of the space race, but it was probably the Soviets who had the biggest win of all
First man in space is amazing
Doesn't change the fact that the moon is a completely arbitrary metric
Why not Mars

I like this explanation better:
UK: I want unicorn
EU: Unicorns don't exist
You can have a pony instead
UK: I vote against your pony
EU: We have already discussed this in detail
Pony or nothing
UK: I vote against your pony
EU: Then you get nothing
UK: I vote against your nothing
EU: You really do not understand, do you
UK: I want more time to think about it
EU: For the pony or for the nothing
UK: I want unicorn

This reminds me of a statement by an Egyptian Imam during the aftermath of the publication of the Muhammed Cartoons in Jyllands-Posten, during the crisis period where a lot of Islamic countries boycotted Denmark
He said (quoted from memory): "Imagine if WE made fun of your prime minister, your queen, or Jesus

That's like the whole point

To change the politicians' minds, you need to change the minds of the people who vote for those politicians
If a politician gets convinced to change his opinion because of some protesters, he might no longer be representing the people who voted him into office in the first place and therefore be replaced at the coming election
those are some ugly ass kids
Yes it is really nice to not have German (no offence Germans) but its also nice to be able to have kids without them having to worry

The ocean step is probably the by far most important one of the bunch, because if the marine algae that produce 70-80% of all the oxygen we breathe today die, we're *all* fucking toast, not just humans
And they're dying because of the acidification of the oceans due to the increased amount of CO2 absorption and plastic pollution
And China and India are the worst offenders when it comes to ocean pollution
the oxygen in our atmosphere is enough to last us 5000 years, we're fine in that regard, and earth is fine too, it's been through highs and lows of oxygen multiple times
the problem is co2 absorption and retention which algae does a shit ton of
+2°C is impossible
Why worry about something that is impossible

BTW: Great that you understood my reference
Based on the downvotes, I assume a lot of people don't get the similarity between Chernobyl and Global warming
5000 years is not a very long time in evolutionary terms
I mean sure, humanity would then have lots of time to colonize space or invent weather machines or something crazy, but our environment will then be literally on the clock, and there's nothing we can do to reverse that kind of damage
Good thing some people in this world will settle for something a little better than nothing then :)

You seem to have made an error with the border of Crimea, buddy
I like how nothing happend to Denmark
Danish/German border isn't that far from the original
That's way to close to reasonable
Denmark's border is basically the same, so i'm fine with this
I'd imagine Bornholm would've been given to sweden though
Makes you realize how much effort has gone into making these countries
Not just the borders themselves, but everything that makes it possible for societies to live together
It's worth remembering this, when we look at war other places in the world
We ourselves might have peace now, but it took a terrible amount of work
Also worth remembering when people want to downplay the nation-state in favor of EU
It takes allot of work to make a peaceful semi-functioning society
If we want a good EU we better put the same effort in it
I vote yes for this map because Denmark gets more land yes yes
as a dane i want these borders for the sole reason that denmark has it's land back

It's like when you are writing something and you reach the edge of the paper so you gotta bend what you are writing it a bit downwards
I doubt that holds 100%, but there is some truth in it

It's a scary world we live in, but probably less scary if you live near a McD, Starbucks or if Amazon delivers packages to your country
I should write my thesis about this
You used the wrong image for Denmark
I love all of these but we need one from Sjælland and one from Jylland, I just can't vibe with that city view, that's not my Denmark ;)
The danish version is which one
Haven't seen that one anywhere else
I love the map
although it's the wrong image in Denmark (we are partial to the Kaj the Frog-Fi)
At first I thought this was wrong as I remember this being legal for a long time in Denmark
Turns out it was legal since 1989 to be in a same-sex civil union (married outside the church) in Denmark but the Netherlands did beat us to the marriage thing with about a whole decade
I hope equality, freedom, and happiness spreads to all
Very happy anniversary
And so it started
Can you get married also in the catholic churches
Danish churches are state-run so the laws for those dictate what the churches can do
Also I guess you can prohibit discrimination in certain contexts

Eruptions are rarely "predictable" down to a human timescale, and there's no guarantee that the next eruption at Yellowstone is gonna be on a scale that clickbait articles wants you to be afraid of
Plus, this is all happening on a geological timescale
Plus or minus a few thousand years isn't anything significant, and who knows, it might very well still take tens of thousands of years before Yellowstone is gonna erupt next
That looks amazing
Is there a link to a news source
Here in Denmark we haven't had a single day of snow through the entire winter
It sucks
“iT’s jUsT TEmpEraTUrE SWiNgs yOu gUYs, pERfeCtLY nORmaL”
In Denmark it’s raining all the time through, Nørrebro in Copenhagen has been flooded last I checked in the news
Yeah, it's freezing literally only in northern Scandinavia and central Iceland
I biked 8 km yesterday
The only negative was the strong headwind on the way home
40kph, or thereabouts
Except it's so stormy in Denmark at the moment, that it really feels like a solid -20° :]
I'm not looking forward to July
I have a faint suspicion I'll be buying a ~~jet engine~~ air cooler
Conspiracy time: Europeans are secretly boosting global warming to save money by not needing to travel south
We had a Danish band write a song about this in 1982:
Denmark as well
And holy shit, look at the size of the area where temperatures are between 10° and 20° Celsius
In mid February
Good thing Hell is so nice and temperate now then
It's been a long time since we've had snow in December
But January and February have almost always had a lot of snow
According to DMI, Odense had records of 2,5cm of snow in 2019, 11cm in 2018, 4cm in 2017 so your friends memory seems to be not so great haha
I can't speak for Odense but where i'm from we had snow in the beginning of last year
I'm from Odense and your friend is wrong
We had snow every winter except this one, at least going back to 2016
I already mentioned Denmark
There's no need to add specific regions
That does explain the otherwise silly phaseout of the carbon neutral nuclear plants
Had a white Christmas here in Nordsjælland last year
Motherfu-..... Of all the places, the Devil Island gets a white Christmas
Well, we are tied with Vendsyssel when it comes to being the statistically most likely place in the country to experience a white Christmas
I think on average, there's about a 20% chance of a white Christmas here
Being so close to Sweden, Nordsjælland gets slighter colder than the rest of the country (except Vendsyssel)
My hometown actually received the first snow of the 2019-2020 winter back in early November
I live in Vendsyssel and it's been so freaking long since we had a white christmas
Parts of Vendsyssel had snow on Christmas Eve in 2018 (same as us
By last year I meant 2018, not 2019 haha)
Yea
And it gets more sparse every year
To be fair, white Christmases are very rare in Denmark
Since 1900, there has only been 9 white Christmases (more than 90% of the country covered in snow)
They happened in:
1915
1923
1938
1956
1969
1981
1995
2009
2010
That means that statistically, there's only a white Christmas in Denmark every 13 years, locally every 5 years
2009 and 2010 were absolutely crazy as a white Christmas had never happened two years in a row
Yes but as you say that is if you only count the ones where 90% of the country is covered
I remember several local white christmasses in the 2000s
They would have to be in the early 00's then
2000-2004 were the only locally white Christmases until 2009, and in 2002 the snow only feel in Sønderjylland
It's possible that Vendsyssel and the areas around Aalborg had snow in 2000, 2001, 2003 and 2004
That seems about right, but where can you see this information
With a little detective work, you can find articles published by tv2 vejret that sometimes mention previous snowy Christmases
Try googling "Hvid jul [year]" etc to get results
This is a year old, why are you posting this

I'll vote on whatever cantidate promises to ban words in political cartoons

they also import a ton of stuff and would want the same thing
and they're still a member of nato
Im fearful for when this reaches Denmark
Im pretty sure the idiotic old people who run my country would gladly leave europe because they think our tiny fucking country could survive on our own
If we do, Hey /r/Norway
how about another Union eh
As a Dane I can say that people in Denmark did talk about the UK leaving EU as being a possible instigating incident to make us leave as well
I've heard it said that it would be appropriate that we joined the EU due to (our trade with) the UK and now we would leave due to the UK
>Also I didn't see them mentioning Austria or Denmark as likely candidates to leave, only Spain, Italy and Netherlands from the cartoon
[Well
Norway normally has their shit together
I think deep down, most scandinavians would like a Norway-managed Kalmar Union
At least I do

I guess you could say i was scared straight
> Everyone here is talking about reforming the EU somehow
Everyone wants change
No one agrees what it should change into
The eternal problem of politics
It's a good way to promote unions
You could easily pass a law like that in Denmark and noone would bat an eye because if you don't have a union agreement you don't have employees either

Danish newspapers are having a field day today
Saw [another one] on my way home, the title is a pun I’m a bit too tired to explain properly, but it’s basically combining “a bull in a China shop”,  “throwing rocks in glass houses”, and our nation’s highest honorary title of “knight of the elephant order” that’s often given to state leaders
So it says “[name of paper] bestows new honor on Donald Trump: Elephant of the glass store”
As a dane
I think its totaly fine by the news papers doing this
This is like when American liberals make those "The Queen of England makes Trump look like a dumb dumb"
The world's on fucking fire, Mette is too busy blaming refugees for all of our issues but at least we get to feel great because Trump saying an insane thing to get all of our eyes off of the actual issues in the world worked as per usual
By the by, there's concentration camps in the US and in China, and the Danish government has not denounced either
This news paper is actually slightly right wing biased
It’s a totally over the top front page - but guys
your president wanted to buy us
Calling BT a newspaper is an exaggeration - it's a tabloid at best
Altså han er en idiot
In the top right it says - train on womans breast
I would hardly call BT a newspaper
"Newspaper"
BT is a tabloid
Not exactly a newspaper
This is not stuff that the world nor Danish citizens need to be exposed to in this way
And also, there are no news here; we all know that this happened, that newspapers write about it isn’t news
That they do it in such a horrible, dumb way might be news
To anyone who would care to listen
DUMB DANISH NEWS SLANDER DONALD DUMB
Come on, get this off the front page
Everyone is getting dumber by the second and no one gains anything, not even the newspaper
That is some first grade rambling
Its like a mapping of a brain that is in free fall
Completely scattered
Expect lots of "Something is rotten in the state of Denmark". Good grief do American journalists love that one
He invited himself publicly with very short notice
He then received and accepted a formal invitation and the Danish government started the extensive preparations
Then Donnie threw a tantrum and cancelled it all because he couldn't have Greenland
To be fair, she actually called his *idea* absurd, not him directly
B.T. is just taking the usual tabloid poetic license
Time helps a lot, too
Some 200 years ago the Nordics used to not be able to go a year without some bloody massacre taking place, either Denmark doing it to Sweden, or the other way around
and often over Norway
Few countries indeed have warred as much, and spilled as much of eachother's blood, as Denmark and Sweden
But these days we're best friends, albeit the kind of friends that constantly tease eachother
Unless Football's on of course
then it's war
War with singing, and beers, and funny hats
Are there any ongoing conflicts in the Balkans
I know only some of the wars in the 90's, and have the impression that that was last when there was armed conflicts in the region
This is not a “Danish reaction” - it’s the reaction of a single Danish tabloid, which earns money from being as controversial as possible
In an American context I would call them more "racist moderate biased", but you're not wrong
,Egon
"Golf player accused"
"Grabbed woman's breasts"
"Torbjørn Olsen denies EVERYTHING"

Anyone that has been to Helsingør  knows the smell of rotting seaweed is offputting
Yup, and in this process we've wasted a lot of tax resources
Actually neither, we reject consonants out of principle so the Danish word is "Dum", but here it's the English "Dumb", which we then tend to over pronounce because why else is that b there
No, but Trump is often pronounced as Trumb in Denmark for some reason
No it’s the opposite actually
Wordfinal p/t/k is pronounced b/d/g. Wordfinal b/d/g is pronounced v(w)/ð/j.
Now you get why we're pissed
Yes
He mentioned off-handedly while talking to US media that after visiting Poland, he would visit us in Denmark
Then about 3 weeks later he mentioned on twitter that he was interested in buying Greenland
Greenland is part of the Kingdom of Denmark, though mostly independently run in all matters except foreign politics
Greenland's prime minister already said no  to the offer, and the Danish prime minister said that Greenland is Greenland's, so even if Denmark would sell it, we couldn't. Trump has the impression that Greenland is like an overseas territory or colony, which as empires used to do, could be sold and bought and traded
That's not the world we live in, and haven't been for generations
That is why in so many ways the, at the time, serious interest from Trump to buy Greenland off Denmark was, to quote our PM "Absurd". To which Trump, as the mature person he is, promptly called of his own invitation to Denmark, two weeks before he was meant to arrive
He was supposed to meet the Queen and PM, they were slightly offended by the double diplomatic slight of first inviting himself, and then cancelling for no good reason
I think our US-correspondent said that in international diplomatic circles, cancelling within 2 weeks is usually only done due to death or national tragedies and the like
I guess he could call for another state of emergency and use that as the excuse
Was just in Stockholm over the summer actually
So I hereby give you leave to buy all the beers you want

do you mean wienerbrød?
I have no idea if you are right or not but most people on the far right claim they are not the far right
By who
We have right winged people in Denmark who aren't racist bigots
Those are not far-right
A typical Polish Catholic fundamentalist bigot i would consider far-right, yes
But it goes both ways right
Suggest anything left of center and you are suddenly considered radical left winged ANTIFA commie

Actually that’s Caesar’s salute
I mean you're not wrong, but Hitler kinda changed that
I searched about roman salutes and I found this comment:
"Most historians and classics professors agree that we really aren't sure Rome had a salute
Yes, as the photos show below, people's arms are out, but some are reaching, some were carved in that pose to show dignity, prowness, and even courage
The “moving forward general dictating his soldiers” thing was huge in ancient Rome
There aren't many, if any, mentions clearly by any ancient historians like Pliny, Tacitus or Suetonius
So it's all a guess
Seems like roman salutes are highly televised and historians are unsure whether the ancient romans acutally used it as a salute
I found out the first who officially used the salute was the italiens in 1920 when the facist party came to power
Correct me if im wrong
Wait ... Binface

Try taking the train in Denmark anywhere else than Copenhagen and you'll feel differently about taking the train
God I love trains, this is my biggest wish
European countries needs to share common standards   and create a competitive market for train tech
But it's cheaper to fly, so why bother
Japan's Shinkansen is certainly used by commuters
Lots of them too
In the morning rush hours, the Shinkansen are so packed that some people have to stand up for long stretches
Also, a bunch of French cities (such as Tours) have a good amount of people who commute to Paris via the TGV
That can't be the entire story
It's about 3x more expensive to travel to southern europe by train from Copenhagen than it is by plane and you need to change several times + it takes many times longer
Edit:
Train infrastructure is a lot more expensive than it is for aircraft
It's an enormous investment for many countries
I can't afford to take trains though
I could then choose to not travel for the sake of the environment, but really how many people can be expected to make that sacrifice
I assume many Danes aren't surprised by how the US is doing, but given that this is in the wake of the whole Greenland/Canceled Visit Trump egotrip, I would assume that made the view even worse
Even though it is few people, I really wonder what made some people improve their opinion
Maybe they just dont follow the news
Am Dane, can confirm
But to be fair, that has been a constant for several years now
The more I learn about the US, the more of a shithole it appears to be
It's still a cool place in many ways but I most certainly do not wish to live there as it stands
[Sweden is like]
Let's not kid ourselves, the handling of the Corona virus is one factor
Ridiculing our Queen and badmouthing our PM is another
Trying to "buy" Greenland is a third
Increasingly xenophobic and nationalistic policies is a fourth
Increasing you consulate presence eightfold in Greenland after realizing a straight up "sale" is a non-option is a fifth
Corona handling might be the least important of these factors imo
DANMARK
DANMARK
Woohoo
Denmark
We're number one, we're number one, we're number one
Fuck
Yeah, there has been some serious Trump and USA hate going in Denmark
Now do one:
* Has your view of the EU changed during the Corona virus crisis
What EU
* Has your view of Denmark changed during the Corona virus crisis
You mean after blocking the EU rescue funds
* Has your view of Sweden changed during the Corona virus crisis
lol
* Has your view of Italy changed during the Corona virus crisis
Can we rename it Typhoid Mary
* Has your view of Spain changed during the Corona virus crisis
Are you guys allowed to leave your house yet
Can we call you Typhoid Mary's sister
* Has your view of Germany changed during the Corona virus crisis
How's the EU aid coming along
Pay up dude
I'm Danish and would have picked stayed the same, simply because it's what i expected would happen under trumps leadership
I have absolutely no faith in the US after they elected Trump
His world view only ever worked when information of the USA was scarce and filled with propaganda, like it was in the communist bloc
USA has always been a bully to it's surroundings and only a beacon of hope to their own citizens
Certainly not to the South American, middle eastern or Asian countries
Arguably not even to Europe, but they were instrumental to Europe's safety during the cold war
Pretty ironic he considered it a country to uphold civil rights when you look at the apartheid system that was present
Lad os håbe at amerikanerne svækker deres samfund indtil det punkt hvor vi kan invadere dem gennem Grønland, lol
Give us Rufus Gifford back, then we'll talk
I don’t hate you
I gotta admit, I'm in [this] camp, more than anything
You guys actually had me going there for a moment
Response was slow, and idiots were being idiots, but most people were actually dealing with it somewhat decently
Then a revolution started seemingly over the weekend, and suddenly nobody is staying home anymore, and cases
Happened again
Stay safe, mate
Oh no we love hating stuff
It's one of the reasons why we're so happy
You should try it
Typhoid Mary's whole thing was that she was a symptom free carrier
Considering how badly Italy and Spain have suffered from Covid-19 it's a pretty poor comparison
I texted a swedish family member actually
but they also didn't really have an answer to the difference
Maybe the view was already significantly worsened after the whole weird thing with the rapper incident and trump getting involved with the swedish justice system
Damn, I miss Rufus, guy was a true legend
Yeah, that gremlin Trump has put in his place is pretty awful
What about **Plague Rats** then
Has a nicer ring to it too
"*Are you going to the lands of Plague Rats this summer
*" "*Yes, i love pasta and death
In any case, super pathetic that Europeans are so desperate to look for failures in the USA, when there are plenty to look at, at home
Very few people actually hate Americans here
We hate your president, we hate your institutionalized racism, your nationalism (you call it patriotism) and your regressive religious views, but in general we get along great with individual Americans - especially if you're one of the many Americans who also dislike that stuff
empathy (or maybe I mean compassion
eh, either one) is not really your strong suit huh
Looking at the statistics, the USA is #12 in cases / million people
The only countries in Europe that are higher is Vatican City and San Marino
But they only had 12 and 698 cases respectively, so I think you are being a bit tough on them
Right now they are down to 0 and 3 cases respectively
You are technically right, but you are still wrong
Empathy with those that themselves show empathy
How do you feel the level off empathy with Americans are in this thread
By "here" I meant in Denmark
Other countries might be less American friendly, but I doubt you'd (commonly) meet outright hostility anywhere in Europe simply for being American
Well, maybe in, like, Serbia
It varies from post to post, but I see more people expressing dislike of Trump and a general like of the American people, and compassion with what they're going through than I see people making really inappropriate (and more importantly mean spirited) jokes about how many Americans have died
You're being a dick, and all the whataboutism in the world is not going to make that ok, so please just stop it
Dude, you need to read up on the meaning of "whataboutism". The issue is that a lot of Europeans here (and in the polled people presumable) seem to take a perverse pleasure in seeing Americans suffer
Doing the same to their own country and countrymen might show them the error of their way
Or not
Either way, unlike all those other people expressing genuinely nasty view of the USA, it doesn't take a genius to see mine only serve to express the point
When Europeans talk shit about America these days, you gotta understand that it's in large part directed at your government, more specifically Trump
People still like many things about America, we all watch your movies and your tv series, listen to your music, read your litterature, play your games, and buy your blue jeans
Many of us are even fluent in your language for this reason
American cultural influence on Europe is immense, and perhaps that's why we're so frustrated with your politics, because we can't really do anything about it, but it does affect us a great deal
No I don't. Whataboutism can be boiled down to: "Those guys are being dicks, so I should get to be a dick too
Why are you calling me out and not them
" It's fucking childish
Which would be relevant if I as an American was trying to deflect criticism away from the USA by pointing at other countries
But not when I as a European is trying to make the point that it is pathetic to wallow in the misery of others
Especially, when there is plenty of fuckups going around in our own house
whataboutism is "don't look at us, look at those other guys" (incidentally, pretty much what this thread is about) - it is not "look at yourself, not those other guys"
No, I'm saying you're using it to deflect criticism away from your own dickish behaviour
"I'm only being an asshole and making mean spirited jokes about Italy and Spain because those guys were assholes to Americans
" What you're doing is wrong, what they're doing is wrong
That just means you're not the only asshole in this thread

I’ve understood that he will only step down if his party fails to form a government based on the election results
Edit:
Dictatorship isn't decided by the existence of spotify and paypal
Montenegro has had innumerable elections going back decades where many parties are divided with shares of 20%, 30%, 40%, this doesn't happen in places like Putin's Russia (even with the fake opposition parties)
Or central Asian dictatorships
Or North Korea
I don't see how

Fiddling with numbers to reinforce your political point ought to be a moral sin in journalism, however correct your point might otherwise be

Accurate
We already had it on r/Denmark ;(
Elections have consequences
Scotland deserves socialism good and hard, no doubt
Still you didn't secede when you could, the money was too good I guess
> I mean, the UK is fundamentally a socialist state so not much would change
Thanks to the scottish vote
> No, Thanks to the NHS, the police force, The Fire and Rescue Services, To the Care system
Denmark has all of these things too, if you're even Danish
No those are some of the causes of voting socialists in
Other causes are mass migration, a refusal to follow election results and so on
Denmark's Fire and Rescue Services are completely privately operated btw
Socialism is the first step towards communism
I know, socialism totally works, the others just did it wrong, this time we will get it right

*Danish or Norwegian
Historians tend to disagree
Wasn't it the Danes
I was always told it was Danish vikings
There is a source detailing vikings arriving in England in 787 as well, but I don't know how accurate it is
DANMARK LÆNGE LEVE
Never forget that day the vikings saved the great treasuries of Lindesfarne from a great fire ️️️
Ay Norwegian weren't alone, this was a group effort
I prefer not to call them Norwegian, danish or Swedish vikings
Because it's all complicated with tribes and ancestors so I just call them Scandinavian vikings
I have heard these vikings being claimed as danish, Norwegian and Swedish
I hear that many monks were saved by the vikings and brought back to scandinavia where the vikings also helped them find work
"Vikings save treasures from monastery after monks die in hatchet-related incident"
The first episode or two, with all the stuff about travelling to an unknown land, is just so stupid
They knew fucking well that England was there
Danes had already visited in preceding years
It's not like Columbus crossing the Atlantic
Otherwise it's really well done
*You had some very bad people in that group, but you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides
Didn't they also make Roskilde Fjord look like it was surrounded by mountains
yeah, Lindisfarne is 793, but the first attack was in 787 already
Just not as impactful, and, more importantly, there wasn't a fucking chronicler present
Also, this is interesting:
>In fact, Lindisfarne was so full of treasure that the initial raid, and even subsequent ones, still did not impoverish the monastery
Eat The Rich, basically
I guess
Personally I’m getting tired of the current trendy Hollywood take on Vikings, and how historical figures and events are changed to Norwegian because it’s cooler
Not true, at this point in time the early Danish Kingdoms existed, although not united yet
The land of the Danes stretched from Jutland to Scania, and the people inhabiting them where referred to as Danes, also in the Anglo-Saxon chronicles
At least they made the location ambiguous by calling it "Kattegat" - feels a bit silly, but I can live with it
Wait, I wasn't the only one who was triggered by the blatant  Danish/Norwegian conflation
Them saying Kattegat with that super sharp accent all the time made me smile, tbh
It was fun
The word *is* derived from Dutch, being named by Dutch sailors
The Kattegat is a stretch of sea with many narrow passages, and at some times the navigable path through the Kattegat was less than 4 kilometers wide
Thus, it was considered a passage so tight that only a cat could pass through easily
Nowadays, it's one of the busiest waterways in the world

The former prime minister of Denmark sent a message to Donald Trump as a response to Trump's way of handling his loss
Guess we'll see another war in Syria, Ukraine as well as a jihadi caliphate in Caucasus then
Congratulations on a great voter turnout, and a democratic process that is nearing completion
As a foreigner, it will be nice to return to some kind of normalcy
From a danish citizen
Didnt realise the US was apart of Europe
I think it's important European news considering Trump has been supporting (directly or indirectly) right wing authoritarians in Europe (and outside), like Orban and the the PIS party, which has been a lot closer to destroying the EU than Brexit ever could
And then there's the hold legitimizing of an otherwised sanctioned Putin and Russia
Thank fucking god, that short-fingered fucktard is out of world politics
Russia's goal has always be destabilization of the west
We can expect them to say whatever they believe will do that
Exactly
This is a bitter victory
Half the country is deeply unhappy
If they’re ignored again they’ll make sure another Trump gets elected next time - and next time he might be competently evil
Now is the time to *listen* to the plight of middle America
They’re not driven by racism, as is the media trying to claim
They’re hurting
Their jobs are gone
The cost of living is skyrocketing
Their towns are dying

We’ve been posting Donald Trump stuff for 4 years
Seems like a Good way to end that tradition
Let's not ask too much, It's the Americans we are talking about
They were part of the UK once i think
OMG what the hell happend in Bhutan
Yeah, Lukashenko might not have a foot to stand on when talking about democracy, but the electoral college / first past the post really is a mockery of democracy
It's honestly surprising, 'cause Slovenia is lowkey seen as the model Balkan state since there's been no scandal
That guy is an embarrassment
I don't mind Republicans, if they can produce an actual sane candidate
I never had any issue with McCain or Romeny
Both btw, were the only consistant critics of Trump on the Republican bench during these last years
We can tell half the country voted for Trump
If we believed the media, he’s an insane dictator and everyone hates him
Clearly the media isn’t portraying the truth
To some extent, but the Americans don't really ask as much of us either
So it's a concern :(
Who let you loose
Get back in /r/Denmark
It might win him the Votes in the swing state back
A moderate republican (who is actually a successfull Business man and Christian), might be something they are looking for
Time will tell
we might be back here in 4 years with President Hulk Hogan or something
TBH I'm worried of what'll happen without her at the helm
This is basically what the opinion towards the risks in Western and Eastern European countries

I don't get why Germany refuses to see itself for what it is, one of the most relevant and influential countries in the world
Calling the chancellor "leader of the free world" won't somehow revert Germany to the days of the Reich
Nah, whether or not someone's an ass is irrelevant to me as long as they have an agenda I agree with
It won't.
høhøhø lol :p
I mentioned voter fraud because I'm Danish and thus wouldn't be able to vote in German elections

Oh he didn't do it as a joke
Ahaha what
Did he actually think he could just take it without anyone noticing with multiple cameras pointed at him
Pretty ironic, considering they want to join a political entity where the president isn't on election
as a dane i am actually shocked by how low denmark is
Like i get a lot of the others
I don't understand why the UK is so low
But here in Denmark, we use every single bit that isn't forest or a city for agriculture
Is the same true for the UK
Shameful :(
Denmark used to be covered in trees as well
Building wooden ships for a millenia sure costs a lot of trees
So the more trees, the less cultured a country is
Got it
Denmark so small the number doesn't event fit om there
Sweden: nice
spoken like a true dane
Kippis sauna Nokia
Also, Google Earth:
Farm, Farm, Farm, Grassfield, Town, Farm Farm - Oh, there's a tiny forest - Farm, Farm
>What's going on
Are they cutting down the trees to make farm land or something
Old nations
Ship building and farming in the 1600-1700 wrecked most forests
If look at Denmark, by the early 1800 only 2% of the land was covered by forest
So at 14% it's the highest it's been in over 200 years
The goal is to be at 20-25% by 2100 (Raising forests takes time
It used to be as low as ~3% in the early 1800s, which seems even more unimaginable
We had to import a lot of pine to stop desertation of Northern Jutland and to cultivate the Jutlandish heath:
> I dag finder man dog også en række andre fyrrearter i Danmark, visse i stort tal
De er indplantet fra slutningen af 1700-tallet, først for at hjælpe med bekæmpelse af sandflugten i Nordsjælland og Vestjylland, men senere også brugt i plantager på de ringeste jorde under forsøget på at opdyrke heden
Denmark has changed so much since then
It used to be very swampy and we eradicated our indigenous birch
There's a reason why the stork no longer visit
In fact, we've drained so much water since then that I personally grew up on a piece of reclaimed land that didn't previously exist 200 years ago
Probably why I equate the smell of pine with summer
I blame the British people for taking all our ships and cutting all our trees down so we couldn't build new ones after The battle of Copenhagen
Like where is that
I come from Fanø and i thought it was probably similar to your situation
But apparently not
During that time the people that lived there cheated wealthy people out of buying the island
I 1741 manglede den enevældige Christian 6
penge, og Fanø blev igen sat på auktion i Ribe
Denne gang var fannikkerne parat, og de frygtede andre købere - bl
a. herremanden fra Trøjborg og Ribes købmænd, som de i forvejen skyldte penge til
Det fortælles, at Fanøs repræsentant, Sonnich Jensen Møller, bestak en tjener til at dreje viserne på uret i rådstuen en time frem, mens auktionsholderen tog sig en lur inden auktionen
Derfor startede auktionen en time tidligere end annonceret, og fannikkerne fik hammerslag på 6000 rigsdaler
Kort efter kom herremanden fra Trøjborg, men da var auktionen færdig, og Fanø solgt til fannikkerne
Just forests
The goal to make as much as possible actual forests
But surprise, there are no actual numbers associated with this
&#x200B;
I don't much about Danish forestry . But the Ministry of Environment and Food of Denmark have a report (Danish) about the current state of our national forest program
> Like where is that
Frølunde Fed
It's close to the inlet where Vikings would sail up to Trelleborg
On really old maps it's pretty much all under water, even though the ones I just found from late 1700s on  does show it as little piece of land
> But apparently not
During that time the people that lived there cheated wealthy people out of buying the island
> Det fortælles, at Fanøs repræsentant, Sonnich Jensen Møller, bestak en tjener til at dreje viserne på uret i rådstuen en time frem
Haha, very sneaky
This also reminds me of Iceland and Norway
Both places has laws that dictates that about 30-40% of a company board must be women
However, the way I see it is that the law itself is discriminatory against both men and women
It is discriminating against men for obvious reasons - they might not get a job which they were more qualified for
The reason it is discriminating against women is that it assumes that women can't get the job unless they seriously handicap men
Choosing - and making rules, bases on the gender of a person is inherently a bad idea
The person, male or female, has to be chosen based on merit
"Positive" discrimination against one person is negative discrimination against the other
How's the military's loyalty
If they remain loyal as in Venezuela, nothing happens
The country has virtually been ignored since the fall of the USSR
Flag of Belarus 1991-1995
It's become sort of a rebel flag
There used to be these ads run here, where they went to the US and talked about general facts-of-life stuff
Like "how many vacation days do Danish people get" or "the length of maternity leave" and the Americans are always dumbfounded
One that really stood out to me was the "how many vacation days" one because everyone gets six weeks guaranteed vacation and the dude replies "I get 64 hours" - like damn
The people are broken
New polls show that 70% of republicans still believe that the election was stolen
i mean that is just utter insanity
way too many danish people thinks its perfectly fine wtf
It was created at a time when the prevailing thought was "every citizen should have the ability to vote
But the poor might be too stupid and put their own needs above the needs of the state, so we need to do something to limit them
" Most other western democracies had similar stuff in their constitutions when they started out
Key difference is, *most* European democracies changed it because this idea that the wealthy are smart and put the needs of the state above their own needs is silly and also goes against the liberal ideas that spawned the democracies
Great Britain has some similar archaic institutions like the fact that there aren't elections for the house of lords
It comes from the idea that the poor needed to be contained
I don't think Biden would be stupid to compromise with his political opponents if he wishes to bridge the divide
You can't solely represent your voting percentage, which if I remember correctly, was about 51-52%. Then you risk alienating the remaining precentage of the population and possible entrench them further in their stance
I absolutely do not remember, it was a very long time ago
An NPR (National Public Radio) poll from last month
Should correct my original post “new” is not accurate
I guess except if you need an abortion
That is true, there was that conflict back in the day between whether it should be a "confederate" state where the states have far more power or a federated state where there is a federal state that has it's own responsibilities
However the idea of the electoral college and many of the limitations that exist(ed) in the voting process do in some part come from that early liberal point of view that the poor were too stupid, greedy or corrupt to be able to effectively govern or have a say in said governing
elected by Poles
I do not understand what the purpose of this post is
Why are we posting about a single individual that was killed years ago
The deceiving headline that is intended to make people believe that this is something that just happened is an indication of the motivation
This honestly just feels like political propaganda meant to frame a political group as victims, in order to garner support for their radical ideology
It would be the same as someone making a thread about a person that was killed by the far left or islamists years ago
I should note that I strongly oppose neo-nazis
I think it's a horrible ideology, but that doesn't mean that I'm automatically a fan of any political ideology that claims to oppose them, as limiting the choices to those two options is a false binary
PS: If you believe that antifascist isn't generally a radical political ideology, but simply a group that is against fascists, because they're called antifacists, then I would like to introduce you to the  *Democratic* People's Republic of Korea
Surely it must be a democratic country, because why else would they name themselves in such a manner
\*Looks to pile of explosives Danishly\*
It is something that happened 7 years ago, yet is being brought up here all of the sudden, despite the fact that there hasn't been any fundamentally new developments to this case
How did I Justify it
I literally claimed that I oppose them
I said that that neo-nazism is a "horrible ideology". I do not remotely condone what happened to him
You're trying so hard to set up a false binary, which I talked about, where any opposition or critique of antifacism must mean that I support neo-nazis, as if that is only two paths available
I feel like that would be an even bigger slap in the face of England
And I love it

There will always be extreme outliers but the average opinion is pretty damn reasonable
The best compromise is always when everybody is unhappy about something
It really isn't. Absolute statements made about the incredibly complex nature of the world rarely is
It's merely his own bias showing through that he believes such a simplistic smear against his political opponents is accurate
It's simply the way he wants people to view it, instead of how it is
I was referring to his claim that "populism=covert racist", which isn't accurate
Populism is essentially a political method that simply means that you present yourself as being "for the people", which can occur on both the right and the left
The actual figure in the post is somewhat accurate, when it comes to the claims of socialism and covert racism, but it's slightly hyperbolic and obviously lacks nuance
>I assume you feel personally attacked because you support a party that the racist jibe is aimed at
No, i don't feel personally attacked, as the candidate i voted for is a part of the ALDE, which is the "centrism is exciting" group
I voted for the party which has a name that directly translates as "The left", but they're actually on the center right, because of the brilliant naming scheme of Danish parties
If i wanted to vote as far right as i could, then i could only go as far as DF (Danish people's party), which is a part of the ID group, which i presume is the orange (Liberal and conversative
) group
>If you don’t want these labels associated with your party, then you will have to convince racists to stop supporting your party
I think that's a poor argument
A communist, stalinist or marxist would vote for socialist parties, but i wouldn't label those parties as communist or stalinist as a result of that
I think it's flawed to try and define a political party around the worst of their voters
A political party is defined by their political policies, and if they aren't racist, then it's disingenuous to refer to the party as such
That's some scary elevation right there

This clip is not from a speech, she is responding to a question from a journalist
Thats what makes it impressive - Sadly, there is some context missing here, but she is adjusting her abstraction level according to the question, which is what makes this so good (in my opinion)
Anyone can memorize a speech, but to explain it on several different abstraction levels require a deeper understanding of the subject, which she demonstrates that she has here
Thats the joke
Dont nees you explaining it
That's how jokes get ruined
An Fhrainc's Diary
Anyone got a good documentary on IRA
One about the factions and splits and what they all did and so on
Do they actually get any votes
hot take: we shouldn't jail people just because they have bad opinions
Then shouldn't the slogan be "murders in jail"?
why
Italian politics are so corrupt, esoteric and wacky that it's almost funny
Really curious about the title of the photo
“Moloch of War” is the same as “Sacrifice of War”, right
How dumb do you have to be to do a pro-fascism march less than 20 years after WW2
In fucking England
hang on a bit
Is this the same Oswald Mosley who got utterly humiliated in [The Battle of Cable Street
Dumber than dirt, that guy
Nah, he is talking about [antifascistische aktion] which was established in 1932 by the german communist party
IF I SEE A SINGLE TANKIE I SWEAR TO GOD
Josef was just the smarter of the two monsters
He was no defender of anything
In the end he caused more deaths of eastern Europeans than Hitler who considered them inferior
>Victims of Stalinism and Nazism
What
Do you mean
Victims of Stalinism and Hitlerism
Victims of Socialism and fascism
Or are you implying the only thing wrong with socialism was Stalin
Isn't 4th of May the celebration of the liberation of NL though
IIRC the Nazis surrendered in NL and DK on the same day
In that case it's not really a day of remembrance but a celebration of freedom I'd say
So you are excusing socialism, because the only thing wrong with it was Stalin
Please address whether or not socialism is wrong with or without Stalin
Different types of icecream is still icecream isn't it
Oh cool, is it one of those things where people just "freeze" in place for 2 minutes then like they do in Poland on 1st of August or whatever
You defended to original statement
You you like to correct that
Is socialism wrong with or without Stalin
Then stay out of the conversation if you can't handle it
And that is the message when people personalise the crime of socialism
Thank you
It limits the crimes of socialism to Stalin
Which is my point
They still look and feel like monopoly money :-/
"Minutes ago"?
And they are already putting up scaffolding
Croatians do not fuck around
I mean these have very clearly not been weighted the same, but cool nonetheless :)
Well, you know, we do what we do when we do what we do
A foot is still a foot - regardless of being the preferred unit (which is another issue)
UK just might get kicked out in October
The EU is tired of the unstable situation as it creates uncertainty in the financial world
Look and learn Evergreen, look at learn
this is how its done
I wonder what happens if a ship stuck in there ?
I think we all know the kinda comments to this post
The monks obviously commited suicide to go to heaven instantly
Poor vikings, they probably heard about the pattern bold men in Dresses of Lindisfarne
Looks like they got cheated out of some great fun, and still saved the treasure
YOLO :)
Just aoe things
The vikings were kinda like isis
Someone else might have gotten it wrong
The great Danelaw clearly knew what to do, we were obviously benevolent
>kek
It's nice but also dull, depressing and our cities are lacking beauty
We missed out when the rest of you were part of the roman empires
[Remember poor Biorn]
Their "longboats" still need some work
The nature of Norway is stunning but I was commenting on "our" cities
Speaking of Norway
Few things are as depressing as Tromsø wanting to have a modern harbour front or the beton center of Alta
How about some Kalmar Union
We get mountains, you get cheaper beer
Probably because they factored in that only millionaires can afford them hahaha
... you just posted /s
What TV series or movie has the most neutral view of the war
The best representation of what actually happened
I really enjoyed World War 2 in Colour but thinking back on it it also seemed to be skewed towards the American agenda
To be fair
In 1945 people still thought the USSR were good guys that was helping again the bad guys
If you stop a mugger from stealing an old ladies purse, only to continue the mugging yourself, you don't get any credit at all
At least now we know the USSR were also bad guys
Turns out you just replaced one dictatorship with another
I have a debate with a pro-imperial system once a month on reddit and maybe it's time again
Your system is stupid and if you think it's smart, then you're stupid
Wouldn't it be more reasonable to display all the thicknesses in 64ths
In the picture they reduced all fractions as much as possible, so I now have to compare 7/32 (14/64) to 15/64
Atleast keep the denominator consistent
Agreed, but we'd never get them to do that
64ths, however, is an easy change
Imperial is bad, sure, but this picture is also partly bad design
Damn, I miss being in big crowds, and not be scared to catch a deadly disease
Keep up hope
It will be fun again in a few years :)
In Denmark we call them Berliner pfannkuchen
Hey
We also have a donut day
But we usually celebrate it on Sunday and call it Fastelavnsboller
(also they're filled with vanilla pudding instead of jelly)
a piss-pan-monkey
> spam
paté
I know some people who put jelly in them as well when they bake them themselves
I like to fancy them up with vanilla pudding, marzipan remonce and a tiny bit of chocolate
The only downside to making them yourself is the time it takes + realizing how much butter you're eating
The English word for paté is paté. It's a type of meat paste
If this happened to me I would simply jump and let the wind decide my destination
probably directly face first into the  dirt but who cares lmao
Are invisible Germans trying to steal your bikes again
The imploding turbine had broke breaks (as far I remember)
I think modern turbines will try to position blades towards the wind for less but manageable efficiency
I also want to meet Tom cruise
Oh Montenegro
You poor bastard
Well
How do i meet Tom Cruise
Hi there Turkey
Did you call the activation number at the ballot you were given when first issued your new genitals
I’m sure your parents kept it around somewhere
There's no "Tom Cruise" on my search at all
It's a bunch of songs, then a "How do I find my Iphone", "How do I look", "How do I find my Steam ID" and "How do I update my drivers".
Yeah I can’t see our top English search being “how to meet Tom Cruise”
It's quite weird coming home from the Canary islands, to an even hotter Denmark
What we in Denmark like to call a “Danish summer” is somewhere between 18 and 23 degrees C with at least one rainy day per month
On particularly hot days we could hit 25, 26 or maybe even 27 degrees
In 2018 we had around 25 to 30 degrees with up to 2 months without rain
Where are the rainy danish summers I love
The ones where the grass was always green and soft, and no plants dried up and died because of the heat
We used to get snow during all of winter
Now we might get a week if we’re lucky and we temperatures barely go below freezing
Where are the white winters I know and love
I’m sure Denmark isn’t the only country that has changed over the past few years, and we’re probably not the ones it has the worst effects on, but people will look at how it has become visibly hotter and still refuse to believe in climate change all because there are profits in oil
Do they really think money is more important than our planet and her inhabitants
Or are they just so stupid that they can’t see the world dying
Either way they’re idiots who can’t see past than their own nose
Sorry, I didn’t come here to rant but it really makes me mad how ignorant and/or money hungry some the most powerful people in the world are
I hope you’re all getting through the heat
Remember to drink a lot of water and eat an ice cream every now and then, you probably deserve it
Thought it was a great idea to visit central France in my holiday
Guys, my thighs are stuck together forever now, and the crowded pools have created traumas for me
*I wonder why*
IMO it was a meh summer
Down boy, down
Further from Coast
He's definitely fotoshopped into that picture
I'm just wondering
**How in f*cks name did he kajak 5400 km straight on open sea, on his own
Everyone bitching about this but I'm just happy they did a proper comparison when both days were dreary and overcast with no foliage
Is that legal though ? People would be crazy when they couldn’t find out a car park nearby
Some people are adamant on starting a civil war in parts of Europe
I wish Ursula good luck trtying to force her migrant distribution scheme in effect
I think she'll have a better chance at getting China to release the 1 million Uighurs in the camps in China
I’m not gonna tell how I feel because I nearly got permabanned for it on Reddit for saying it on this sub, but I guess you all know how I feel without explaining myself
I started out incredibly tolerant, having grown up amongst middle eastern immigrants and refugees
But shit like this is starting to wear my patience thin
If we let a 1000 in, and even one of them is gonna behead someone, then don't let them in
“Islam isn’t compatible with with European values” there I fixed it for you, sincerely an eurofederalist
They don’t have the balls for that here in Denmark
Until they realize they live in Central and eastern europe
Fuck Poland and Hungary, fuck eastern Europe in general, and fuck Islam
I’m so fucking done with this bullshit, downvote me all you want
I cringe when I hear the terms “defend our values and culture”. Who the hell is threatening it
This is a security and crime issue
Edit:
It’s annoying that in online spaces, you can’t say this without people assuming that you are an Islamic apologist and an open borders advocate
I definitely think that years of immigration without much concern for cultural and economic integration, coupled with a global network of extremism and conservative dogmatism in the Muslim world has been hugely problematic
But plz don’t give me that bullshit with “defending our culture”. How exactly is European culture realistically being threatened by Islamic extremists
Please tell me
Because the answer is usually some conspiratorial bullshit about Muslims wanting to take over the world
Which is not the case, if you look at reality
As I said - this is a problem which mainly concerns areas of crime, public safety as well as the economic burden of poorly integrated communities that are unemployed
The fact that right-wingers start yapping on about “erasing western culture” is a problem in its own right, and leads down to authoritarian roads just as bad as Islamic doctrine does
Edit2:
Please make a fucking argument if you are gonna reply
And let me state it clear: I DO NOT SUPPORT AN OPEN DOOR POLICY AND THERE ARE HUGE PROBLEMS WITH MUSLIM COMMUNITIES IN EUROPE
I am being downvoted because only THE MOST extreme opinions are accepted here
Decades of lax immigration policies and this is the result
So far
Every time you see boats ferrying people across the Mediterranean, EU demanding open borders, etc
this is what people should realise is the end result
I agree that Estonia is probably pretty good yes
I would like to visit one day :)
Please read my edit as I am tired of being strawmanned
I do not claim that values and cultures are not a problem
However, I am gonna object to the “very well defined” group- part
That is absolutely some bs that people tell themselves in order to simplify that problem - and therefore the solution
Do you have a point other than stating the obvious
I said “... without much concern for economic AND cultural factors” these two things are not mutually exclusive
Let me preface by saying clearly that I have a nuanced opinion on this, but integration would’ve have been relatively more easy if
We would’ve had a job market like the one in the Industrial age, in which unskilled labour was easily hireable
Instead, even being a carpenter today is a semi-academic education
My high school cantine employee was even an engineer from Egypt but couldn’t get his degree accepted
If the Arab world would’ve been stable, and if the most extreme groups would not be funded by Saudi oil money (+ Iran and others)
Having a conservative and dogmatic religion has ALSO been a huge problem, because it has created social control and isolated, parallel communities
But one must ask oneself, why hasn’t the Muslim world been successful in having a “reformation” and what would it take to achieve it
These are the questions that in the long run will make progress on a grand scale
In the meanwhile, we should have a restrictive immigration policy and an active integration policy which handles the roots of the problems we are seeing in local communities
There are a lot of young Muslims with potential that is ruined by both economic disparity, as well as the pressure and control of their own communities
We need to provide them with proper alternatives
That’s the discussion that will actually lead you to results, instead of talking about culture wars and what not
Well thanks for showing me the fine art of making an argument
And that's what we call proper outreach
People should not be scared when they see an officer of the law
It should not be that ''ohhh shit
'' feeling, they should be assured that there's people ready to defend and keep them safe if need be
To be fair, in most of the western civilized countries that's how people perceive the police
No idea what's going on with the US though
Do Albaniens like cheese
Some years back a moped was thrown from the stands in Italy
~~Also in Italy~~ And in Spain, a severed head from a pig
Must have a strong neck
That's not good
Switch sides and it’s still accurate
After the 5th kid you're kinda meh and just tired from all the pregnancies
Finnish people celebrating stuff is the best
Get naked you beautiful beasts
I thought you said tortilla
I watch [video] from very famous and only Finnish youtuper in world
He explained in very detail how it was
Been living in Finland for a year now, and I can seriously hear this picture
Looks chill
I love it when cities with low buildings are draped over hills like that
It gives you a much better sense of being in a landscape, even as you are inside a city
Much unlike the flat coastal 5 story endless asphalt human enclosure which I grew up in
"Greece" the series, eh
Tell me more, tell me more
Just like us Danes
We revolutionized shipbuilding and to this day we still on top of the shipping game worldwide
Edit: Not only on top
We are THE titan in the shipping industry
AI is as biased as the humans who created it
Did people forget about [Google Photos classifying people with dark complexion as gorillas]
Don't worry though, domestic bees aren't threatened so we would still have food
Kind of over dramatic, but i get the sentiment
But it *is* consistent
Bees don't go out if it's too windy or cold or raining and their pollen distribution can be sloppy
Humans can be forced to work through all those conditions with pinpoint precision
GG guys
Or a choir
ENYA
This is so frigging gold and tells a lot about the current situation between the european union and russia
I think he's telling her how he'd deal with those protesting retards if the meeting had been held in Russia, and she's rolling her eyes at the damn laws preventing her from doing that in Germany
This is gold
You've got the power to know
Dude, not fair
That's way too cool
In DK our metro has a similar white asthetic, but man that righ there is just on another level
the black marble is gorgeous
The M3 and M4 lines are much more colourful than the M1 and M2 lines, though, while retaining the same overall minimal shape and style
I'd enjoy a bit more variation in shape, but honestly I find the new lines quite aesthetically pleasing
Haha, I definetly see it now that you've mentioned it, but the coolness definetly stands way above the London underground and even the cute Paris metro
Aesthetically pleasing, sure, but those seats that can only fit 1,5 person are a strange design
We actually only just got ours like within the last 10 years so it's not much of an achievement
Denmark
Are you actually European
In general, yes
I really don't know, but on all our other lines you can actually fit 2 people on those seats, so we've just halved the carrying capacity
Now that I think about your theory might be the most logical really
Well no, sorrt, but it's r/Europe so it kinda surprised me tbh
DK = Denmark
Ohh, yeah it's not like we memorize them either, but you just get very used to hearing and reading them in the news and stuff (probably also beacause of the EU) so we just asumme that abreviations like those are countries, and then you can guess your way to the specific country
Sorry for the long sentences, Danes don't really write in anything shorter than two line sentences
Love it, beams of reverence and kindness
Yeah, these years I feel like a lot of things start out with
>This leadership sucks super much, let's vote for something else
And it just goes way, way worse
Mainstream politicians get a lot of bad rep, but I think it beats fringe politicians
People called Romanes they go the house
Pretty much the exact same thing happened here in Denmark in various places,  Danish article but there's some cool pictures) all kinds of settlements and buildings all the way from the stone age to the viking age have appeared now
Restore the Austro-Hungarian empire
The street looks older than the Colosseum
Where are the meatballs
Multipla
oof, I'm not even Italian, but this annoys me on their behalf
Pizza was invented in Naples (Napoli) in the late 1800s
boys
boys
both kinds are amazing
it's rare to find good Naples style pizza outside of Naples though, whereas you can get decent Roman style pizza in most of Italy
The patterns on the Turkmenistan, Kazakh and Belarusian flag are gorgeous
Can Estonia into Nordic
The answer is the same
One of my really close friends is Georgian and I was supposed to go visit next month, but everything got corona'd :(
They are on the Council, but we do not grant them the rank of Nordic country
> Can Estonia into Nordic
What magical phrasing, ven
How goes the Corona Sweden
Dead yet
I was going for the r/polandball vibe
*hug*
We're just helping you out with the herd immunity, giving ya a little hand in spreading it
You can thank our idiots later
This is fantastic
[This one is a bit blury] though
I think it's the flag of Norway with the symbol of Sweden-Norway in the corner, like [this]
The instrument in his hands is a [sextant] and it's used to messure the altitude of the sun or a star
It's for navigation
Edit: You can also use it to tell the time, when the sun is at it's highest
I think that's what he's doing
Norway was neutral during World War I, so no trench warfare atrocities for Olaf
There might have been some norwegian sailors who were hurt
If you want to know the exact moment, then there's no better method
Nah this is bullshit fuck the police
TIL that Berlin is called Berlino in Italian, which I somehow find hilarious
The people i've met from those countries have been quite friendly
So basically Eastern Europe and anyone who stops them from invading that
I wish the world was simple enough to just have a list of “countries that don’t like us” on the news lol
Lots of people buying into the USA neocon driven agenda of setting up Russia as the ultimate bad guys
I think ultimately they're afraid of closer European corporations and integration
We want to join the list too
The Russian ambassador to Denmark posted a [tweet] a year before the last parliamentary elections saying that it doesn't even make any sense to meddle in the Danish election, as the government will be russophobic no matter who wins
I see what you did there
Same for us
I really don't understand how we didn't make the list
We're NATO's gatekeepers for the whole baltic sea
We're one of the first targets that the Russian Navy would have to contend with if things got hot
In recent years aren't the UK trying to take down themselves
You’re just saying that because you’re Finnish
Looks like a road from one of those citybuilder games
lol, I thought it was Cities Skylines
I was just reminding myself to use this type of road more
&#x200B;
Then I read your comment
Gmaps should get a Nobel prize or something
Just drive really slowly and use the parking indicator and gps
And there's no snow here in lovely rainy Denmark
I'm going to Wagrain on Friday, seems like we have some snow to look forward to
Kinda crazy to see when we haven’t had any snow last for over a day here in Denmark
I looked up the density of snow
I guess this is settled snow which has a density of 20-30% of normal water
So let's say there's about 4 cubic metres of snow on the car, that's about one 1000 kg of snow
So yeah, quite a load
No snow in Denmark either
Five years ago we had snow to my knees
Had to clean the walk way every few hours
But climate change is a myth
Is this a thing
I get questions daily like “do you think it would be okay if I just went to” **bitch don’t leave the country
** how fucking hard can it be to understand
This is pretty funny
Have some fricking respect
Greetings from Denmark
I like the little figures hanging from string
Is this a typical room for a romanian girl, or are there certain things that have only been included to make it a bit more evident that it's Romania
Like the little flag or the picture of Jesus
Do you usually have such things
This is awesome
Remember when Clinton got in trouble for using the term deplorables, when she spoke of these garbage people
i wonder, can we make a campaign where we encourage the family to offset the bullies
Fuck People Who threats Thunberg or her family
Why would you make threats to a Young girl and her fam, just because she is trying to shed light on a very very pressing matter
Just don't get it
All
Why are people who don't love her automatically "scared" of her
They can simply be annoyed that she's repeating the same non-points over and over and for some reason she keeps getting attention for bringing absolutely nothing new or profound to the table
If she were anyone but a teenager, she wouldn't be getting any attention
That is effing great collective behaviour from the Belgian public
Good job <3
Roliganism mate
This is where it's at
Well, it did
But I took yours
^sorry^not^sorry
Nordic Union ️ but EU is okay, just need some cleaning up
Dude
No(r)way
In case you've always wondered why "maneuverability" would be important when picking the correct gun, I guess this proves very well why rifles are not always the answer
I would say this is successful training
Now he knows this can happen
Probably won't do it again
Anyone got the link to the video
I'd love to /hear their reaction to the rifle getting stuck
I don't know
Isn't this military (as opposed to police)
In which case they should be training with the weapon that they'll be carrying around in the field
That's a lot of real fake doors
You should crosspost this to CringeTopia
Those are the special forces for sure
I'll just be enjoying my 15 degrees and rain, thanks
Meanwhile France is deeply involved in its former West African colonies militarily and monetarily
Smart
Completely inaccurate; those are pistols, real Americans use fully automatic assault rifles
Richest country in the world
surely you have the money
It's hard not to, when most European values straight out contradict US values
> It was common then for schools to offer extracurricular activities like marksmanship
That's still pretty common here in Denmark, at least in the area of the country I'm in
Although you can shoot pistols it's harder to get into and more expensive since clubs typically don't have any pistols you can borrow, just rifles
Typically you pay a monthly fee or a 1 time fee for the year/season and then you pay a bit of money for ammo each time (just a small amount since .22LR doesn't cost much) and then they have competitions once in a while where kids from across the country compete in it
Honestly a great sport
Teaches you discipline and patience and although not relevant everywhere in Denmark, in my area at least the general weapons safety knowledge/respect is great to learn too since a lot of people around here hunt
It can almost reach the other side
Their Gripens have no chance
Well seems like a good idea
No other countries have fought as much as them
Yeah, it's our newest, most expensive artillery
As would you, if you had those fuckers as a neighbor
We’ll never truly trust them
SÅDAN DET SKAL VÆRE, NED MED SVENSKEN
Of course
Det sådan man holder styr på dem
In our defence
They are tricksy bitches
Just in case
Indeed
We are very worried about the Swedish invasion
It's basically our No
1 foreign policy priority
Cannon taxation is sound policy
Also, thanks for knowing the real reason there
You good
Exactly
The other side was also Denmark back then, and the cannons can shoot about half way across, which is why theres a similar (albeit way less impressive) fort on the other side
I had to get a friggin' passport traveling through Sweden to Ystad so I could get to Bornholm
Reason
Grenades had been used in Malmö and ~~Swedes thought they were coming through from Denmark~~ concerned about where the grenades were coming from, Swedes upped border security
EDIT: [Hey, there's a whole wiki page about it]
You shoot at ships if they don't behave
When these cannons were put up ships had to pay a toll to the Danish state to pass through the Øresund
In those days we had guns on the other side as well - consider it a trade tariff
Oh if they don’t pay for passage through Øresund they were shot down, that’s how you control traffic
Remember these cannons were in commission when there were solely wooden ships on the sea
I thought Sweden had signed the Chemical Weapons Convention
Barsebäck was surströmming all along
Population is around 5
7 mil
And around 10'ish mil
Nope
I think I read that we "beat" them (yay
) by one or two wars
Maybe it depends on how it's all counted
Record for the most wars fought between Two countries: Denmark and Sweden
Vores sandbanke er bestemt ikke lavet af skidt
You mean danegeld
Who the hell is barbaric enough to not pay the Sound toll
Are you saying you have giant rotten fish
If you have a shit, and compares it to a smellier shit, you still just have a shit you know
Virgin Swede VS Chad Icelandic
"Look at the size of my fucking fish"
Im imagining giant canned rotten sharks in icelandish supermarkets now
Depends on the country
Europe didn't develop uniformly
In italy
Sure, it's well after
In Denmark
In Denmark the medieval period is from 1066-1517/1537 so no
Not sure what the period is usually defined as in France, but probably earlier than 1509
\*shrieks in Malagasy\*
> That's not true
amazing argument
you've convinced everyone
NOOOOOOO
What can I say he make bad tea
What happens if they win them
If you want to have nightmares for some time you should look up the picture taken of Mussolini's body/face after this mob lynching
Some British photographer snuck himself into taking a pic if I recall corrrectly
I wish I never saw that picture
This ain't a YouTube comment section, get outta here with that shite
And also please don't wear any headphones, not hearing anything can really distract you
And stop being on your phones ffs
But the visibility is pretty much the worst, it really removed any chance for the driver to help you
Last winter I almost backed into a bicyclist when reversing out of a driveway at night
I did not see the kid at first, he had no lights on and was wearing dark clothes and hood, but I faintly spotted a little light on his face which was reflection from the phone he was looking at
When shocked I got out of the car to see to shout at him, he removed his white headphones to just say a lazy "what
" before driving away
So, to sum up, that stupid kid was cycling down a dark driveway, wearing dark clothes, was listening to music, spending more energy on reading what was on his phone than watching the road and had no lights on
Fucking idiot
Lmao poo bear in the corner
USA are mostly mixed European - more than Europe which still stick to many nation states - so if shouldn’t surprise that US movies have broad appeal
>Hitler was German

It's not a toilet, it's a pissoir
We also have Bidets,  which are not toilets either
I know it's confusing
Better than pissing on the buildings
Yes
[Removed my original post
Now I remember why I don't participate in this sub]
It's healthy you lazy americans
Could be
could be
Well you get a diffrent kind of tingeling sensation in between your legs on a bidet than when firing assault riffles that's for sure
My local newspaper's cartoon of the day was exactly like this
Their ’logic’ is that the pig indirectly represents the HK resistance towards the mainland
I thought the Swedish national pizza was the one with Bearnaise sauce on top
Here in Denmark we put salad on it aswell
Got to keep it healthy you know
Why do Sweden always get credit for this
It's not like they're the only ones doing it
The stuff of dreams
in denmark kebab pizza is this, but with lettuce, tomato and cucumber
its so fucking good
this doesnt look too bad either
Most pizzarias in Scandinavia  are owned by either Turks or Arabs
The beauty of it is that they have no respect for Italian tradition, so if you can think of a pizza I guarantee it's on a menu somewhere
Same here in Denmark
shit jeg kunne godt spise en salatpizza med kebab lige nu
Just moved to Germany couldn't be happier
Dane here, we could call them the summer germans, but it would be a different reason from the russians
Germany be out here scouting for possible weak points, before their next move
I wonder this would look pr capita as this just says there is a lot of Germans
huh looks like the nazis got their wish of lebensraum
I would love to see that
Finland doesn’t exist
As another non-artist I completely agree, I still remember having to draw the Portuguese flag in school for a project on other countries and even that one is fucking hard to get even remotely decent looking when you have no artistic sense at all
That was like 30 years ago btw so the horror of trying to draw it really stuck with me
Det er en død hest
Wtf i was joking, and i got 27 downvotes haha
I tried drawing Wales' flag once
Didn't go well
Yes, it's a beautiful flag but I just can't draw it myself
Hey, I have been there
Stayed for a night when I was walking the Camino
Do you know where it sails next
Deal
Aw, I was hoping for a price chart of black market organs
What the hell is that supposed to mean 7-7
Selling your own organs carries more risk than selling other people's organs
I like my chances
Btw I noticed the other guy also lives in Finland and I'd need someone to go pick up my 78 slabs of meat
Sausage party lmao
That just means you aren't break COVID the rules :)
Can we stop this sexist shit
If there was a group of women scientists in a room, would you find it funny if i called it a pussy party
As a danish tax-payer I am generally pro-EU
But having to pay taxes to transfer to proto-authoritarian regimes like Poland and Hungary, makes my blood boil
I would rather we leave the EU than support wanna-be dictators
What will this men for the average Joe
So the useless commission is going to oversee this
We are doomed
It would be a counter weight to Germany/France too
I hope it didn't get watered out too much
Overall I feel the EU is a great positive force and is happy to pay
But having too many parasites inside the system weakens it
Yeah, there are problems in many countries
At least transfer funds is a good means of keeping up the pressure
I am all for european solidarity
I think it is both compassionate and common sense, in that it is a good long term investment
Thanks mate - I love Poland and the Poles I know
Poland has so much potential
But electing this government - grrrrr
I'm honestly more confused now
Nice to finally see Europe waking up
Nice bait but ill bite
No one is doubting (except internet trolls) that everyone is opposed to Islamic terrorism and decapitations
Despite being in 2020, however, there is still systemic racism towards black people and other minorities and, in case you weren't aware, there are also black people in France
The fact that you think the protests was just about the killing of one person shows how completely, utterly oblivious you are
Looks thermodynamically inefficient
Not approved
What about the people that have a legitimate phobia of plants though
That’s wonderful then
I love the setup
The tidepod nation
It's almost like its two countries
Rip

Seriously, leaving the EU was the worst political decision in newer time
I cannot fathom that it actually happened
I think it’s a huge problem we generally don’t trust our politicians, as it leads to more incompetent people in politics through extremist parties
At the same time you have to ask how you could ever trust any of the lying sons of bitches
That's just Boris

You are right
I live in Denmark, which generally gets warmer summers and milder winters than the rest of Scandinavia, but this summer is exceptional for all of us
Yes and no, someone much smarter than me on the subject eplained it a few years for me
Bassicly when you get a shitty winter like we just had in the area, you get a hot as fuck summer
There is like a field that moves from the north and it rotates a bit and when it hits us with a shitty winter it will hit with a hot sommer almost every time as well
But it has still been a bit more than extreme here, we already got more "summerdays" than the past 3 years i think
Hah yeah or waterbottles for 20kr a piece
I live in København and it has that humid warm air from the sea and the heat radiating back from the asphalt that combined makes it feel 5-7 degrees higher than it is at times
Nah it's just that hot
There will always be people who didn't think to bring enough water in this heat and who cba to walk to a store

Denmark just transmformed from 1 peninsula and 2 Big Island into one blob and a weird ass Island
And we The Got The T royale
No strong opinions about Danes, I see - we're just boring and uninteresting
Looks like they nailed us to a T... uh, 丁!
They just ignored Denmark
guess that’s a kind of impression as well
they really just love ignoring us

When I lived in america there were a lot of times where I'd point to Denmark on a map and the reaction would be "isn't that Germany
Oh wow, I always thought that was Germany"
Another one was when I'd tell people that I was from Denmark, way too many would respond "oh, so you speak dutch
And don't get me started on the swiss/Danish flag comparisons and mistakes
Denmark
It doesn't help that Slovakians call their country Slovensko, and their language slovenčina
"I mean it all used to be one country, so it can't be that bad"
The classic one for me is that Denmark is the capital of Sweden
>**Volapük** ([/ˈvɒləpʊk/] in English;[\[2\]] [\[volaˈpyk\]] in Volapük) is a [constructed language] created between 1879 and 1880 by [Johann Martin Schleyer] a [Roman Catholic] priest in [Baden] [Germany] who believed that [God] had told him in a dream to create an [international language]
det rene volapyk
I live in Denmark and while yes, volapyk is used, I've definetely heard "Kaudervælsk" at least twice as much
(Also it is spelled volapyk, with y not u. \[no actually u is right\*\])
Vælsk meaning a welsh (aka
non germanic) language
Kauder is derived from the town in Switzerland that is now "Chur", so basically Kaudervælsk is just the romansh language
Edit\* I'm dumb and didn't think about the fact that the word had been translated to english, so the u is right
Is "volapuk" an English version
Here in Denmark we say "volapyk"
I've literally never heard this phrase
Gibberish is usually the go-to, isn't it
Volapyk*
Right
We use Greek or Latin for this as well btw
until i saw this post i never knew volapuk was an actual language
Volapyk*
Ain 't no danish word got no dots over no anything
Volapük? Er det en by i Rusland
Oh i see, that was dumb of me
I didn't think about the fact that all the expressions had been translated
Ja ich glaube das dänische Wort kommt aus dem (Nord-)Deutschen, so ist es jedenfalls oft
That's all fine,  but then why just "U" the first time
Yes it was an attempted universal language that failed, hence the Danish expression
That's because Esperanto borrowed a lot of Romance- and Germanic-derived vocabulary directly, whereas Volapük twisted the words a whole lot in an effort to make them divorced from their parent languages, so that it wouldn't be as eurocentric (due to being intended as a language for the whole world)
Haha
Christian sellouts ;-)

After reading the press announcement of the approval, I don't think it sounds that bad tbh
It will of course depend a 100 % on how the rules are implemented and whether companies are able to find loopholes etc
I haven't been following the subject that much, so I might be mistaken and the press announcement is of course going to make it sound more positive than it is
That being said, I think this paragraph seems positive:
> Currently, internet companies have little incentive to sign fair licensing agreements with rights holders, because they are not considered liable for the content that their users upload
They are only obliged to remove infringing content when a rights holder asks them to do so
However, this is cumbersome for rights holders and does not guarantee them a fair revenue
Making internet companies liable will enhance rights holders’ chances (notably musicians, performers and script authors, as well as news publishers and journalists) to secure fair licensing agreements, thereby obtaining fairer remuneration for the use of their works exploited digitally
If it means that e.g. Youtube has to take more responsibility regarding their copyright system and be more active to ensure that it doesn't abused like it does today
When did EU become this piece of trash system
Was the original intent not a trade alliance or something like that
And now they censor our internet
They recently forced a change in the danish law as well, branding some of the maternity leave parents share, to the father
No one in Denmark wanted that; the system is already fine
This is not what EU is for; stay away
Go back to being  trading Union or what ever the original purpose was
So disappointed in the danish MEPs
Most of them voted for article 13 and no to amendments
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
i don’t understand why anyone would want this
I tried compiling a list of danish representatives, which political party they belong to and what they voted
It will be structured like this:

Margrete Auken (Socialistisk Folkeparti) (YES/NO)
Bendt Bendtsen (Det Konservative Folkeparti) (NO/YES)
Ole Christensen (Socialdemokratiet) (NO/YES)
Jørn Dohrmann (Dansk Folkeparti) (?/?) He has possible gotten misspelled in the PDF, not entirely sure
Rina Ronja Kari (Folkebevægelsen mod EU) (YES/NO)
Rikke Louise Karlsson (Independent) (YES/YES)
Jeppe Kofod (Socialdemokratiet) (NO/YES)
Morten Løkkegaard (Venstre) (NO/YES)
Morten Messerschmidt (Dansk Folkeparti) (ABSTAIN/YES)
Morten Helveg Petersen (Radikale Venstre) (NO/YES)
Jens Rohde (Radikale Venstre) (NO/YES)
Christel Schaldemose (Socialdemokratiet) (NO/YES)
Anders Primdahl Vistisen (Dansk Folkeparti) (YES/YES)

I personally hope that Article 13 will mean that sites like YouTube have to be more active regarding copy right strikes so that the system doesn't get abused like it does today
> Who cares about 5
1 million+ signatures on a petition
That petititon was about Brexit, right
The problem isn't YouTube filters, it's that this is essentially pissing on freedom of expression

Policies regarding the internet should not be made by people who don't know much about it

Actually that’s Sweden discreetly surrendering
Norwegian resistance was absolutely brutal, second only to the Finnish
There were a smaller danish liberation Army in sweden at the end of the war  - i presume - if the Russians came closer to mainland Denmark - the Germans would have sailed them to Copenhagen themselves :-)  Bornholm wasn’t that lucky - and were bombed before the Germans accepted to surrender to the Russians

Good thing too

It's also a massive hassle for British expats living in the EU, Which have to go through citizenship tests, now
Sure, for sorting
But I'm not going to tell somebody that I have an event on ''2019 in April on the 20th'' when I can just say ''20th April''.
But then it's just MM/DD, and we're back to the start
Oh, well
Only literally everyone I know
Saying ''April 20th'' here would leave a lot people confused at first
Here in Denmark, it's ''20th April'' in speech and writing, and so, I would imagine, it is in other countries that use DD/MM

Lago di Garda is absolutely lovely, *especially* outside the summer-season
I've spent countless Easter and autumn holidays in Moniga del Garda not far from Sirmione
Biking around the lake is highly recommended, if you like cycling
I've done it a couple of times, takes about 5 hours
A pit stop in Riva del Garda is a great idea, it's so beautiful at Piazza Catena
Other recommendations in the Southwestern part include Salò and taking a trip up to Lago d'Idro, going up from Gargnano and past Lago di Valvestino
> The Vittoriale degli Italiani is an amazing place to visit
If you continue up the small road, you'll eventually get to a little village called Serniga
There's a brilliant view from there
And if you continue from there, you'll go down Via Panoramica towards Salò, there's a couple of great viewing spots from there

The most fascinating and Dutch thing to me is that they remembered to include the bicycle path next to the motorway

How did you arrive at that
Maybe you should stop accusing others and focus on your own history and people
Nazis were German supremacists not some international group
That massacre like many others was carried out by your state and people not some unspecified group
Oh, I’m sure you knew
You’re just trying to make an impression that Nazism was nothing special, that it was not related specifically to your country and people which is a lie
Racism, war crimes, genocide are not unique to Germans, that’s true obviously
But Nazism was
Nazism was about German superiority and domination, about Labensraum etc
Are you denying this
All those movements you’re talking about are some fringe groups, few mentally disturbed people not representative in any way

We've had ***no*** snow in eastern Denmark this winter
It's depressing AF
I feel you
During one of my last classes in December the sun shine briefly outside
Legit everyone was staring out the windows enjoying the brief moments of sunshine before it retreated back behind the clouds
Yeah ... For a week in February if we're lucky
Winter started a month ago
But snow usually starts around mid november
It rarely stays for long though
Winter starts on December 1st
Winter solstice was on December 22nd
Interesting
Certainly explains the confusion
To make it worse I found this as well
> and in Scandinavia, the winter solstice is traditionally considered as midwinter, with the winter season beginning 1 November
Makes it rather confusing when communicating across borders
Nah, we're pretty much in the middle of it
But it's been a mild one this season
We once visited Taranto on the east coast (2012)
We were travelling the country for a couple of weeks, started of in Napoli and wanted to cross the country (we had seen other parts of the western part before) and thought why have we never heard of Taranto
Now I know
Before that I imagined all of Italy being beautiful
On the way there the bus was pulled over by police and everyone checked
The two very friendly young officers questioned me and my partner (2 Danish guys) a little about our plans in Taranto when we said we were just on vacation
I think they were initially puzzled with the answer but clearly realised we were just very random in our vacation picks
As I recall they smiled and wished us good luck with that
But plus side: We got to see nearby Lecce - maybe because of the contrast to Taranto I vividly remember a wonderful sunny day in charming Lecce
Probably worth it all
I was gonna comment that it seems like a rather small town to have a wall around it
But it seems it was more of a castletown
We knew nothing
Often we would research a little but on a 2-3 weeks vacation we only plan the first days and then with a broad idea after that (and a departure day and place)
We just looked at the map - and thinking like people in this thread that all cities in Italy were at least partly beautiful
At the train station when we were desperately trying to get away again, a guy approached us when he heard us speak in Danish
He was half Danish and half Italian (from Taranto)
He seemed amazed too we were there
Unfortunately he could not help us, it was a Sunday and no trains
We ended taking a very long taxi ride to the next city (which was wonderful again)
But in a way I don’t regret it
I don’t think travelling is about only seeing the most beautiful places
I think it is also about seeing the country as it is
I think it gave me a better understanding of Italy
Certainly a more nuanced one
For instance about rats on the polluted beach where children were playing half naked
It seemed surreal
I actually think we had the same logic and it was part of the reason we went
But yeah names can be misleading (Greenland enters the discussion - though beautiful, the name has not been updated)
Maybe you are right
I have not seen it all far from it
I can just tell what I saw and felt
And the reactions we got from Italians
If you wanted me to learn more you should probably have continued the discussion in English (or German, French or Danish :)
I don’t speak Italian

In danish you can’t call the animal that live in the middle east for a camel
It is called a “dromedar”, which I assume comes from dromedary
In the same way the Bactrian Camel is just called a “kamel”.
I am not sure if it is because of this small linguistic difference, that I find it really strange that people confuses the two animals
It seems like confusing horses and cows to me

We have not yet received any news about a second lockdown occurring

Maybe I'm just dreaming of an easy way out
Luckily, all minx are still safe
Those damn north Jutlanders infected with Mink
As if we dont have enough furries up here in the north

Also, Ive never seen danish turned into engrish before

I think its very sad that all those minks have to be killed
I also havent seen any definate replies to how we are going to compensate the mink farmers who I believe will lose their livelyhood and their breeding stock in one fell sweep
Im assuming since this is denmark and no the US, that there will be an economic net to catch them, but its still a tradegy all around
I think the first sick mink were discovered many months ago
I guess they were hoping things wouldnt get to this point
I was sat at home eating leverpostej when Mette ring
'Mink is kill'
'No'
Some journalist tried to coin that during the press conference
She was shut down immediately
Afaik it hasn't made the virus more or less lethal
But it has changed the outer 'spikes' of the virus
This can cause potential vaccines and anti bodies to be less effective
But keep in mind I'm just a pleb with no education/special knowledge within the field
Afaik they’re gassing the minks
The goverment is throwing everything at getting the job done, including the military
Pretty sure it’ll be over relatively fast
I can clarify for you
Almost all mink fur is bought by Chinese consumers
Without the Chinese demand, a lot of this mink industry wouldn't exist today
Unfortunately if there's demand there's always gonna be supply
> Hope this shit closes mink farms for good
Totally agree
I came upon a closed down mink farm not far from where I lived as a child, that shit was horrendous
Rows and rows of little cages
That's no life for any mammal
We started doing stuff with the mink and killing mink several months ago
So stuff was done, obviously not enough
Frankly, nobody except the mink farm owners have been interested in the issue
The public debate has just been like animal activists that are sad the minks ara killed and then the farmers like "but our money
", but nobody else has bothered much about voicing an opinion
You need to shut it or we'll stop producing bacon for you
Of course it's better than the open markets
They actually have very high security standards
But birds are suspected of having carried it in there
The open markets in Wuhan have 500 different species of live animals stacked on top of each other
These are american mink
Army and police are deployed to ensure the killing is done as swiftly and efficiently as possible
Don't forget Xi
But yeah, this is a fucking mess
Not to mention the cruel state of mink farming
How hard did you need to laugh
> Unfortunately if there's demand there's always gonna be supply
I heard today that the demand is actually kind of brought on by the mink industry itself, by having a pretty big focus on marketing, not sure if that is true but i imagine so
As my dad just pointed out to me: the real unspoken fear here is that our pig population will get infected
This pandemic really is the strongest argument for veganism I've ever seen
>There's a demand for human kidneys but as far as I am aware Denmark doesn't farm them
China does though, so your argument falls short
As long as humans are greedy, demand will cause supply
Lmao get Down from your High horse
Let’s not forget that uk (assuming from your username) is the second largest arms trader in the world

No, our prime minister ordered that all mink farms be turned into cotton candy factories where the mink are free to eat as much as they want

One could even call it arrogant
They say it's about losing sovereignty and being controlled by laws and (to-some-extent) unelected bureaucrats, yet you know better than to take people for what they say at face value and instead contribute negative attributes to the British people in general
But I guess just like a thief thinks everyone steals, so do a Xenophobe think everyone else is a xenophobe

For Denmark, roughly 70 % of the renewable power generation is wind and solar
The 30 % is biomass, biogas and waste incineration
Fuck you, Polan
Poland get a damned grip
Look at that sexy Denmark graph
Now that's rapid improvement
Edit: Props to Lithuania for an equally crazy graph
The waste incineration is not counted as renewable
Unfortunately
Even if the power comes from coal, carbon emmissions are still lower because EV cars are more energy efficient
Plus EV cars don't pollute the cities
Really
I thought the seas around Ireland were way too deep
There is of course floating turbines in development but they are still an expensive option
Isn't land wind much more feasible in Ireland
Denmark has the advantage that most of the seas are shallow

It emits carbon but would have emitted that carbon too if it was spread out in the manure
That accounts for roughly 10 % of the Danish renewable power generation
How is it like in Switzerland
I understood it that Switzerland imports energy from neighboring countries during their nightly off-peak hours for their hydro-storage
Which not complaining, is a great way to minimize electricity waste
Yes
I only counted biodegradable waste which does count as renewable
It has around the same share as non biodegradable waste in electricity production
It goes:
* Solar: 3,4 %
* Wind: 67 %
* Straw: 2,7 %
* Wood (mostly imported): 19,2 %
* Biodegradable waste: 4 %
* Biogas: 3,1 %
edit: non renewables (the ~30%):
* Oil: 3,1 %
* Natural gas: 21%
* Coal: 68,1 %
* Waste: 7,9 %
Figures from 2017
Yes, they have very strict emmissions regulations
In Copenhagen, they are installing an artificial ski slope on the newest one, so you obviously can't emit toxic exhaust gas there
Yeah, [those are Swedish actually]
Replacing natural gas with coal is not exactly the way forward
You do realise that Denmark has an incredibly high share of renewable, and it was done in the span of only a couple of decades from nearly nothing to 70%.
Demmark is flat as hell, so that excuse does not work for the Netherlands, as Denmark has proven that it's still possible regardless
It's harder, but it's not impossible
Yes it does, my bad
Well there are on the Danish side as well but the Øresund link is under water when driving past that so what are you gonna do
Sure there are losses in the battery, but engine losses in a ICE is around 60 %. All that heat just gets wasted
In the Netherlands, I'm sure there are district heating systems associated with coal plants
Transmission losses are small, maybe around 2-3 %. You need a lot more energy to transport fuel around in trucks than you loose energy in a high voltage cable
> That being said I'm all for EVs regardless of where the energy comes from right now
If there is no demand for more electric energy and less liquid fossil fuels then there is less demand to invest more into EVs which means there is less demand for less liquid fossil fuels etc pp
That chicken and egg problem can only be solved by attacking it from both sides
I agree
> while mineral fuel exports are the fastest growing export in Denmark
Is it really
Our North Sea oil and gas production is going down rapidly
From almost 25 million cubic meters in 2005 to below 10 today
I don't think you would need to share the oil fund
You would just need to contribute relative to your GNI
Yes
But the infographic is about EU countries
If there were one on Mediterranean countries would you demand Finland to be included too
But this graph doesn't count power imported from other countries, only power generated
So what we import is irrelevant
It's true that interconnections with Norway and Sweden will be important in the years to come when we face out some of the thermal plants
But it's not a problem reaching ~50% wind without hydro
The reason we import from Norway is the price
It's often cheaper than what our gas and biomass plants can deliver, especially during the summer
That makes 0 logical sense
Denmark has no mountains and gets almost no power from hydro, we rely heavily on wind and sun
We are jealous of Norway’s mountains
In Denmark we have the problem that windmills produce a lot of power during the night which we don’t use so we sell it very cheap to Norway who use that power to pump water up which they later sell to Denmark at normal price
This
Otherwise Denmark would also show some reliance on the nuclear we import from Sweden
Energinet (the company in charge of the electrical grid) have a nice live display of how the grid looks
Right now we are importing 1000 MW (roughly 25%), but that is basically because of the price
It is cheeper the buy hydro and nuclear than producing it with gas or coal
But
Norway is in the European Economic Area, meaning you have to follow the laws that the EU enforces
AFAIK it's mainly the fishing policies and the insane membership fee because of your high GNP per capita that makes you not wish to join
The subsidiary price for the windmills and solar cells for the 269 MW that was planed in 2018 had an avarage of 10% of electricity price
With the windmills being the lowest subsidiaries
Op,have you seen people in Denmark
*Notices Sweden has a slighter darker shade*
Swedes are all just a bunch of fatties, who could learn a thing or two from the fit Danish Chads
Yes, these statistics were made by OP looking at people
Wdym
People are hella fat in Denmark
Apparantly most other european countries are fatter
Danes are fatter than most of these nations that are in orange
And you base that on what
Seeing fat where you live
Just overall
Why do we have 80-year-olds in politics
It's so absurd to me
It's even worse in the USA when you see senators with canes
Jesus Christ
Earn 29
1% more money, HAH
Spend 67
22% more money on healthcare, oh
All that shit about Denmark during the presidential campaign is over
We Danes can finally relax and let Sweden deal with the hassle of explaining the difference between - I may have heard it from somewhere, so it must be the truth - and plain old verifiable facts
Enjoy Sweden
9 out of 10 times you are wasting your time
They are not listening to reason
Denmark is also pretty extreme tbh
The site isn't drawing correct data from some of its sources
It claims to be sourcing GDP per capita data from the CIA factbook, but a closer examination shows that the data is either a decade out of date or gotten elsewhere, none of the recent data sheets on CIA factbook show the same data as what this site is showing
Does this also count the black and hispanic communities in the US
Homeless people don't use a lot of electricity
Thats calculated on the total spending on health care actually both from the state and private people, so much for paying for healthcare through taxes being more expensive
> electricity
Norway has, essentially, free electricity from massive dams
Accordingly, they use it for a lot of things where others might use gasoline or diesel
I did the same (also in Denmark)
But for rich countries the demand for energy is pretty much inelastic (demand doesn't really react to changes in price)
I earn enough money not to care
I'd rather be warm and pay whatever that costs
I'm from Florida, so I keep all my radiators on max :P
I think what will make an impact is once the distributor can send pricing signals to the home and appliances can respond accordingly (start washing clothes or charging electric car at night when price is lowest)
I'm pretty sure you also have a specific shortage of doctors, at least from anecdotal evidence
I know a bunch of people who have come out of med school, went to Norway for a year or two and come back with what can almost buy a house
This is what would happen if the architects if the rebuild are all american lol
If you really want to increase the amount of church goers in the world this is a decent option
I’m scared
I suppose if history books are given the same value as whatever someone writes online, because it is "just something someone wrote" it is quite scarily easy to believe that this is happening
How
IT'S NOT NORMAL
Walking 2 km in business clothes and shoes is not fun
Can we please have our clouds and 15 degress back
Sooo warm
At 7am
when I walked to the bus it was 15c...
Currently sitting naked with all windows open, because there is no wind, so the warmth isn't being pushed out
Good
Keep it up swede
It's hot and uncommon for a country located 1/3 into the Arctic Circle
There's cold parts of the planet too, you know
Another contender
This bridge goes between Norway and Sweden at Morokulien:
Danish banknotes all feature bridges on them :)
Ironically, the entire thing is located just on the Hungarian side of the border
Why aren't they slav squatting
Fucking disgusting
Working on my knees with kneepads is uncomfortable, can't imagine doing it a whole day
Germans seems to be quite sensible people
It's almost as if they trust people close to them more
Yeah - I was applauding the german common sense ;-) Now at least
(Sure been a busy century for you guys
Like in most dictatorships it was probably driven by internal politics
Ironically - Dictators have to try and keep their internal popularity up
I say we invade America and install a puppet regime
Fuck up free speech
How is free speech fucked up
Article 17 - Right to property
Everyone has the right to own, use, dispose of and bequeath his or her lawfully acquired possessions
No one may be deprived of his or her possessions, except in the public interest and in the cases and under the conditions provided for by law, subject to fair compensation being paid in good time for their loss
The use of property may be regulated by law in so far as is necessary for the general interest
Intellectual property shall be protected
Can you explain what you mean by "free speech is fucked up"? So far you haven't explained what you mean
It's like many of these big companies will go to any length to not have to pay taxes and to ignore regulations
And yet, when they're fined, there's still a bunch of people who are more than happy to defend these assholes
Pay your taxes and follow the rules
It's disgoosting
And they went "m'kay, the fines are still lower than the taxes we never paid
Sad to see her take a step back from national politics, but she is really having an impact where she is now
Margrethe is my gal
Super proud of her - she's done such an amazing job in the commission
She was the leader of my political party, before she became a commissioner
She's insanely competent, she's an incredibly nice woman in person, and I obviously agree with her on most issues
Not to mention that they only get fined for the tax evasion that gets caught
Well, I do vote Radical Left in the elections
Though with the upcoming election I'll have to refamiliarize myself with their current political stance
Just a heads up, we're known as the Danish Social Liberal Party, in English
"Radical Left" is pretty misleading, when you're not familiar with the particular historical meaning it has here
B are more to the left than A these days ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
Edit: changed S to A. My bad
Really
I didn't know that
I don't really mind
I've never been overly sympathetic with A.
The Letters is a way to make counting votes easier if parties have similar sounding names its, counting is faster when votes go to A and B than when they go to Socialdemokratiet and Radikale Venstre
It also makes party focused election election posters much easier as you just put your Letter in you party colors on it and basically everyone knows who its for
Me neither
Claims to have some decent values but their policies don't hold up at all
I'll take them any day over the alternative though (DF and Liberal Alliance as a part of the government *shudders*)
Agreed
Very interesting&mdash;this reminds me of a similar pond known as Devils Hole located in Death Valley
> Devils Hole is a window into this vast aquifer and an unusual indicator of seismic activity around the world
Large earthquakes as far away as Japan, Indonesia and Chile have caused the water to 'slosh' in Devils Hole like water in a bathtub
Waves may spash as high as two meters up the walls [...]
Here's a link to the YouTube video that shows how earthquakes happening at remote locations can cause slushing of the water:
What's scary is that the Devils Hole is more than 150m deep and the bottom has never been mapped
And it has also taken the life of a diver, who went in under the darkness of the night in 1965, only to never emerge (only his diving goggles were ever found):
In pissed denmark is gone
But happy we got skåne back
I think most of my fellow Danes are perfectly fine with ignoring, and being ignored by, the outside world
As a Dane I am enraged beyond belief
as a dane i am offend that germany owns holstein
Else then that it looks better than ever
Maybe not calling norwegians after a traitor to humanity
Really had to do is Danes like that, huh
Denmark is just gone
I am deeply triggered
I accept losing almost our entire land mass just to spite the Swedish by taking Skåne back
F u regards Denmark
You've succeeded
I really don't want Malmø.
I have to agree
I looked at this map and thought it had to have been made by a swede
But there's a lot of clever details and a good sense of humour, so that idea seems quite impossible
I feel that lol
When swedes and norwegians insult danish people, they call them "danish devil".
When danish people insult norwegian people, they call them "mountain monkey"
When danish people insult swedish people, they call them "swede".
There's literally no word that is a worse insult for swedish people than "swede". I see nothing wrong with the map
Stop threatening to return Skåne to us, and just do it you pussies
Either that or admit you secretly love Skåne and wish all of Sweden could be like it
I feel its a terrible deal
The only thing better than cheap beer is free beer
And Denmark :)
Well, we're quite good with submarines in Denmark, lots of
enthusiasts
I say Denmark prepared for climate change and went full Atlantis
Everybody in Scandinavia adores Finland
You drink booze, freeze your ass of and eat shitty food like the rest of us in Scandinavia - and you fought the Russians like men
You got to respect that
Well, Denmark also worked willingly with the Nazis
at least until 1943, when our grand coalition government stepped down because they refused to introduce the death penalty
As a Dane, I’d say that’s fair :-)
Funny enough, we Danes also always joke about Skåne (and Halland, and Blekinge) being a part of Denmark
Yeah, i noticed after my post that Skåne in Sweden was marked as Denmark
That's likely to be a slight against the swedes than Danes
Or both perhaps
For some map makers Denmark seems to be this small detail on top of Germany that you can just skip for, I don't know, artistic reasons
Or space reasons
I assume it's the same people who skip Malta and Iceland

Making a campfire is fun, burning a pile of rubber tires is just stupid
I think it's more a matter of blowing out pointless greenhouse gasses rather than fuel shortage
**Edit (a bit long, sorry):** Wow, this really upset some of you
I just want to add some more nuance to my comment
First of all, I was just pointing out that I think the first comment was talking about climate change rather than fuel shortage
I'm personally not bothered by this particular flight exhibition, but if there was a vote to do it or not, I would probably vote don't.
A lot of you are commenting "one flight wont change anything" and while that is technically true, it's also false in the long run
I think it's good to be mindful of stuff like this
Sure, substituting your ground beef for beans isn't singlehandedly saving the world, but we all need to work together to be able to send a message where it really has a meaning
Think of it as the butterfly effect: maybe your bean bolognese you serve for your friends is so awesome you inspire them to try experimenting with veggies themselves
More people reduce their meat consumption and now the beef industry needs to find a new product, so they start making veggie burgers instead
"*That's ridiculous
"* you might think, but it's actually happening in Denmark currently: Danish Crown (largest meat company in the country) launched a meat-veggie hybrid in 2019, and Arla (largest dairy company in northen europe) launched an oat milk last year
Pretty sure we can strike a balance and this is way off to the pointless side of that golden mean

It’s metaphorical

This looks like the place the music video for "Stereo Love" was recorded

For some reason I remember the top photo
There was a bomb scare by a drunk last year, right
Yesterday my WoW raid was postponed by 5 minutes as the Dutch people in the guild were taking part in the moment of silence
Being Danish I’ve never experienced anyone remembering WWII like that, and it honestly made me grateful for how lightly my country got out of it
> Is today the date that the Netherlands were liberated
The surrender of German forces in the Netherlands, northwestern Germany, and Denmark was announced on the evening of May 4, effective by 8AM May 5
Why is Germany separate from EU
My Serbian family who lives in small villages thinks the EU is devil incarnate
It’s absolutely shocking how much the EU is despised
I’m legit laughed at when I say I’m Pro-EU
I think because they're a candidate for EU membership
It should eventually pay off, given how much faster eastern European economies are growing, compared to ours
That was the idea, at least
The problem however, is corruption and the fact that Serbia isn't a functional democracy even now when we have the tools to discipline them
I'm afraid what they'll be like if we admit them to the Union and lose all control over them
Hungary or Bulgaria will probably be beacons of human rights and fiscal discipline compared to Serbia
Basically, we should go back to each country complying with the Copenhagen agreement criteria before they're given a single penny
Especially if we're talking about western Balkans which is collectively worthless
Freedom House says Serbia isn't a functional democracy and the corruption index puts it off the charts
Sorry if the facts trigger you
Don't listen to all that Russian and Chinese propaganda
That area used to be working class and the bars lining the canal were filled with sailors and prostitutes
Today it is a highly gentrified tourist trap
Ive been to copenhagen, but never in this part
damn
If you like copenhagen
You should try and take a look at South Funen
It's filled with small islands and lots of beatiful nature
Most of the cities are old trading/fishing cities
Copenhagen is definitely my favorite place I've ever been or lived and I miss it so so much
"You're not helping
" is exactly what I thought when I saw this post haha
Thanks for visiting
Come back soon
Copenhagener here
I agree Copenhagen is beautiful but this is a photo of the classic tourist trap Nyhavn
It blows my mind that if you google Copenhagen, you will just get 500 images of that street
[This] and [this] is what local Copenhagen actually looks like
I bike through there every day to work
Have often had to stop and take photos when the light or the life there is particularly special
As a former resident: Yes they do
You travel the world and rarely find places you would rather live
Notice “live” not just visit
There are plenty of places that are more exciting, but Copenhagen is just and incredible city to live in
I live just outside Copenhagen
It’s not that inhabitants of cities like this doesn’t know the beauty of the city
But the nice parts of a city, at least in the case of Copenhagen, are just mainly tourist areas and horrible expensive
Therefore locals rarely visit, and as you see more areas of the city, you realize there are far more ugly areas than nice like the area displayed in the picture
Therefore it gets harder to acknowledge the beautifulness of a city, because you are basically never there
That’s at least how I feel about it
This area is called “ny havn” (pronounced nu hawn, means new harbor) I pass by it everyday on my bike going to work
There’re always tourists in the area wanting to ride a tour boat, eating at the restaurants (colored buildings, top of them is residential), or famous people making commercials
Last month I accidentally passed by Mads Mikkelsen (the guy that whipped James Bond’s balls in Casino Royal) shooting a commercial
I was inches away from him on my bike path
In Denmark we have a modest culture so we see famous people as normal & respected humans as us
Specially if they’re Nordic
We really do
I don't live in the center but it takes me 20 minutes on a bike to get there
At any rate I love Copenhagen, weather and all
Every year (except for this crazy 2020
) when I go to the Mediterranean over summer, I find myself missing my city after a couple of weeks
> Copenhagen's landmarks
Christania is probably the second most visited place after Tivoli
Countries in the EU can veto alot of decisions, Denmark is often the “let’s rethink this shit guys
” Person at the party
Yes and no, we don’t really have mutch influence, but whenever we do somthing we scream out what we did
But we are pretty far along when looking at the green energy and social help stuff
Very true
Not very low temperatures but high humidity and windy af
Rivers in Denmark
Not according to any geography book published in Denmark in forever
No mountains, so no real seasonal fluctuations in waterlevels from melting snow, and the streams that do exist are too shallow to allow ocean going vessels under power to navigate them
So a river in Denmark is considered a larger body of water than exists in this land where no point is further away from the ocean than 50 kilometers
What we have is an å (stream, creek), but we do not have a flod (river)
Rivers
In Denmark
HAH
At most, historically, Denmark has had a lot of inlets
Like with Trelleborg near Slagelse, back in the day when the sea level was a bit higher
Nah, strøget
Very few Danes come to Nyhavn for Nyhavn
Most Danes are passing through or just sitting at the canal
I don't know any Danes who would eat there
Kinda depends on the neighborhood
I live in a concrete block surrounded by other concrete blocks
Quite drab and dreary
Never in my life could I afford the pictures neighborhood
Fårup Sommerland
It's not a landmark in Copenhagen
Don't beat yourself up, Fårup Sommerland is awesome too
Fond memories going there as a kid
Good luck this summer, then
We don't hate Norway, Only Sweden
Everybody here loves Norway
We adore our little mountain monkeys
I love all my Scandi brethren <3
To be fair Sweden has really nice neighbours
We don't hate Norway
Only Sweden
I didn't know I was supposed to hate Norway
Nice try, but we all just hate sweden
Danes do not hate Norwegians
Denmark and Sweden both love Norway more or less, it's actually one of the things in the world we can actually agree on
^^^Finland ^^^is ^^^not ^^^Scandinavia
Norway and Denmark are united in hating sweeden
Idk what this is, but it's very wrong
**Norway:** The hot (and rich) chick that both Denmark and Sweden wants to date
**Denmark:** Norway's ex
Has been in many fights with Sweden
**Sweden:** Norway's old friend
Has been in many fights with Denmark
**Finland:** Their quiet, mutual friend
Not really a part of the gang, but occasionally just follows along
With their powers combined, they become **/r/Navia**!
Just to be clear the "hate" here is mostly a running joke
It's more like playful teasing between the countries, while in reality we are very close (not just geographically)
Most people here probably understand that, but I just wanted to make that clear since there are places in the world where neighboring countries legitimately hate each other
As A dane, i Can confirm
Maybe
Denmark and Norway likes each other, but dislike Sweden
Nobody dislikes Denmark, but both Norwegians and Swedes think the danish language is gibberish
Norway and Denmark are both Denmark
Umm
I don't know any Danes who hate Norway
What is this
I can confirm
&#x200B;
\-Zach, Aarhus, Denmark
This is false
I have not ever heard a dane speak ill of Norwegians
Might single out the occasional loony, but mostly we just want to fuck, swim, get drunk and play football with them, in my experience
nono Danes likes Finns, tolerate Norwegians and doesn't like the Swedes
Yeah, Dane here - we don't hate Norway and we just pity the beautiful country of Sweden for being so full of swedes
The only thing wrong with Sweden is that it's full of swedes
Also, they banned fun in the 60's.
Excuse you
1: I can't speak for Norway or Sweden, but in Denmark you start your English education fairly early on
I was 10 years old when I started to receive English lessons in school, but that was in the 80'es
My eldest daughter who's 7 have a few English lessons each week
2: We get a lot of English spoken popculture via TV and other media, and unlike many other European countries that have voice actors dub the original English voices, we almost exclusively use subtitles
So you sit there and watch The Terminator and Arnold says: "I'll be back
" and then you immediately read that this means "Jeg kommer igen senere
Honestly, English teachers in Denmark have the easiest job in the world :)
Mind you, I'm not slamming the other countries for dubbing
I learned to speak acceptable german by watching Sesam Straße, not Sesame Street
If a Dane with really low intelligence moved from Denmark to Sweden, the average IQ would rise in both countries
I resent this (but pretty much)
They also have far and away the best neighbors
Don't know about kebab, but we win the falafel race:

There's also a bear at the castle
Here's a pic I took of it two years ago:
I know this will sound odd, because I was a tourist myself when I was in Cesky Krumlov, but the fucking Chinese tourists were ruining that town for me
They were generally just so rude, loud and obnoxious
The fact that they also arrive in groups of like 20-30 doesn't exactly help the case
No manners whatsoever
At least that was my experience ...
We also went to Brno on that same vacation
Entirely different experience
So few tourists but still an awesome city
As a Dane, I can only say ...
Typical Swedes
;-)
>he blamed Brexit uncertainty for his decision to drop plans to build a research and development base in the UK, which will now also go to Germany

Serbia was ethnically cleansing its population, someone needed to do something
Don't make Serbia out to be some kind of innocent victim here
NATO expanded because the countries that were finally free of the Soviet yoke wanted to join, so that they wouldn't once more be put under Russia's thumb as soon as Russia stabilized again
Instead of asking what foreign policies Russia enacted in the 90s how about looking at the foreign policies of the USSR throughout the 20th century
Eastern Europe (apart from Yugoslavia, because Tito wasn't having it, and he was a hard motherfucker) was de facto occupied by them for a long time
Some since 1917, some since 1945, but none of them wanted any part of it
They just didn't have a choice until the 1990s.
> Where did I do that
After you answer that, tell me which NATO country Serbia attacked so that a defensive organisation had to fight back
Don't pretend you didn't imply it
And none, but who *should* have intervened then, if not NATO
The UN
Yes that would have been better, but they couldn't because of Security Council vetos from, guess who
Russia and China
>WWI and WWII showed which post war actions will lead your enemy to become your friend and which will lead them to become aggressive in 30 years
Indeed, occupying Eastern Europe did not win Russia any friends there
Except Serbia, because they never experienced the reality of it
WW1 showed that demanding gigantic reparations and bankrupting the losing side was a very bad idea
WW2 showed that financial assistance and democracy was a good idea (Marshall plan) and that gobbling up sovereign nations and enforcing your ideology on them (what the USSR did) was a bad one in the long term
Entirely different situations
Russia wasn't occupied nor a bombed out shell and didn't want/need the West to interfere with their internal affairs
Stop acting like they were the victims here
Re: "tangents" if you're too dense to  see the connection that's on you
Dane here, I've never heard anyone actually SAY the "hit". It's just "to fluer med eet smæk".
I think a more accurate translation for the Danish one would be: Hit two flies with one *smack
When I visited Amsterdam I was impressed by how pedestrian/bicycle friendly the city was
Even the area I stayed in which was far from the centre (IJBurg) was well planned and thought out for pedestrians/cyclists
Also the tram system is great
How did Amsterdam become like this
People just got fed up with all the cars and decided to try and change it
Same thing happened with "Strøget" here in Copenhagen, in the early 1960's it was still a regular street (for cars), but now it is a 1
1 km long pedestrian street (and tourist attraction, for some reason)
It’s gradually growing year by year too, as connecting roads are traffic sanitized as it’s called, when cars and parking spaces are deprioritized
By giving less space or no space, and improving the sidewalks and bike paths
Why is it always swedes having dumbass opinions
Live a year in Copenhagen or Amsterdam and you’ll understand
So effing cool

Beans, tofu and the like is a ton cheaper in the UK then in Denmark
I’d do huge orders to stock my pantry with cheaper foods once every six months
All three places I used to order from have closed down shipping internationally
One has confided it’s going to be a tough battle to stay open
A huge percent of their customer base was Europeans from other countries where these sort of foods are expensive

Gosh this thing is making me laugh more than I probably should
They had a lot of exemptions which they would not get back, so they probably don't want to return
Rona
Her father, my great-great-grandfather, was a ship captain
He was passing by the island when he received news of the birth of his daugther, so he decided she should be named after it (I imagine more thought went into it, but it was a long time ago, so the story is pretty barebones)
I barely knew her, she died when I was only a kid, but my mom told me she had a heart gold
All I ever knew of her was that she yelled at me when I ran in the hallways or jumped in the bed
HAS DUMBING DOWN THE UK MADE YOUR PENSION IMPOTENT
Thank you
I have plenty of those, from both my mother's and my father's side (Rona is on my father's)
This one time, my great-great-grandfather, Rona's father, had stopped at a Norwegian dock to stock up on lard
Problem was, they used different units of measurement and couldn't agree on what a pound was, so to resolve their differences, they drove a fat, naked hag atop a hill of lard, and pushed her down
Then they scooped out whatever lard was caught between her cheeks and determined that to be a pound
The phrase of legend is that when they asked "What in hell should we do with this butt-lard
", he said "We'll use it for [klejner] a disgusting fat-based christmas cookie
It probably isn't true, but it's a good story
Another good story, which definitely is true, is that my great-great-whateversomething-grandfather on my mother's side, who had a castle in Normandy and hunted with a legitimate wolf-dog, had his entire face bitten off by said wolf-dog
His servants could only identify him by his clothes when they found the body
That's not even a story passed down to me, it's a local legend in the french village where it happened
Sorry for oversharing, it's just hard not to
My grandfather spent his life mapping out his ancestry, and my mom has followed suit
She was the one who discovered the wolf story by trespassing on a farmer's land while checking out the old castle ruins (the french revolution wasn't kind to them)
Luckily, the farmer was eager to share in his culture
In that case I'll top it off
The wolf-dog castle family originally came from Norway and invaded Normandy alongside [Rollo the Viking] who they shared a grandfather with (they were descendents of Rollo's father's brother)
As a result, they were granted a fiefdom, the castle at Sainte-Opportune-la-Mare
When William the Conqueror, Rollo's descendent, fought the English at the Battle of Hastings, 3 of my ancestors were present, one of whom shares my name
Then, when the french revolution was nigh, the family married into a danish military officer's family, my family, because they confused them for a Norwegian noble family of the same name
The other half of the family moved to southern Italy, where my wife happens to be from
Another of my ancestors was known as the "peasant tormentor" because he flogged a servant to death after catching him stealing
He was later executed, but hey, that's what you get for flogging your employees
I have practically endless family stories, as incredible as they are uncredible, but most of them have actual sources
For example, my mom found our old knight's crest at William the Conqueror's castle, so we know for a fact they served him as knights at the Battle of Hastings
She found the same crest at the ruins she explored while trespassing the french farmer's land
When can we throw Poland and the other putinizing east europe countries out of EU

I started watching for the historical fashion, but the arc about Churchill's portrait was amazing
I also really like that they include all the racially tone-deaf speeches of the times
Like when Elizabeth holds speeches in the colonies
It's wild to listen to, and only fair that they include it
Yeah, the way you mentioned Charles is how I think of the Churchill episodes - Churchill was obviously the villain politically, and he's portrayed as a stubborn old oaf, but we see him come to the realisation about the >!glimmer in the pond being about his grief for his dead daughter
< I thought it was beautiful to show that complexity in an otherwise unlikeable character, and the actor did amazing
With racism, I'd much rather have it shown how it was at the times
But there would probably be pearl-clutching, because surely you can't portray a character with such views and not have them be a one-dimensional villain
And if it's in a fictional setting, it can be used to imply things about the author, *even if it's misunderstood* and based on faulty analysis
It takes writing effort to make it nuanced, and it's difficult to gauge how much the audience need to be told who to sympathise with
If the show is Morally Infallible Protagonist vs
Pure Evil Antagonist, of course they'll only be able to show racism in the antagonist, regardless of historical/cultural setting
It helps that the crown is based around real events, there are records of the speeches and such
Though I do think they glorify Elizabeth a bit, everyone comes across as complex and flawed people
Because they're not shown as morally infallible, it makes sense that they'd follow the views of the times
I'm not familiar with the particular atrocity you mentioned, but I don't doubt the royals have lots of dirty secrets, and anything coming to light publicly would be swiftly swept under the rug
But I think the producers had to draw a line, it's a drama, not an exposé. So they stuck to public records, and if there was a public scandal, they would show the characters reacting to the scandal - but only if they thought it would provide a good framework for interesting dramatisation
I imagine the writers focus on events that give them the opportunity to show the character developments and interactions they want
Historical events and objective truth are excellent for the suspension of disbelief, but it's not really ever what it's about
Something as serious as child sex abuse deserves more than to be a side note, used for a bit of drama before the story moves on
The victims deserve that publicity supports them, rather than just stick to what the newspapers wrote at the times
So I understand the decision, it seems a bit like a "damned if you do, damned if you don't" situation
At least from an outside perspective, I have no professional insight into screenwriting specifically
I get the idea, and it’s good
But this is just too unreal
If this is to prove a point, the critics will just use it to portray how unrealistic the European unionists are
With that said, I like the thought tho
Just some size adjustments would do the trick;)
One for all, All for One
I've just googled OECD and 2060, I can't find the report you're referring to
Most of the reports seems to suggest that the economy is going to level out more, but I'm curious to see where you have those numbers from
I would say more like the UK of Asia
Loves tea, imperialism, has a royalty
Thanks, 2012 seems old, but looking at it again I can't see they've updated that exact report
The only numbers I can find that are newer is on their data site, but they are from 2014
Here they say that the World's GDP will be 267,676,800 million USD
For the countries mentioned above
China: $62,591,470 million (23,4%)
India: $56,348,490 million (21,1%)
The US: $38,974,320 million (14,6%)
The Euro Area (EU16): $26,143,340 million (9,8%)
Japan: $7,887,404 million (2,9%)
So maybe slightly more "optimistic" than the 2012 numbers
One thing is for certain all countries mentioned is expected to grow, some are just expected to grow faster
I'm disappointed he didn't speed up and slam the brakes

Glad to see they never removed the copper roof
The Danish flag flies above Stockholm, as it should be
Also, lovely building
Some new building by the harbor in Aarhus installed a nice shiny new copper roof, and every time I see it I think "I can't wait for it to turn nice and green
My least favorite parts of Denmark and other European cities is when you leave the city center, and drive through ugly suburbs filled with yellow brick houses and flat roofs from the 70's, and then enter the outskirts of the cities where a ton of car dealerships have enormous empty lawns in front of them, and they're just wasting space
The only places I've been so far where this isn't common was Oslo and Cannes
Oslo is essentially on the side of a mountain, in a bay
So driving to the outskirts of the city you go through tunnels blown right out of the cliff, and drive through pine forests
In Cannes, you're driving by the coastline, under palm trees
Also with a cliff face to your side
So it's just so much more scenic
That's disappointing
I take it that the Greek form of his name, *Basileios*, is derived from *Basileus*. If that's correct, he'd be Emperor Emperor, or Emperor King

While in the field, they had been given an Austrian liaison officer named Radinger, who stayed with them on their march back as an official escort

Is there independent TV stations airing news in Poland
Poland and Hungary are putinizing
It's sad
But why again are we sending them EU funds, instead of kicking them out
That's why i like the model in my country so much
They are what is known as "public service", meaning they are obligated by law to be as unbiased as possible, to inform the public
In exchange they are funded largely by the government
In service to the people
It IS a banana republic by now
And the polish voters are cheering
No, they can do what they want - but there is no need to send a stream of massive subsidies to them, which their government use to buy popularity with voter bribes

I wish old people didn't get to vote for something that wont affect them
Because you took one of the most retarded decisions in the history of your country
You even allowed that decisions to be taken by people with very limited knowledge about the consequences
I wonder if the British know that when they're acting like this, they're making Theresa May seem like she the most sane and realistic that they have to offer
They can make of that what they like
What are those "red lines" people are talking about
Well it's not like it's much work to say "Remember the billion times we said that XYZ are non-negotiable
Yeah those still apply
" when May comes back thinking she for some unknown reason has new leverage
I dont know what is wrong with that government
Literally run by children at this point
I mean how can you do this
You are giving a speech and you have people behind you cheering your or booing at you
Then you have people playing on their ipads
You dont have enough seats
You vote by shouting
Wtf
2019 people
Shouting over someone is not a valid way of voting even the Greeks knew that and that's why they did it with colored stones ages ago
It is pathetic
to say the least
You sure it wasn't always run by children
Every time I watch some news from the British parliment (House of commons
) it always looks like a bunch of kids yelling, laughing and generally being unprofessional
Well many European countries export a lot of goods to the UK (e.g. cars for Germany or pork for Denmark) who would of course prefer that no tariffs are imposed to make their products more expensive and thus noncompetitive in the UK market
But that's always rather heavily been outweighed by the EU not wanting to accept the UK idea that they can leave the EU while still retaining the benefits of membership (namely free-trade with the massive EU market)
The Germans will have to sell their cars elsewhere and we'll have to sell our pork elsewhere
The UK government has essentially been saying they could leave but retain all the benefits, like you could get a divorce and expect to keep fucking your former spouse
They've pointed to e.g. Norway who have free trade with the EU despite not being a member, while overlooking that Norway is effectively paying membership dues to get that access, and they submit to tons of EU regulations without getting to vote on it to make that happen
Neither of which the UK think they'd have to do
But no May never had any real leverage
If the UK was given a favorable deal of getting to not follow the same rules/regulations as the rest of the EU, while still enjoying the benefits (and thus gaining an unfair advantage effectively)
Then nearly every other country with sizable EU-skeptic blocs would be clamoring to leave on the same terms and it would be the death of the union
And in the end, the UK will likely lose far more on loss of exports to the entire EU than any single EU country will lose on exports to the UK
To me, as another outsider
It seems a symptom of the fact that big chunks of UK media has essentially been using the EU as a scapegoat for every problem imaginable for decades now (while never giving the EU credit for all positive regulations and whatever else that actually improve people's lives)
So there's a whole lot of resentment towards the EU if you only get your news from e.g. the Daily Mail
And politicians have played into it because it's an easy way to score points to say "Yeah, we'll take back control from those out of touch elites down in Brussels
" Basically very populist/nationalist pandering
Like May was at one point declaring that it was a great victory that the UK could now have their passport be whatever colour they want it to be
While the EU responded "That was always the case, the burgundy-red colour passport colour has always simply been a recommendation, not a requirement".
And then to some extent the UK as a whole just seems a bit lost in the past where it was a great power and an empire that could dictate world affairs
Mind you're they're still leaps and bounds more powerful than say Denmark where I'm from
But not compared to the whole EU
And the way that the EU works, in some matters it requires all member countries (no matter how small) to agree to a deal
Which is why we're seeing a relatively small country such as Ireland being able to impose it's will in saying no deal if it includes a hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland (though to some extent a lot of EU countries are supportive of that point, because no one wants to see a revival of the Troubles)
Another silly thing is this UK dream that they can be free of EU regulations and mandate their own with new trade agreements now
[The EU is so big that for most companies it's cheaper to just make all their products compliant with EU standards/regulations than to make separate versions] So the reality is that when the UK makes a trade deal with say New Zealand, then the goods they'll be importing will still be following EU regulations, regulations that the UK now will no longer have any say on

It's interesting how different the ages are, I am from Denmark and when I moved out at the age of 21, I was already getting reactions from people about being kind of a loser for living at home at that age
Could be a BNP map
There seems to be a divide between protestants and catholics in this thread which mest have spilt over to America
At least as a Dane Incan confirm that I was expected to pay rent and take care of myself from 18
Where are those numbers from
None of my Danish friends where still living with their parents at 21
At least in Portugal, the process of changing your official home address on your citizen card is quite bothersome and there are usually no legal penalties if you don't do it (as far as I remember), so most people don't even bother
I moved out of my parents' at 18 (never moved back in) and only changed my official address when I was 25 or so, so for all purposes I was still living with my parents
Now I live in Denmark and the process of updating your address is not only much easier, but you also get fined if you don't report a change of address, so everyone does it
Money/unemployment naturally plays a big part, but there's more to it than that
In my case I moved out when I was 19 and didn't have a job since I turned 18
Unis are free and we get €800 a month for not living with our parents while studying, which is enough to pay for student accommodation and all other nessecities throughout the month
I think it also have changed over time
I am old for reddit and live in Nordjylland
When I moved out at 18 it was kind of expected
My oldest sibling is 7 years younger and she moved out when she was around 21 and that seemed late
My youngest brother who is 15 years younger than me stayed home until he started at university and had to move
Some of it might be cultural too
I have greek friends who are financially independent (could rent a flat or even buy a house) but are expected to live with their family until he marries and starts his own
Dunno how common that is though
It almost making me feel bad that I in Denmark currently earn more than 1200€ a month working a part time job 10-20 hrs
a week, while attending high school
This is not even counting in the free money I get from the government on the side
Damn that is skewed
> I would imagine culture is also partly a result of government policy
Yeah that must be true
I suspect institutions and government policy shape each other in complicated ways
For example, culture might shape the electorate's wishes --> elected politicians --> government policy, which in turn might shape the electorate again
Clearly not for some of them
Maybe they are the exception though, I don’t know

Erhm, why is Danish Zealand (Sjælland) yellow in development
They’re closer to the biggest productivity hub in Denmark in regards to Copenhagen, and has several large cities and is probably one of the most well-connected areas in regards to highways and transportation
What are the criterias here
Because from a Danish perspective, that right there makes no sense
Northern, Western and Southern Jutland (Jylland) are a lot “less” developed from in comparison, so I dont really get this map
Edit: Also, can you guys start listing your sources on these maps
It should be standard, but I see tons of maps like these on this subreddit, and rarely does it include reference to a paper or study
Lovely Italy
Almost the entire country is "more developed" and then
# Sjælland
Cyprus is more developed
Always knew something was different about Sjælland
Regional GDP is measured by dividing production with the number of inhabitants
So there is a huge commuter effect
People living in Roskilde or Køge and working in Copenhagen will count to the production in Copenhagen while adding to the denominator in Region Zealand
Second, Region Zealand does have low labour market participation compared to the rest of Denmark
There has been for many years an exodus of people with poor labour market integration from Copenhagen to places with lower cost of living
Plus some towns in region Zealand, like Nakskov, have been hit hard by de-industrialisation
Apparently, the map is based on GDP per capita relative to EU28 averages (75-90% of avg
for status as 'transitioning')
But even using this metric, which really doesn't say anything at all about development, the data is wrong
The lowest average GDP per capita of any municipality in region Sjælland is Lolland Kommune, at 311
000 kr (2019) which is the equivalent of 41
802€ - roughly 117% of EU28 GDP per capita (35
623€)
I think yellow is correct, but the Copenhagen area should be red
Best regards from Jylland
OP linked this: [
As a Jutlander I made a roadtrip in Sjælland, Lolland and Falster minus Copenhagen this summer and I tell you there are a lot of ghosttowns compared to Vestjylland imo
cities like Sorø and Nakskov are really dying cities
Yes
What is going on
Sjælland less developed than Norrland
Gimme a break
That's Sjælland, which we in Jylland usually say is a part of Sweden
A surprise to me
And that's where Novo Nordisk is, one of the more well known Danish companies
Not a lot of action, it's right between the big cities of Odense and Copenhagen drawing most of the action
Novo Nordisk can't carry the whole region, and if Lolland is included, well fuck
At least it's nice and quiet here :)
Yeah, it's just poorly divided regions by the state
They wanted to wall in Copenhagen, and then just made the rest of Sjælland and Lolland the other part
Lolland is a job desert, and because of the rail and highway going through Sjælland between two bigger cities, Odense on Fyn and Copenhagen, it's easier for many to just work in those cities, and then there is the north-western part of Sjælland where Novo Nordisk is, one of the bigger workplaces in the region - but they can't really make up for the rest
Bornholm is not a region though, it's part of the Capital Region

too bad many of the monarchies are so close, else it would be cool to have castles in those countries
Is that why you left out most of our Islands
You traitor you
I would, but it is hard when working on such a scale
I have a lot of experience with it, that's why I chose it
Thanks :)
That's kind of my point, the monarchies would be great places to put the castles, especially since there's 7 of them in Europe
The problem i was trying to convey is that many of them are grouped quite closely together
The other one is us
^^right
^^^riiiight
Not a great look really
Yes
until the 14th of April
Edit: It's April 12th
Because UK probably leaves the EU on that date
If they pass a plan they leave May 22nd
If they fail to pass anything they are kicked out on April 12th
Why do people that defend Russia or Drumpf always uses the word muh
Are they cows
The parliament are voting no to everything
I think the only thing they would agree on is if the EU sends them free money every month
It's been 3 years, they have had plenty of time to figure something out, but when they leave there will be chaos, as they have not spent the time preparing
Thanks
They also voted no to staying

That picture is of one of the main tourist attractions/traps in Denmark - a pedestrian only street in the very heart of Copenhagen with just about any and every shop imaginable, from tacky souvenirs to high-end furriers - taken this Wednesday, the last day before Easter, when shops would usually be closed for 4 of the next 5 days, and judging by the shadows at about 11 am

and well thats why
Why
Shouldn't companies be expected to keep a reserve instead of doling out every bit of profit (and sometimes more than that) to stockholders
Isn't risk an inherent part of buying stock, or have the bailouts of the past decades erased that part of stockholders' memories
If the stockmarket were made to remember that there is no guarantee that poorly run businesses would be bailed out, then perhaps we wouldn't have seen this ballooning wealth disparity we have witnessed over the past 20-35 years
I mean look at a company like Norwegian (the airline)
Somehow they've been allowed to acquire a debt that dwarfs their estimated value at a pace of **60 to 1**.
Fairly certain others have posted it, but to paraphrase that Indian investor: STOP BAILING OUT FAILING COMPANIES
I absolutely agree with states receiving parts or even full businesses in return for aid
No taxpayer bailouts should be free
But businesses keep rejecting this and lobbying against it so it rarely happens
Sweden's handling of Nordea in the aftermath is a rare example, and one that should be copied round the world
In regards to the your middle quote, yes, but that's not what you're arguing
You are arguing for unprofitable and unethical businesses to be saved
If you are living well during the uptimes, you should be able to put something aside for the downturns
Your shareholders' interest shouldn't be your foremost concern
Your company's should
It's not just that Europeans are better off than in Africa
Imperialism just never died off, and we've been actively keeping poor countries poor by using the IMF to instate austerity measures on them while also making deals with corrupt governments that allow our companies far too cheap access to raw materials
If everyone who worked on your iPhone was to be paid a wage that's similar to a skilled factory worker in the USA, the price would only rise by 20 %. That's because part of it is already produced by skilled, high-paid workers in Sout Korea, and only some parts of the assembly is done in places like China
If they were forced to pay those Chinese workers 15 USD an hour, their wage would rise 12-fold, but the cost of producing the iPhone as a whole would only go up by 20 %.
So much good could be done throughout the world if we would just tolerate slightly higher prices on products

America going with the swedish approach
Because states count deaths differently
Fx Italy counted all Corona deaths, even if the patients had chronic  diseases or was ill beforehand with stuff like lung cancer
Where's other only count official deaths if the patient had no other  complications beforehand, which makes numbers look much better on paper
Sod off Sweden, go play with your highest number of deaths per capita in Europe
They are approaching Italy in terms of deaths per capita
Especially with Russia not a part of the EU, and Russia being the European country with the highest population
And even that isn't really that accurate overall
You may get some idea if you simply want to compare countries but it's damn near impossible to get any accurate number for a specific country
The social distancing, washing hands, "lock down" etc
obviously also impacts the spread of things like influenza which is very common around the same time that Covid popped up, so you may not end up with *that* many extra deaths since influenza usually kills people as well
You may also have fewer deaths from traffic related accidents, work related accidents etc
since most people were sitting at home way more than usual
So just because you don't see many "extra deaths" overall doesn't mean that Covid didn't kill a lot of people, it may simply be that we've prevented a lot of "normal" deaths at the same time
However, you may obviously be able to compare countries that way to some degree, if one country has no extra deaths and another country has a lot of them, that could be a useful comparison but you still don't really know how many Covid killed in either country
Another potential issue could be that the usual influenza may not have hit certain countries much at all if they usually get it from cross-border movements
It usually hits in the colder months after all which seems to indicate that it thrives in colder temperatures and thus it may not really impact the warmer countries much at all if no one's able to travel there due to a Covid lock down
So they may have way fewer influenza deaths this year for all we know
The problem is that we're working with a "sample size of one" here since we don't get these virus outbreaks that often
We have nothing remotely recent to really compare it to

Europe: "LISSEN 'ERE YA LIL' SHIT
No, it's not
Some argue that they are, but that makes little sense
Their arguments are somewhat stranded on either "identifying as Europeans", "Armenia had somr ties to The Roman Empire",  or that they are Christian
Nothing of it really makes sense
Identifying as Europeans does not make your country European
Just like Americans identifying as something that their ancestors were does not make them that
Using the Roman Empire as a standard for what is European or not is problematic as best
That would exclude practically all Scandinavian and Centraleuropean countries, while also making places like Tunis European
That doesn't make sense either
Using Christianity would make more sense that the other two as that is what bound Europe into a community in for instance the medieval period
Though that doesn't make whole lot of sense either as it would include different large parts of the world while also excluding places like parts of Bosnia and Albania etc
Europe is usually agreed to be countries North of the Mediterranean, and West of the Bosphorus and blocked off by the Ural mountains in the east
Though it is not middle eastern either, I suppose it would categorised as Asian
Or historical
But they are in Eurovision which is what really counts
Just because you consider yourself European doesnt make you European
Especially considering you're in Transcaucasia
Sorry, not European - culturally, geographically or at all
Attack helicopter etc etc
You can't really use the Roman empire as a standard for what is Europe and what isn't. That would create problems as for instance Denmark wouldn't be Europe, but Tunis would
That makes little sense
>The EU and the UN do, along with a lot of other European people
Not really
The only reason why Europe wants _any_ Transcaucasia nation in the EU is so they A) Don't align with Russia and B) Oil/Gas pipelines
It's all politics and nothing to do with culture
>Sorry, but your personal opinion doesn't really matter here in regards to this so
The same can be said about yours
And I think we both realise that this subreddit has an _extremely_ liberal definition of whats considered "Europe" - I think mostly due to the huge amount of non-Europeans commenting
>I mean, no offence but you're not an EU official,
Jesus christ, so fucking what
Stop with the personal attacks
It's nearly half your comments in this thread
Why the fuck would _anybody_ think that I'm a European official, even if I was - this is a _personal_ account
> the transcaucasian state's are considered European due to their historical and cultural presence and whatnot
Haha what
> The view expressed in this server is, by and large from what I've seen in my travels
Anecdotes
Just like mine
>You're expressing your opinion from a Danish perspective, so it's understandable why you'd say so, but the generally accepted opinion is that of what I've mentioned above
You keep saying this, that it's an "accepted opinion", but FGM is also an accepted "opinion" in some places
Just because _your_ opinion aligns with the opinion of this subreddit, which I have mentioned already, that is has an _extremely_ liberal definition of Europe
Where does Europe stop then
Should we include Iran because of it's historic ties with Europe
What about Turkey
Is that European
How about previous colonies like Lebanon
None of those countries are European
You arent European and you're pretty butthurt about it
You "accused" me of not being a "European" official (Im sure there are MEPs that think no Transcaucasia nation is European)
Yet - are you an Armenian official
Do you own the corporate account that posted this
You're pretty heavily invested in pushing that Armenia is European when they're clearly not
>Honestly I'm gonna stop talking cause you're being a bit too aggressive and offensive for no reason

If its the second worst genocide in europe since The Holocaust why havent I heard of it
o.O
Not being a genocide denier here, im really curious why this has gone completely unmentioned in the 5 years of highschool/college history I took
Man, I really feel old now
To me this is one of those events that you're supposed to know about because it was a huge event when it happened, but if you're born after it happened I can see why you might not have heard about it if you don't have an interest in newer European history yourself
And you must have avoided most news stories about the Balkans
But I actually thought they taught this in school, but I guess it varies from school to school
... you know about the Rwandan genocide, right
The only genocides I know of are Nanking, Holocaust and Armenian :p
When I discovered magnifying glasses and how ants reacted to intense heat
You really need to read up on your 90s then :D [The Rwandan genocide] had a huge impact when it happened
You should also check out the movie [Hotel Rwanda] about a hotel manager getting caught up in the genocide

Glad to see people come together to protest against bigotry and ignorance
I literally don't see any "nazis" in this thread at all, and I've browsed for a damn while now
I feel you're just massively overreacting, as I'm confident that the amount of people who actual are "nazis" don't make up any significant part of the population, just like any other extremist view
I wouldn't personally say that I belong to either side, which gives me a neutral ground to observe from
What I've observed is that the far left definitely uses negative labels more often, such as racist and nazis, to try and simply invalidate people who don't share their opinion, while the right don't seem to do it as much
Such an attitude and behavior towards people that simply disagree with you is not constructive in the slightest, but simply creates a divide, as people aren't going to be interested in any kind of debate

I think a lot of people are unaware of the atrocities of the communist regime, especially in Eastern Europe, as I personally have only begun to learn about this recently
This is the reason why some countries actually welcomed the Nazis, as they hunted the communists out of their country
This isn't to say the Nazis were a force for good, but they were the shiniest of two turds for some
There's also the communist rule that Eastern Europe were forced under post-WWII, which were tyrannical and authoritarian, which is why these countries have especially strong feelings against communism
I don't disagree with the notion that a majority (50%+) of the presenters are letting their political bias cloud their rational judgement on PragerU, however, there have been decent people on PragerU
Here's a small list, which I quickly created by looking through their catalogue of presenters on their site
* Anders Fogh Rasmussen (Respected former Danish prime minister and former  Secretary General of NATO)
* James Damore (Fired from Google for providing scientifically supported feedback to an affirmative action course that asked for feedback)
* Ayaan Hirsi Ali (A somalian-dutch human's rights critic of Islam, and advocate for the rights and self-determination of Muslim women
* Christina Hoff Sommers (An egalitarian, who is critical of contemporary western feminism
I would say that these are all decent people, even if you might disagree with them
If your system forces its citizens to give up all ideas of money, social classes, and private ownership, then how is that not totalitarian
> And every time anyone or anything questions the current system, they are thrown in with Stalin and Pol Pot and demand excuse for all the myriad deaths under those regimes
What an utterly ridiculous strawman
No, people aren't instantly associated with Stalin and Pol Pot the moment they criticize an aspect of a European capitalist-centered society
Politicians constantly criticize the "current system" that they're in, because that's basically their jobs, and they don't get "thrown in with Stalin and Pol Pot" for it, unless you're advocating from a uniquely extreme platform
If you advocate for higher minimum wages, then the wider public reaction won't be that you're Pol Pot incarnated
Your statement is absurd
The point is that capitalism is a flexible enough framework that is able to include "socialist" policies like the ones you just listed
That is why capitalism is the "least bad" economic system
Just look at capitalist nations like Denmark, Sweden and Norway that have massive public sectors and healthy social security nets, these nations all operate under capitalism and have been able to maintain massive social programs to the benefit of all their citizens
If you're completely ignoring reality, then the discussion exists on an utopian plane that's disconnected from the real world, which could often make the eventual outcome of this discussion inapplicable to the real world
We have seen several different interpretations of communism applied in the real world, and the track record is dreadful, as they frequently result in human suffering
The most important aspect of any economic or political system is the actual real world application
It's easy to create an ideology, where you simply claim that everyone will have everything they need, and no one will be oppressed in any manner
Stating that is an incredibly easy thing to do, but actually making it happen is what ultimately matters, as that's the ultimate test
Communism has repeatedly failed that test of any system
I don't know how many more beta runs people require, before they admit that this communist ideology simply doesn't work well in the real world
You're obviously going to attack capitalism, but the reality is that capitalism has been more succesful in its application, even if isn't perfect
We could simply look at most western countries
It simply has a much better track record, because it accounts much more effectively for human nature, as it doesn't exist on this utopian plane to the same degree as communism
PS: It's not every version of capitalism that allows for total commodification of people's health
Im not arguing that capitalism is brilliant and flawless
However most of the succeses of welfare nations is due to the fact that capitalism is a very flexible system and allows for divergence and market manipulation to a degree
We are constantly looking forward in politics
Constantly arguing over the best ways to improve society, even if we disagree on the how to do that
The only thing that's quite clear to me personally, as someone who is a centrist in Denmark,  is that communism isn't one of those ways forward
Guess which countries have the best democracies
Capitalist countries
Guess which countries had worse democracies

I don’t think he understood the rules and was clearly not at the venue but commenting from a tv studio
A sign came up - with the winner and the big letters AUS - and he proclaimed gold for Austria
The Australian home crowd then celebrated wildly with flags - and with a tired voice he added ‘a popular winner’.

''Genghis Khan; the Scourge of China - An inspiration for us all
They absolutely lost their rag because a newspaper in our country posted a satirical cartoon of a Chinese flag with yellow coronavirus particles instead of stars
They sent a ton of social media bots our way and were comparing us to Nazis and everything
Maybe the Opium Wars are not something we should proudly exhibit as a Chinese failure, when it's pretty clear that the West was in the wrong here
A great example of Imperialism and profits over humanity
I don't understand it really
They want to present them selves as the heir to the oldest country in the world, but shit like the cultural revolution seem to indicate that they'd do anything to distance themselves from their history
There's a distinction to be made here
The CCP may be trying to built an idea that modern China is invincible, but it has never claimed that past China was
The term "[Century of Humiliation] is a central part of the CCPs founding philosophy
This, interestingly enough, started with the Opium Wars
Many modern Chinese political terms, such as China Dream and National Rejuvenation are based on the premise of China rising from the ashes (warranted or not), due to them not being invincible or powerful
If anything, using the Opium Wars as an example of Western supremacy over China (or Chinese failures), is much more likely to actually stoke a feeling of needing to fend off the West and to reclaim what was 'taken' (Center stage in the world)
The Opium Wars are viewed as either the worst or second worst thing to have happened to China, as it was literally the start of the subjugation of China and the Century of Humiliation
The Opium Wars are part of this narrative that the CCP is building that the West wants to subjugate and control them (again) and that they must rejuvenate in order to survive this

I hate cash
No one seems to trust banks, which, given Germany's history, *kind* of makes sense
But this is misdirected skepticism
Germans even hate credit cards because they hate debt
They have some *really* low home ownership rates because mortgage = debt

There are many parallels with Japan, especially given their reliance on, and domination of, their car industries
The practical aspects are the main one for me
Cash tends to get lost, I forget it at home, change is bulky
Additionally, it's much harder to track my spending
I can import my entire spend history into budget planners if it's all on cards - in fact, my bank does it for me now

Mountain Danes don't count
Ireland says 120 but they have 100 km/h limits on country roads I couldn't feasibly driver faster than 50 on
I want to see a map of how obedient each country is in following the speed limits
Or, rather, the observed average speed
Humans doesn't get any better though
And while modern cars have more features for emergency breaking etc
many people don't drive modern cars
I'm pretty sure most accidents are caused by lapse of attention
Speed limits help limit the damage accidents cause
There's a huge difference between a car crashing at 110 and 200
From my experience driving around Iceland in June last year, Icelanders are happy to drive 100 kph and above on the roads that have the 90 kph speed limit
Breaking distance is at least 50% human reaktion time, which haven't improved at all
And like I mentioned, there are plenty of cars still without modern emergency breaking features
We raised the general limit from 110 to 130 a couple of years ago
The result was more accidents and more people killed in accidents
Yes it is and it's even better in person
It's a gorgeous city and I can't recommend it enough if you're in Spain

If it did previously mean a specific type of beer, then it generally doesn't anymore
Imagine how much longer it takes to have a beer when you have to say “Hello i would like one GARAGARDOA please” everytime you order
Also lajs, humlegranater, grünes, stifter and many more – as we say, “kært barn har mange navne”:)
And if the island is in a lake it would be sjöööl

By way of logic you're now obligated to say you also love the Danish language
Well that opens the other trap card: Profess your love for the danish language or risk being stamped as "illogical" (a scandinavian cardinal sin)
And here I was thinking that isles meant islands

It really shouldn't be lauded as antisemitism to propose a ban on male infant circumcision
Especially in a non-Jewish country
It is child protection and an immutable right to bodily integrity
And they are very much in the minority with that statement
Most health organizations in the world with statements on circumcision are opposed to circumcising children:
Swedish Pediatric Society (they outright call for a ban)
Royal     Dutch Medical Association calls it a violation of human rights, and     calls for a "strong policy of deterrence
" this policy has been   endorsed   by several other organizations:
The Netherlands Society of General Practitioners,
The Netherlands Society of Youth Healthcare Physicians,
The Netherlands Association of Paediatric Surgeons,
The Netherlands Association of Plastic Surgeons,
The Netherlands Association for Paediatric Medicine,
The Netherlands Urology Association, and
The Netherlands Surgeons’ Association
College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia
This     procedure should be delayed to a later date when the child can make    his  own informed decision
Parental preference alone does not justify  a    non‐therapeutic procedure
Advise parents that the current  medical    consensus is that routine infant male circumcision is not a   recommended   procedure; it is non‐therapeutic and has no medical   prophylactic  basis;  current evidence indicates that previously‐thought   prophylactic  public  health benefits do not out‐weigh the potential   risks
Routine infant  male circumcision does cause pain and   permanent loss of  healthy tissue
Australian    Federation of Aids  organizations They state that circumcision has  "no   role" in the HIV  epidemic
The German Association of  Pediatricians   called for a ban  recently
The    German Association of  Child and Youth Doctors recently Attacked the    AAP's claims, saying the  benefits they claim, including HIV  reduction,   are "questionable," and  that "Seen from the outside,  cultural bias   reflecting the normality of  non-therapeutic male  circumcision in the US   seems obvious, and the  report’s conclusions  are different from those   reached by doctors in  other parts of the  Western world, including   Europe, Canada, and  Australia
" (scroll to  page 7 for the English   translation
The   AAP was   recently attacked by the President of the British  Association  of   Paediatric Urologists because the evidence of benefit  is weak, and  they   are promoting "Irreversible mutilating surgery
The     College of Physicians and Surgeons of Saskatchewan has taken a    position  against it, saying it is harmful and will likely be considered    illegal  in the future, given the number of men who are angry that it    was done to  them and are becoming activists against it
The President of the Saskatchewan Medical Association has said the same (link above)
The     Central Union for Child Welfare “considers that circumcision of boys     that violates the personal integrity of the boys is not acceptable     unless it is done for medical reasons to treat an illness
The basis  for    the measures of a society must be an unconditional respect for  the    bodily integrity of an under-aged person… Circumcision can only  be    allowed to independent major persons, both women and men, after it  has    been ascertained that the person in question wants it of his or  her own    free will and he or she has not been subjected to pressure
Royal College of Surgeons of England
"The     one absolute indication for circumcision is scarring of the opening   of   the foreskin making it non- retractable (pathological phimosis)
This  is  unusual before five years of age
"..."The parents and, when    competent,  the child, must be made fully aware of the implications of    this  operation as it is a non-reversible procedure
" |
British Medical Association
it     is now widely accepted, including by the BMA, that this surgical     procedure has medical and psychological risks
.... very similar     arguments are also used to try and justify very harmful cultural     procedures, such as female genital mutilation or ritual scarification
Furthermore, the harm of denying a person the opportunity to choose  not    to be circumcised must also be taken into account, together with  the    damage that can be done to the individual’s relationship with his     parents and the medical profession if he feels harmed by the  procedure
.... parental preference alone is not sufficient  justification for    performing a surgical procedure on a child
....  The BMA considers that    the evidence concerning health benefit from  non-therapeutic   circumcision  is insufficient for this alone to be a  justification for   doing it
Australian   Medical   Association Has a policy of discouraging it, ad says "The   Australian   College of Paediatrics should continue to discourage the   practice of   circumcision in newborns
Australian College of Paediatrics:
"The     possibility that routine circumcision may contravene human rights  has    been raised because circumcision is performed on a minor and is   without   proven medical benefit
Whether these legal concerns are valid   will   probably only be known if the matter is determined in a court  of  law   .....Neonatal male circumcision has no medical indication
It  is a    traumatic procedure performed without anaesthesia to remove a  normal  and   healthy prepuce
74%  of   Australian  doctors overall believe circumcision should not be  offered,   and 51%  consider it abuse
Circumcision used to be common in   Australia,  but the  movement against it spread faster there than   America, where  rates  continue to drop
A letter by the South African Medical Association said this:
The     Committee stated that it was unethical and illegal to perform     circumcision on infant boys in this instance
In particular, the     Committee expressed serious concern that not enough scientifically-based     evidence was available to confirm that circumcisions prevented HIV     contraction and that the public at large was influenced by incorrect  and    misrepresented information
The Committee reiterated its view  that it    did not support circumcision to prevent HIV transmission
The     Norwegian Council of Medical Ethics states that ritual circumcision   of   boys is not consistent with important principles of medical  ethics,   that  it is without medical value, and should not be paid for  with   public  funds
The Norwegian Children’s Ombudsman is opposed as well
The Denmark National Council for Children is also opposed
And     recently, the politically appointed Health minister of Norway  opposed  a   ban on circumcision, yet the ban was supported by the  Norwegian   Medical  Association, the Norwegian Nurses Organization, the  Norwegian   Ombudsman  for Children, and the University of Oslo
The Danish Society of Medical Practitioners Recently said the practice is “an assault and should be banned
The     Danish Medical Association is “fundamentally opposed to male     circumcision unless there is a medical reason such as phimosis for     carrying out the operation
‘It's very intrusive that adults may decide     that newborn to undergo a surgical procedure that is not medically     justified and if power is lifelong
When a boy when the age of  majority,    he may even decide, but until then the requirements of the    individual's  right to self-determination prevail
Yes
Are you aware of the subreddit we are in
Circumcision releases large amounts of cortisol in developing brains which has a negative impact, it decreases sexual pleasure, circumcised men have a higher chance of getting erectile dysfunction, most health organizations in the world with statements on circumcision are opposed to circumcising children
Those are the ones I remember off the top of my head
Well America is pretty much the only first would country that has health organizations recomend it
It's also interesting to note that other health organizations have responded to their statements pretty much calling bs, and american health organizations never have a rebuttal, nor do they ever seem to respond to the statements of any other health organization
Also this is r/europe
Yeah
Have you read their statement
It does not speak very positively of circumcision at all
They don't actively say that you must not do it, but it is certainly a lot more negative than the AAP
Also Doctors in Canada are generally not in favor of it, and even use that statement to back up their view
Are you actually implying that health organizations outside of America have a bias because of their financial icentive to sell comics about circumcision
I'm not sure because that's literally insane, but I can't see what else you'd be trying to argue by posting that as a response
They're not, they're concerned about baby penises being cut up
You posted it in response to something saying that doctors in America have a financial incentive to continue the practice, and that other doctors in other countries don't. Also that comic is depicting a brit milah which is a legitimately fucking disgusting practice
Why is portraying it as such anti-semitic
Damn that camera though

Ninja edit: Oh, and I've been ***told*** (and have not verified) that Putin did it to get back at the West for "what they did to Ukraine"
>people should have a right to self determination
They do under certain circumstances, just do a Google search for it
But none of those apply to the Catalonia case at all
However, "people should have a right to self determination
" doesn't just mean that you get to make up your own illegal vote and that the government then has to care about the results
If it did then Barcelona could decide to declare independence from Catalonia next Monday, then northern Barcelona could decide to declare independence from southern Barcelona the week after that, then a neighborhood could leave northern Barcelona, then a block of homes could leave the neighborhood etc
etc
Obviously that's not how the world functions or even *can* function
"people should have a right to self determination
" doesn't mean you just get to do whatever the fuck you want as long as you make up a vote for it
There are still laws, there are still owners of land etc
It's like when the controversial party wins the election, it sucks, but you get the popcorn any way
That way there's at least some good to it
That would probably make Spain veto you guys potentially joining EU if you should decide to go independent at some point though
Politics are complicated
No Greenland
Stay
That's a bit odd honestly, what exactly do those two movements have in common besides the word 'independence'?
Either way, I really wouldn't count on Spain being nice about any country recognizing Catalonia's independence, I'd seriously expect them to veto Scotland ever joining the EU if it was to happen
And the pro-independence folks in Scotland are generally also pro-EU, right
What a mess that could be

in denmark we are a few funny cities names like our capital which if you translate it right its buy a dock, aarhus which is year house, københoved, which looks like københavn our capital the diffence is one is in jylland the other is in sjælland, and one roughly translate to something legal and expensive and the other is a buy a head, we have a cities named barrels, we a town named taller, blue water is also one, an ironic name my hometown esbjerg which roughly translate to ace mountain and if you know denmark youd know why, have a town named the road, we have a town named odder which is the word for otter in danish and there is no otter there, we have one that translate to beer good, and sædding which is sperming, of course we also have the town named cum or sæd
Edit: also Tim, Wind or win (same word in danish), trapdoor, cage, Paris, clear, oddense (not odense), a town named happiness in danish, one named throat, DARKNESS, Dad's island (so that's where all those dads go), Gram, them not a translation, a town called make out, #Humble, and aother beer one this time just beer place, Monking mountain city which is near stonelittle and dianafield which is 8 and a half miles away from piss lake, hope you have a foot fetish then welcome to foot city, rude which is in english window or the english word rude, fan island where i grew up, there is also  Fokkenborg which sounds like fucking castle and it is suppose to i think since there is a rumor of in people who used to live there couldnt hold back of fucking eachother, also pikhade which translate to penishate, bored visit boring,also btw people talk about that wales city alot what about the danish founded new zealand city of  Taumatawhakatangihangakoauauotamateaturipukakapikimaungahoronukupokaiwhenuakitanatahu

But most Danes speak English very well
It's not really that uncommon
English is taught in all schools from 1
st grade onwards and no tv or film is ever dubbed over in Denmark unless it's aimed for 5 year olds or younger
To call english a common second language is almost understating it
I watched so many BBC history docs and english languaged cartoons as a kid that I could read and speak english before we were even taught english proper in class, I know alot of people over her have the same experience

I suppose the real question is why they have statues of the guy in the first place, no why they didn't remove them due to hashtag campaigns
If the guy had the statues built himself, they hold no actual value to society anyway as they're not really about honoring some specific invention, exploration or whatever
Then they're just there for ego
The same goes for the Stalin and Lenin statues for that matter, and I'm sure they'll get around to those any time now
I kinda wish they had either taken it down earlier or later though, you can't make it seem like you give in to the hashtag mob these days as they'll only see it as a motivation to keep moaning
I'm willing to bet that most of them had no idea that statue even existed, they didn't know the first thing about the guy etc
and they really don't give a shit about any specific statue, which is why getting a statue pulled down never makes them stop anywhere
It only makes them move on to the next thing they know nothing about
If experience teaches us anything about those mobs it's that you shouldn't give them an inch
They don't care about some statue they've never even seen of some guy they haven't even bothered looking up, they don't care about some song, some dance, some tradition, some culture or whatever
They just want power over others, which is why they never stop, even after achieving what they were originally campaigning for
So far Leopold has probably been the most worthy of removal anywhere
Even the actions of the conquistadors are childsplay compared to him
But Bismarck is the guy that wanted to unify the German states into a country
Why should he be removed
I was thinking something similar, but I was glad to read this part in the article:
> It will be transferred to a warehouse of a Ghent city museum pending a further decision from a city's commission in charge of decolonisation projects
It sounds like it will be moved from the city to a museum where it will be put in a very different context than as a bust in honour of the man and his deeds
>and the Antwerp centrail railway station will serve to be essentially a cathedral for this man
How so
Is there anything obvious that will make the average person, rather than the history buffs, which will make the average person perceive it as a "cathedral for this man"?
I had a feeling this was the case
Thanks for information
It seems that the only real connection between him and this station is that the money gained from his actions were used to fund the construction of the station, meaning that there is no obvious connection to him, unless you're a history buff
That's what I gathered from other comments in here from people that seem to know hwat they're talking about
PS: Hold up
If you didn't know, then why on earth would you make such a strongly worded statement on it
Why would you have such a strong opinion of something that you didn't know
This is the issue with social media, as it encourages this kind of behaviour

You'd never find a true Dane enjoying the weather — it's always too cold, too hot, too wet, too dry, etc
It's even part of our old national anthem:
Sig mig hvad fanden

You can use "fint" in Danish too
As a Dane, this is so wrong
It's not inaudible, it's incomprehensible
This is misleading
There is no nice weather in denmark
Source: I live in denmark

It's encryption built right into the language
As a dane, I hate that mute h.
Triggered
Also, the more idiomatic way to say this is "**sikke** et dejligt/fint vejr vi har i dag"
"sikke" is easier to pronounce than "vilket", in my opinion
But hey, it goes against the trite "kamelåså" joke, so eh
Yeah "dejligt" is more like "lovely" while "fint" is more like "neat/nice or even pretty" but could also be more like "alright". Fint is more mild for weather description
Addtional, "väder" seriously, hva' fuck Sverige
Hovedværk (Danish) = (author's) main work
Huvudvärk (Swedish) = headache

It is almost universal for all the germanic languages

þ became th in english, d og th in scandinavian languages, d in german
The english call it the great vowel shift, but it happened to all germanic languages
Weather comes from wedrą.
In danish it went wedra(proto germanic)-> veðr(Norse) -> vejr(danish)
In english it went wedra(proto germanic) -> wedar(old saxon) -> weder(old and middle english) -> weather(modern english)
More of a state of mind, really
the temptation to reply "...said the bosnian" is too great
The only mistake of the Stockholm Bloodbath was that the Danish and Norwegian nobility should have been executed, too
Yea, sorry bout that
Looking up the etymology for "dejligt," it looks like it comes from an old Germanic word - "degelik" meaning "good" as in skilled - which seems to have otherwise been forgotten
Also:
Kunstig (Danish) = artificial
Konstig (Swedish) = weird

Skede (Danish) = vagina/sheath
Skede (Swedish) = phase

Tallrik (Swedish) = plate
Væske (Danish) = liquid
Väska (Swedish) = bag
Don't forget;
Danish: *Coronastrategi*
Swedish:
The go-to Danish middle school German class willful mistranslation (as in it was so common that it was one of the first sentences we learned), was "Der Tür ist böse
Now this obviously doesn't make any sense to a German speaker as it translates to "The door is angry," but it in Danish it is very similar to "Tyren er bøsse," which translates to "The bull is gay," which is a profoundly funny sentence to 12 year olds
Of other semi-purposely wrong German sentences I can remember "Guten heute, Leute" definitely stands out
Again it doesn't make sense - the intended purpose is to say "Hello  everyone," but it is more like "Good today, people
But it sounds great and I for one think the German council of words should embrace it
Danish one is frokost
Nerdonændene er bare danskere der er blevet lidt forvirrede
Eye, the derogatory term for swedes is "svensker"
Sweden has never ruled Denmark
Denmark has however ruled Sweden for more than a century
Hell, Scania (and Blekinge and Halland) has been Danish for longer than it has been Swedish
Well I wouldn't translate "tryk" to push that'd be "skub"
The way I heard it was " Ich bin böse und ich knalle mit die Tür", which translates to "I am angry and I slam the door", but in Danish it sounds like "I'm gay and I fuck with the bull".
It only exists in that sketch tbf, kamelåså isnt a real word in Danish
I don't
Indeed we are Like siblings, dont really Like each other
BUT IF ANYONE ELSE THEN ME MESSES WITH MY FAMILY they are going to regret it
Seems so
agreed, "tryk" would be press or pressure
Press the button: tryk på knappen
Under pressure: under tryk
Oppressed: undertrykt
Tryk is  just like the German "drück".

I'd definitely be on board if the transphobes first target was der/den/dem/des+s and all that other shit
Reminds me of the difference of how Norwegians and Danes google the Dano-Norwegian kingdom
In Norway it's: "When was Denmark and Norway in a union
In Denmark it's: "When did Denmark own Norway
Denmark trounced Sweden like 50 times between the late 13th century and the early 16th century
So, no
So that's what they meant with "abolishing genders"
Languages only need two genders: Common and non
Right over
The utter dominance of Denmark in the 14th century is the reason why Norway as a whole and the Swedish commoners dethroned their nobility to elevate the Danish royalty to ac as their own
To focus on latter battles that never amounted to the spoils Denmark gained, is as willfully ignorant as celebrating a ship that sunk on its way out of port #NAVYSTRONG

Selvstændighed for Grønland indebærer, at Grønland overtager højhedsretten over Grønland
fra [Loven om Grønlands Selvstyre af 2009]
Greenland isn't Finland, and Denmark isn't Sweden
They are literally free to leave if they decide to do so
Unlike Finland under Swedish rule
Formalitet
Formålet med loven var at formalisere vejen til Grønlands selvstændighed og blev indgået med det eksplicitte krav fra grønlandsk side at det var Grønland ikke Danmark, der kunne beslutte sig for eller imod selvstændighed
1 i sagsforløbet]
>Lovforslaget har endelig til formål at fastsætte ordningen for beslutningen og gennemførelse af en beslutning om Grønlands selvstændighed
>Det fremgår endvidere af kommissoriet, at der mellem den danske regering og Grønlands landsstyre er enighed om, at det tilkommer det grønlandske folk at afgøre, hvorvidt Grønland ønsker selvstændighed, og at nyordningen intet ændrer herved, og at selvstændigheden i givet fald skal gennemføres ved indgåelse af en aftale herom efter reglerne i grundlovens § 19
Kommissionens forslag til en nyordning skal efter kommissoriet indeholde en bestemmelse om Grønlands adgang til selvstændighed i overensstemmelse hermed
og dette bliver gentaget utallige gange, så dansk indflydelse på grønlandsk selvstændighed kan højst betragtes som de jure
Igen
Det er allerede blevet aftalt at folketingets godkendelse er en formalitet
Loven er vedtaget på dette grundlag
Grundloven er 170 år gammel
Nogen gange er man nødt til at nedfælde ord for at undgå at skulle til at ændre den
§19 som der henvises til siger eksempelvis at det er Kongen, der bestemmer på udenrigsområdet
De gør Kongen de jure
Hvor meget skal vi gi' for de jure i det tilfælde
Jeg har ret du tager fejl
Sådan er det bare

The idea was that it was good, because they were poor people from the working class that usually tried to steal from evil corporations and rich bankers who themselves had gotten their money in less than honest ways
And usually it ended up with both parties loosing the money and going to jail

This is so going to be the embarrassing story at my wedding: when I was kid, I thought the same
I was told, "islands has water all around". We live, and think, in 3D. All around means below too
The very embarrassing part is that I liked geology and geophysics from when I was quite young (from at least age 12 that's what I wanted to study), so I thought that islands were floating, but also knew about plate tectonics at the same time
I knew, though, that islands like Britain or the islands of Denmarks aren't islands, since it just continent that happens to be not flooded, as opposed to the Baltic and North sea .. But I thought that actual islands, like Hawaii and Fiji, had water underneath them
It didn't go away in my mind until I learned about volcanic hot spots and the formation of Hawaii, and not even fully then
Years later, and this is the really embarrassing part, I even said something to the likes of "so when the plate moves away from the hot spot, then the new underwater "rock" will disappear and it will become an island" - and I did this in a bachelors class in geophysics
Luckily not in forum, but to my friends during break
My mind just can't let that "islands have water all around" go away
I have a similar problem with "current is the flow of electrons" and I still have to mentally pause and correct myself
You are free to leave though
Excuse me for messing with the self-fulfilling circlejerk prophecy, but not necessarily
In Denmark, back in the day, it was the poor country districts which managed to get their sh*t together and form a movement of schools and education for everyone, regardless of class
No reason for a farmer to be a know-nothing, nor his wife
To this day, it is called the "Highschool Movement" (or ["Folk High School"] but that's a potentially poor translation imho) - "a citizen-school for life" - founded by [N. F. S. Grundtvig]
Btw, he was a preacher, so religion isn't an excuse
> perhaps 'dumb' (poor) people might just have different interests, values, and opinions
Which they (in the case of wanting an autoritarian rule) have because they are uneducated
I would liken it to isulating you house with asbestos: If you are uneducated about asbestos it seems like a pretty good idea, it's fireproof, cheap and a good insulator
On the other hand if you are educated on what asbestos leads to down the line, lung cancer, mesothelioma and asbestosis you won't use it
Yes in theory it could be that these uneducated people just like lung cancer but I would be much more likely to assume that they just didn't know
And while I would say that it's not intrinsically wrong to isulate with asbestos, we as humans can look at the damage it causes and judge it as wrong or not a good thing
Everyone in that train is about to be down with the sickness
Why the heck did they do that
In Denmark the government asked the public transportation companies to get as many trains and buses rolling as possible, so people wouldn't be crowded together
Buses also don't pick up passengers if they're already half full
That was the strategy for the first few days indeed, but ever since, trains have been running less often than they did before the crisis, with the explanation given being illness levels among staff;
Then it makes sense
True, but they're still trying to compensate by running longer trains with more capacity
[A video about the strategic aspects of the war]
Is there a list of the companies involved, or just something remotely close to that
I would love to find out who's behind
Sometimes it feels like it would just be easier if you just let us Nordics rule your goddamned countries
I mean jeebus christ, get your shit together and clean your room
I only knew that some of the big waste-to-energy combustion units in Denmark and Sweden need more waste
but maybe it's only some kind of waste they need
That would fuck with the danish heating system, we import trash and burn it for energy

Pretty sure we have *some* blame in this mess as well

We will never forget
The world doesn't blink in large part because words have been destroyed
Everybody is a racist, everything is a genocide
Thus nobody is a racist, nothing is a genocide - or ethnic cleansing
And when people read a report of an ethnic cleaning they go, "meh
Third time this week
This article is about alleged ethnic cleansing of Kurds in Turkey, Northern Syria, and Western Iraq
It didn't bother to make the case that it is in fact an ethnic cleansing (a few bombs don't make the cut)
So I'll have to say nonsense
I'm tired of so-called news media coming with bombastic ideological proclamations
Put out the numbers, make the case, or shut the fuck up
News media has become such a load of untrustworthy bullshit
I don't care much about Turkey either way, and Erdogan can go fuck himself, but I have to wonder how much of this recent drummed up anti-Turkey outrage is part of an orchestrated campaign
So I'm going to take the contrary position on this
At least I'm going to have to think thrice before letting myself become enrolled in somebody's political agenda
I’m not the biggest fan of the conservative Turkish leader but you guys cannot summarize this as ethnic cleansing the fighting with terrorist organizations in the middle east
I cannot forget what they did in France,U.K and Germany in 2016-2017 period
So, they are doing well what they do
True, although there can be no question that Turkey doesn't treat the Kurds fair to put it mildly, calling it ethnic cleansing might be taking it too far

Azerbaijan just asked logically for the radar and flight recorder of the crashed plane but Armenia didn’t want to show it
That’s just a propaganda to catch Europeans attention
2020 at it again :(
Armenian Genocide 2: Azerbaijani Boogaloo
Armenia is a certified invader by U.N in this topic and this news is NOT proven
You guys are just crazy
This news is not proved
Most probably Armenian propaganda to hook Europeans interest
So what do you want Azerbaijan to do then ?  Just sitting and accepting all groundless accusations ? Also I’m not saying to Armenia to share their martial codes, I’m just saying if they are pretty sure about their statement, then they have to put forth their sources
I don’t think you understand how NATO work then
The airspace of most eastern European NATO members are protected by western European NATO members
While the transatlantic relation is strained missions are still pretty much carried out as usual
Most eastern European countries are part of NATO and I don’t think that NATO is de facto the USA
A lot of coorperation is happening betwen many member states under the NATO umbrella without american involvement
The Eurofighter for examples, is not developed through the EU, but through the NATO Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency
Also # of jets is not a key figure, # of operational ones are
Russia is however not a superpower, but a regional one
Doesn't really matter when Turkey is willing to risk a conflict with basically anyone

Funny how scandnavia and netherlands have monarchies and we are all happy with while being the most developed countries in the world
Stay mad republics
Literal king
fucking french bastard
I think part of it is the difference betwen knowing what a monarchy is and thinking that you know what it is
I guess a lot of people believe that monarchies works like in Disney or Game of Thrones
Like people saying that monarchs are only monarch, because their ancestors killed enough people, while in reality the three scandinavian royal families was elected into their position
We can still have an opinion about monarchies in other countries
Most Saudis like their monarch, but we can still critique him
And no, im not comparing an actual monarch with power to yours, just saying thats a weird argument
I mean most monarchs does matter
State visits are still a thing
Monarchs are pretty good at insuring a peaceful transfer of power and that you can have non-political appointed judges and civile servants
> Also, people should choose democratically their head of state
Why
I mean there is a lot of people working in the state that are not elected by people
I actuelly think that the head of state being elected is one of the weak points of republics
If the head of state and his party can establish a voting majority in the legal assembly, then you can essentialy coup the republic
That seems to be main way to turn democratic republics into dictatorships
> And the last bit you just pulled it out of your ass

A lot of tanks vs

I was stranded at Gatwick for something like 18 hours a handful of years ago because a cm or two of snow had fallen
I was prepared to grab a shovel and some salt and go clear the fucking thing myself after the first five hours in that hellish airport
37% humidity currently, that's super dry
The wind is not so strong in the [inland climates] Because of the [wind chill factor] the -5 C in Denmark seems more like -20 C with middle wind around 8 m/s.
Judging by the Olympics, it isn't being terraformed to fit he Russians, Norway
Tell me about it
It's minus -4 in Esbjerg, but according to my app, due to wind and humidity it feels like -14
Feelscoldman
The UK was one of the warmest countries in Europe today, it was even colder in parts of Spain and Italy
I bet the wind adds -5 degrees at least tho, my ears nearly froze off today :O
Oh man, the food was actually one of the more significant issues
There just wasn't anything left, because flights were being cancelled or delayed left and right
And of course, you couldn't expect anything from the airlines, when they were called Ryanair, Norwegian, EasyJet, etc
People were almost fighting over some cold, boring sandwiches that were left in one of those WHSmith stores (I think)
Its fucking horrible right now, literally feels like death
80% humidity -8C and 30-50 km/h winds this morning
For sure
Taking the bike anywhere is a nightmare and I'm sure my fingers will fall off on my way home
my gears froze solid over night on my bike
That combined with wind is not fun
How do I unsubscribe from winter
Ryanair were honestly too experienced
They cancelled the flight the night before, so we had to pick up some tickets with Norwegian, as they had not cancelled their flights
Instead, they just got delayed by some 15-16 hours and had to deal with loads of pissed customers, while Ryanair could kind of just sit back
I hate those fuckers for being so damn cheap, that I cannot *not* fly with them ...
Tell me about it ;_; Roughly 10 minutes into my ride to/from work with my shitty thin gloves, and its all icy cold pain
But now I got hot choco so I can forget about it until tomorrow :3
Fuck that noise
I'm staying inside for as long as I can today
I'm a student, so I don't have that many choices if I want to go somewhere
I generally try to fly EasyJet or Norwegian instead of Ryanair though
I actually flew BA in October 2016 to LAX and back again and thought it was quite nice, but then again at this point I'm used to no legroom, no service, no nothing
But yeah
No doubt that I'll be looking to avoid Ryanair at all costs once I'm done with my studies and hopefully become a bit more stable financially
To be perfectly honest, BA was only on the returning flight as the LHR-LAX one was operated by American Airlines
Brand new 777, where I was lucky enough to have the four middle seats all for myself
Never has anyone slept as comfortably in coach before
But on the way back, with BA, it was one of their A380's. It was quite nice, but really not as good as those new 777's.

Question: Is Austria as bad as most other modern nations with it's domination of 2-3 parties of the system
Or is this an extreme feat for the Green Party
Well it will strengthen the EU, with more cooperation between our countries and less individual nationalism/isolation (closed borders)
With UK leaving EU it's a very tense situation in Europe
Every country has gained a lot of right wing followers during the last couple of years and they are basicially all calling for less EU, which would mean (if they got it their way) that every country is more on their own
If countries like France, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, Poland were to follow UK and leave, it would ruin much of the unity that has characterized Europe post ww2
Luckily (in my opinion), Germany (the most powerfull European country) is looking pretty solid

At the 2015 Roskilde Festival I shared a beer and a joint with a Norwegian guy called Christian who told me he was Norwegian royalty, but that he probably never would have to do any official princing around just cause he was like 18th in the line of succesion or something similar
Honestly, I never would have belived it if he didn't look so surprisingly wellgroomed and clean for a Guy attending Roskilde, and if he hadn't had a little posse of sober looking people with him that seemed to be checking the surroundings alot
I mean he might very easily just have said the whole thing to get some laughs and a bit of my Jay and his friends might have seemed slightly on Edge because of the surroundings infront of the orange stage but whenever I meet any Norwegian thats an atleast half decent person I try to get them merry and partying just because they are so much fun to let loose with, I mean, he didn't have to do the Elaborate ruse but you know, I know what my story Will be next time I visit Norge

For Norway it is also about exporting electricity which earns the energy sector a lot of money
Plus energy consumption will likely increase in Norway as a result of growth in your heavy industries (oil, aluminium etc) and household consumption (electric cars etc)
Denmark reach the target before the negotiations even started
Sure
I wasn't clear
I was just trying to explain why it makes sense to expand renewable energy generation even though you are at a 100 (for electricity) already
It is a good thing
And even if there is no will to develop more hydro it makes sense to develop wind in Northern Norway as there is a lot of complimentarity between the weather up there and in the North Sea area where most European wind generation will be situated in the future
This surely isn't the case in Denmark
We have the highest share of wind in the grid and one of the highest rates of reliability in Europe
We don't even need central power plants for stability any more
I know
My point is that it is possible to have reliable electricity distribution  without big central power plants
Even though Denmark still depend on those (coal, biomass and gas) there are periods where the Danish grid rely solely on import and decentral generation (e.g. wind and solar)

Sadly not a lot of love for art deco around here
Damn, I love that style - but all in all, I believe a mixture of buildings constructed in varying styles are best for a city
As long as it's not a steel-and-glass cube with no other details, I'm all for it
Not in my experience
Modernism has mostly been displaced by postmodernism for a few decades now, and from my own personal experience, those I've talked to all prefer the postmodernist look over the modernist
If you look at something like Taipei 101 or Burj Khalifa, those are postmodernist structures
Yes, they're steel and glass, but they're not just boxes - they have interesting shapes and forms
Whereas the old NY WTC buildings 1 and 2 were pure boxy international style modernism
Hmm, I think that's a bit of a simplification
Deco drew inspiration from many different styles, including mesoamerican and other traditional tribal styles
It had all the detail that earlier styles did, but with a very distinctive style, whereas modernism was more of a reaction against the very idea of detailed construction ("a house is a machine for living in")
As such, I think Deco was just the latest in a line of opulent styles of construction, which was what modernism rebelled against
Many features of deco, such as streamlined design of buildings, haven't been seen before or since, except in post-modernist buildings that specifically draw inspiration from art deco

We simply rock ;)
Danmark med stolte 632 point - HVOR ER SVENSKEN
Det er slet ikke svært
Why on earth would a Dane speak English with a Norwegian
It's such a cutesy singsong language
Honestly, we don't really have anything important to speak about anyway
It’s that weird going up one octav norwegians do at the end of a sentence, makes it hard to focus on wtf they’re saying
No issue understanding swedish tbh
Same
I found some old english essays i wrote in 9th grade, fucking butchered the grammar
5-6 years of wow later, i had a teacher tell me my english was really, really good
Exposure matters a ton
I love how taunting the Swedes is the great Nordic pastime that unites us all
Suck it Sweden
"Fjeldabe" (mountain-monkey) is a purely danish word, i assume you approve ;)
- Don't take things to serious, have a nice weekend
Når man først får det lært
Yeah, there was something about the British colonizing the world at some point
True brother, true
Skål!
Yeah it’s difficult to type ofc, but you kinda hit a high tone at the end of a sentence
Written Norwegian is basically the same as written Danish
You'd only need to learn a few key differences and you should be able to approach it as if it was Norwegian
*Spoken* Danish is an entirely different beast however
Often when I read something in Norwegian it takes me a few sentences before I realise that it's not Danish
Hey
- Those things are on TV
Much
(But actually, the word "Fjeldabe" refers to our northern cousins, they have mountains
I think)
Got me there, we actually never had another word for weekend
I might try to claim the brits took our word
- would work
- Yes
- Vikændt
You got me there
Bottom looks like a minecraft map
Good
I really hope more countries begin rejecting these archaic, sexist religious practices
If you don’t want to adopt German culture, you don’t get to be a German citizen
The entitlement I’m seeing all over Europe, as though migrants *deserve* citizenship; they *deserve* free healthcare and amazing social services and free housing and education and free money, **without lifting a fucking finger to adopt and better the society they’ve chosen
** Fuck them
Hopefully one day we immediately deport people like this
No, I’m not being hyperbolic
I want these assholes to make *damn* sure they’re willing to leave their evil values behind when they migrate
If they don’t want to do that they shouldn’t come
Same in Denmark, here you have to shake hands with the mayor of your town and a bunch of other people at a ceremony where you receive the citizenship
If you refuse to shake hands with either of these people, you cannot get a citizenship and as it is a bunch of people, it's rare there is no women in the group
idk if its like that in germany, but in denmark you have to shake hands in order to pass the citizenships test
they did this because they knew muslim women didnt want to shake hands with men, so they force them to
Good
I do know the general hatred towards the Turks because of the political stuff on here but the thing is at least they are more civilized and europeanized than these radical people who migrated from the Third World countries
And what if you're a Roman trying to avoid the plague
And I am an immigrant in Denmark
It’s abundantly clear from statistics that migrants from some countries do really well, and from other countries, really badly
It’s time we start taking a practical and realistic approach here
It seems clear that Germany *doesn’t* value his sexism
Why would he believe that Germany would value his sexism
The beef between the Dutch and the sea just ascended to a new level
No way
How would all the rivers be drained
This is a solid idea
Sincerely, Denmark (average elevation 34 m)
Can we make the Brits pay for it
We can always depend on the Dutch to come up with these dam solutions
I don't see any reason why that couldn't work if people were willing to pay for it all
However, the potential problem with dikes, dams etc
is obviously them failing at some point
Imagine if the water outside that dam is just a meter higher than on the inside, and the dam then breaking somewhere
Imagine the amount of water that'd suddenly come rushing in towards the low lying areas we wanted to protect in the first place
It may be the best idea we're ever going to see though so we'd better hope they're well made and will last for a long time
I can't be the only one getting an archeology boner from the though of the neolithic stuff we could find down there
> However, effectively closing off the entire North and East Sea can't be good for the ecosystem
When we build this dam the ecosystem will be destroyed anyhoo
> Atlantropa
Kinda a akin to this idea
I still believe in making a massive saltwater lake in Egypt
Mexico
The water would recede gradually so in theory you could make blanket geophys screenings of the entire area as it drains
It would need to be highly automated, like autonomous vehicles and analysis done by AI, but it' within the realm of possibility
Of course geophys won't catch everything, quite on the contrary in the case of the neolithic, but it would be a chance to do something before it's all turned into wheat fields
"Tis just a small one"
Også mig, tak
In most Nordic languages, this is actually pretty much what it says
In my native Danish, "everything" would be "alting".
I d'oh'ed
In Danish too, though spelt a bit wrong

Indeed lol
This map desperately needs a legend
If russia wins, technicly asia is the biggest winner of the World cup ;)
Yeah, we could still end up losing to Europe
EC is harder to win than the world cup probably, but the world cup has this other cultural dimension to it that makes it super interesting for everyone, not just people interested in football
Did you guys see how awesome the iranian fans were
That really left an impression with me
And the Senegalese fans dancing with their team during the warm up
The japanese cleaning up their lockerroom after they lost their match and had to go home
Its like a celebration of the good kind of differences that there are
And the joy in the game that is universal
Something, something, World Series, only American teams, something
Also, here are some of the countries in the world cup finals not from South America or Europe
Mexico, Australia, South Korea, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Senegal and Egypt
Ahh right sorry my bad
But still, it shouldn't come as a surprise that the top 4 nations in the world are from one of those 2 continents, considering how big a part of our culture football really is
It's the same thing with basketball
Since the Berlin Olympics in 1936, the USA have been in the top 3 every single time, except for the Moscow Olympics in 1980 (and they probably would have been in the top 3 if they had participated)
Also, they won gold medals 15 out of 19 times, honestly it's more exciting to see who will win silver and bronze
Well, they can just pay star players to accept Qatari citizenship and then proceed to assemble an all star national team from these players

So very, incredibly sad :(
Who's cutting onions in here
How is Schengen any different from the EU's freedom of movement
The question is if Italy will leave schengen after this
The Nordic Council members have also had that since 1952
Brexit has just become this stupid piece of symbolic politicism, and people will do their best to get it to happen despite knowing it's a bad idea
I think I read Ireland's population never recovered
Ah yes, it's not a christian holiday, it's a Pågen holiday
No Danes here

Also not forgetting Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta etc
Understandable since your main industries are nothing but tax-evasion and corruption
I couldn't disagree more
It's far better than Chrome is, IMO
Has more useful features, better design, more customizability, better plugin API, smaller footprint, and I personally far prefer the dev tools
That's something polish people doesn't like to hear
You sound like an American
Being against universal healthcare and education because you want to skim that extra amount of money
I'd also wager and say that NL has a much better and more equal society than Ecuador

" All right, but apart from the sanitation, the medicine, education, wine, public order, irrigation, roads, a fresh water system, and public health, what have the Romans ever done for us
" - John Cleese
Well all of that is true, which doesn't change the fact that things are slowly getting out of hand
You see benefits, I see hours and hours of unproductive work in administrative costs
Just more virtue signalling implemented as busy work to manage and oversee that all these rules are being enforced which does not increase the wealth of a nation but rather subtracts from it
Except for perhaps the trade negotiations which certainly improves all of our chances to get free trade agreements on an international level
Oddest comment so far
The EU does the exact opposite and you're not allowed to make special tax deals
Which is why Ireland is currently in court over Apples 14 billion euro tax bill
This is going to set the proceedings for other cases
The only thing you can complain about is the EU not being able to enforce it more effectively
However if they were people would be crying about how the EU has too much power over the member states and that the EU has become a federal superstate
That's actually insane
It’s like a Phoenix
Denmark: [We're down with bridges too - and artifacts
Something always bothered me about that design
While the notes themselves get longer and longer, why does it not start with the shortest bridge for the 50kr note and then use longer and longer bridges as you go up in value
Now we have the shortest of the bridges on the 200kr note, and that's just silly
Our largest bill, the 1000 kr
is 134,36 €. Now that our banks have negative interest on savings, I think a lot of people are seriously considering taking money out of the banks and storing them in cash
Large bills like the 500€ would be good for that purpose
And yes, it probably would be smarter to invest, but that is risky, and with the corona virus still around, the future of the economic situation has become harder to predict

Hey that looks awesome
May I ask what camera / phone / whenever you used to take it
This is such an outrageous claim that it is frankly absurd
> it’s probably the only way to transition away from fossil fuels fast enough
This is straight untrue
Wind is both cleaner and cheaper as well as much less environmentally invasive than nuclear
The dialogue on nuclear is always on nuclear vs fossil fuels, which is a completely pointless debate
The actual debate should be on what the best alternatives to fossil fuels are, a catagory where there's significantly more options than just nuclear as Reddit would like us to believe
There's so many issues facing nuclear power that makes it just about the worst solution we could choose to transition away from fossil fuels
Nuclear power is costly
*Significantly* more so than the alternatives
People in the UK are currently looking at having to pay 2
5 times as much for power generated from Hinkley Point (once it finishes) as they are right now
The only clean part of nuclear is the process itself
Construction and decomissioning of the plant, disposal of nuclear waste along with extraction of Uranium are all incredibly damaging to the environment as well as emitting significant amounts of carbon (not comparable to how much fossil fuels emit, but still a very notable amount)
And finally, and this is frankly the biggest issue facing clean energy production, it has a pronounced lack of flexibility
Flexibility in energy production is incredibly important as was clearly shown in Texas just a month ago
Nuclear isn't realistically able to meet the flexible demand for energy (and neither is wind or solar for that matter), yet it is of vital importance that we find a way to generate clean and flexible energy as currently the best solution is looking to be natural gas (which obviously isn't sustainable in the long term)
And just to preempt the "but nuclear power is flexible" crowd
Yes, it is physically possible but the economic side of things make it an impossiblity, not to mention that the carbon emission resulting from flexible nuclear power would be comparable to that of fossil fuels, which kind of defeats the point
I spent some time researching this topic as it is a rather interesting debate, despite how lopsided it is on Reddit
Trying to take a step back and take an objective stance on the topic it became abundantly clear that Nuclear Power is just about the worst solution to the energy crisis short of sticking with fossil fuels
I can provide peer-reviewed research on every claim I made above if it is of interest to anyone
No it does not
Nuclear power totals 66
08g CO2/kWh (analysis made by Sovacool and Valentine in *The National Politics of Nuclear Power: Economics, Security and Governance)
* They have a complete breakdown of the sources of emission as well if you're interested
This is compared to the 11 g/kWh for onshore wind, 12g/kWh for offshore wind and 27 g/kWh for solar
It's still a far cry from the 490 g/kWh of natural gas (the "cleanest" of the fossil fuels)
This is including operation, maintenance, construction, decomissioning and fabrication
Regardless, I honestly think it is the least relevant point to discuss
If we could achieve anything near 66g/kWh emission for the entire energy sector we would've come a *very long* way to solving the crisis
It doesn't even have to last that long
Just long enough for us to transition fully to other energy sources
I think that's being very optimistic about when we will be 100% renewable
Its not only about us (Europe) either but also about more poor areas who will definitely not be 100% renewable in 10 years
Also the last place to be hellenic in ck2 769 start date
Also, a reaaaally large portion of the "christians" here are probably christians by tradition only
Don't go to church, don't pray, but attend funerals and celebrate christmas
If you want to measure christianity then self-identification gets really sloppy
I know i’m about to be downvoted into oblivion by Le Atheists but i think this is sad
I identify as cultural christian/agnostic christian and don’t really believe in god but I like going to church on holidays and I adore cathedrals
To think that in the future even on Easter Sunday my church probably won’t fill up or that maintenance of old churches won’t be prioritised makes sad
And good riddance
Thank god
Good man
From looking at this thread it is obvious
The Union can stand no longer we shall split into two entities, the ones who like pineapple and the **Scum
I will never understand ananas (hah
) on pizza
I like ananas but it completely overwhelms the taste of everything else on the pizza
It's not like it's a "mild" tasting fruit after all
I see it like most other fruits tbh
I like oranges, bananas, and strawberries as well but I don't want them on my fucking pizza
Make some sort of dessert with ananas, oranges, bananas or whatever and I'm fine with it but don't kill my pizza
I actually like the taste of pizza so completely overwhelming it with the ananas taste is just awful
It's like the people who want coffee that tastes of cola, berries, beer etc
or beer that tastes of coffee or liquorice or mint etc
It's not that the taste of coffee, beer, berries, liquorice and cola is bad but that doesn't mean it all goes together
I also like salmon, nutella and red wine but don't fucking mix them
ALL POWER TO THIS MAN

That's a strange way to spell UNQUESTIONABLY AND UNDENIABLY IMPROVE BY SEVERAL ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE but whatever, it's cool, I understood what you meant
You can always stay, homie of the North
You have to switch to using "ananas" though
She is getting fried
Yeah but they have other desserts other than biscuits like ice cream sundaes and jelly and pretty good milkshakes, so we aren't missing out
What are they then

Woah, things are happening . They are happening fast right now
Yea like Russia and Pluto
Now all their troubles have not been in vain
Honestly what the fuck happened to England and tuition fees
Just some ten years ago before I started my uni degree I looked into going to the UK and then I believe it was £3000 per year
£9000 per year is absolutely fucking insane, honestly and afaik it is not even just oxbridge but all unis because setting it lower than the maximum by law would indicate you being a "lesser" school
Can anyone tell me how Scotland is not breaking EU freedom of movement of English students by doing this
There would be a lot of interested Danish politicians in how to stop EU students from studying in Denmark
Amazing how badly managed the UK is
And still people elect Tory governments
It's weird
I'm pretty sure this is inaccurate
Atleast in my case I've been informed (by student advisers at Scottish universities) that I as a EU citizen have to pay same tuition fees like UK students
Options are either specific loans or looking into programmes like the Eramus programme
So I have no idea what this post is about
Maybe I've missed some vital information somewhere
> Currently, EU students are charged the same level of tuition fee as UK students
The University is still finalising fee levels for 2019
We expect to announce them shortly
It is encouraging though that the Scottish government has already committed to providing the same level of funding support for EU students applying for postgraduate study in 2019-20
EU students can apply for a tuition fee loan up to £5,500
It's pretty obvious that Scotland can't offer free education to the rest of the UK with the ways the prices in the rest of their country are going
Everyone from England, Wales and Northern Ireland would go to Scotland for a free education which Scotland obviously can't afford
When Scotland offers students from Denmark (or whatever similar country out there
) a free education it's not nearly as big of a problem as Denmark already has free education that doesn't require people to move "far" (relatively speaking) away to get it
The vast majority of Danish students study in Denmark even though they can get free education elsewhere as well
If an English student had to option to save ~9k a year by going to school a bit further north, Scotland would be overrun by students taking advantage of their system, and they'd need massive financial help from the rest of the UK to fund that
In that case they might as well just get rid of the insane costs in England instead and spend that funding there
So where is all this money going
The universites are public, are they not
I assume the administration is being paid generously
When I visisted Cambridge I was told that the university owns basically most of downtown
I think this system is more classist than a tax-funded system
Poor people who grew up in a home that barely made ends meet are less likely to take on crazy amount of debt just to go to school
Aren't all the student loans in the US federally backed
How so
Genuinly curious
>But it's not debt that you have to pay if you don't make money
No, I completely understand
My point is if you are from a low income family and your family has no educational background and have always been carpenters or whatever
Then taking on £9000 per year is extremely daunting and your family will think you are fucking crazy for wanting it
This will discourage some
In Denmark where I am from, university is free and you get financial support from the govt
and we have some of the highest upward social mobility in the world
>The system increases access to poor people
I completely disagree
Ahh, yes
Yeah - big conumdrum
And sad for the UK
Sorry but that is not how it works
In Denmark, the lower social echelon of society takes a lot of resources and the top echelon pays a lot of taxes
So for a short while the university student has his/her education paid for by everyone - including the uneducated - but afterwards they contribute in taxes for the healthcare, childcare, eldercare, unemployment for the uneducated
The goverment already subsidizes startups here
EDIT: and the entire agriculture business
Delays infection speed, which can spread people who needs to be hospitalized over a longer period causing less strain on the healthcare system
Wow, take it easy buddy
I'm merely repeating what the government officials told us
I was not stating my own opinion
It doesn't matter who I listen to
My voice has no political power anyway
I didn't vote for the current government and they will sit there for at least 3 more years until we find out if people liked their handling of the crisis or not at the voting booth
But to me it does make a certain degree of sense that having less people means less people to get infected and less people needing hospital beds
Now I'm really curious
What exactly encompasses "all the good Napoleon did"? Because I have only ever heard him portrayed in a negative light
Fair enough
I must admit I never really studied him closely
I just know him as the emperor of France who committed atrocities and waged a whole lot of wars
And apparently that's enough to get you downvoted on here
True, in the end it was a bourgeois revolution that only replaced the old masters with new
This is the good kind of renovation, much better then modern renovation that destroy buildings
I worry about europe in general but specifically France
I don't even want to imagine what its like in 50-100 years if nothing is done about this
The problem is that muslims have a lot of kids compared to non-muslims

Leave it to teh people that made Jesus their king to make a universiy that looks like a church
You don't "choose to move on from the controversy" that's not how controversy works, it doesn't stop when you decide you no longer want it
Yeah, real nice of the US to export their lying, racist and bigotted politicians as ambassadors
Leaves a good impression
> Hoekstra, who was born in the Netherlands but raised in Michigan as a staunch social conservative
Being a social conservative means being ok with lying, apparently

Because it seems you have a mix of "shit", "satan" & "crap".
Not the same word though
Lort
Come on, that's just a slightly spicier word for poo, doesn't even count as shit
We say fanden, or Satan
Danish has the “fandens” too
Luxembourg cuss word #1: Tax
Kind of impossible to find a native translation since we just use "fuck" as a loan word all the time
Dane: Swede
Swede: We were talking curse words
Dane: Exactly
Pis, for fanden, satans, for helvede, fandens også, og sikkert flere jeg ikke lige kan komme i tanke om
Men jeg har aldrig hørt nogen bruge lort
Porca
I hardly know 'er
Jeg synes for fanden / fandens også er ved at blive gammeldags
Pis og fuck er vel de mest brugte
Det er også virkelig mundret
Jeg bruger "lort" ofte omkring ting
"Det er noget lort", "saml det der lort op". Selv hvis det er ting jeg er glad for
Stadig en bunke lort
Men hvis det bliver brugt i samme ånd som putain, scheisse eller fuck, så tror jeg helt klart "pis" og "fuck" er meget mere populære blandt danskere
Det vil jeg i hvert fald give dig ret i. Det er nok de to jeg bruger mest i hvert fald

There's a lot of curviness in art deco too, although it's usually streamlined/smooth curves, which fits well with the cowl of the Reaper here, and also the neck on the man is a smooth line
Furthermore, Art Deco tends towards an idealized view of the human, which is the reason for the muscular build which is repeated in many art deco sculptures (such as the Yuri Gagarin statue in Moscow)
Art Deco was popular both in the east and the west, and 'socialist realism' took a lot of inspiration from Art Deco - both were optimistic art styles at heart

How come Denmark didnt wanna talk about jews
we have jews here, right
I think this is an odd survey: It asks about two different religions, the inhabitants of an entire continent and a colour which is not even a proper skincolour
What about all the Turkish, Iranian, Afghan and Kurdish immigrants in Europe
Most of them are muslim as well as asians
Would you feel comfortable if your child was in a relationship with a Swede
It's a surprise to most Danes that discrimination against Jews is still a thing in many western countries
Whereas Sweden, the UK, and France are like: "Please just marry my child
Yes, but middle Eastern muslims would be Asians, so they would be in another part of the survey
Iranians, Chinese, Lebanese, Indians, Thai, Vietnamese, Saudi Arabians and Afghanis are all Asians
A third of russians are also Asian
In what universe is Asian a race
Or Roma for that matter
Doo it
Doo it nau
I am sure you have
Loads of Danes has a Jewish background
They just don't have funny names like Morgenstern, Goldmesser or Krankenzimmer

The middle East is literally a region in Asia
Being middle Eastern implies being Asian
Asian is a word describing people from the continent of Asia, including Iranians, Afghanis, Indians, Chinese, Vietnamese and 25% of russians
Gypsy is more a lifestyle than an ethnic classification
That's exactly it
Religion just isn't seen as a topic of interest here so it just doesn't come up very often
I have no clue if I've met any Catholic or Baptist Danes either for the same reason
I might have but how would I ever know
> And yet, in many countries people who see the word Asian will think of the Far East rather than the near East
A lot of people in a lot of countries are uninformed then
Gypsies are many different kinds of people
In brittain many, if not most, gypsies are irish
Asians are people from asia
Asia is a landmass with defined boundaries
If people think otherwise then they are mistaken

We decided a while ago to stop caring about trees in Denmark i guess
"Oops"

Ok, hands down, I thought Denmark had a lot of trees
This is most likely because the country is quite densely populated and a decently large portion of the forests have probably been cleared to make farmland

As I understand it, any place/person using bits of online journalistic content must pay a fee
You would have to pay to be allowed to post it on Facebook, Facebook would have to pay for having the link there on your profile, etc
From [this] I think you are correct
Facebook would have to get a license from a news agency to be allowed to have links to that agency's site
And, as the consequences section of that site points out, if Facebook doesn't want to buy those licenses, we'll all end up seeing a lot less reputable news sources
Where NSDAP at tho
They didn't haha, Danish people in general just do not care anymore
There is barely anyone left who is pro-immigrant
Refreshing to see these statistics aren't using Norway's 2011 numbers anymore
Because of the Utøya-attack, Norway had a 2

The year before and after had roughly one fourth that
These maps and charts have without fail used the 2011 numbers for many years
I'm surprised Iceland isn't lower
I agree with turkey not being European,  but there's alot of debate if it should be included or not,
TECHNICALLY it's both Asian and European, but technically is so many other countries and you have to draw the line somewhere, afaik this sub considers turkey a part of Europe, but I might be remembering wrong
Switzerland has much stricter gun laws than the US in regards to how you can purchase the guns and how to store them
But yes, there are other factors at play as well
But that doesn't mean guns are not an important factor
[Harvard has a research centre dedicated to the effects firearms has on society
I agree that it's geographically more in the middle East
> People understimate how deadly knives are
You just need to get a bit closer but once you are within reach
It still takes a lot more to kill with a knife than with a gun
You need to stab someone in a critical area, which can only really be done deliberately
Meanwhile, with guns it's just pulling a trigger and you roll the dice
> There are 3-4 people injured by guns for every killed one on average
No, this is incorrect
The figure is barely over 2 injuried for everyone killed, at least [in the US:]
> In 2013, there were 73,505 nonfatal firearm injuries (23
2 injuries per 100,000 people),[7][8] and 33,636 deaths due to "injury by firearms" (10
6 deaths per 100,000 people)
This was the first hit that popped up
How does this compare with knives
I found some [data on this from London:]
> A total of 938 knife injuries were identified from 127,191 attendances (0
77% of all visits) with a case fatality rate of 0
53%.
That's 200 injuries to every death
That makes guns almost 100 times more deadly than knives
So yes, firearms are deadlier than knives
Far deadlier
That doesn't mean you cannot kill with a knife, but it just takes more effort and you're likely to stop stabbing before you've killed your victim
That's not the case with guns
> You just need to stab randomly
Yeah, and if you do, you need to stab repeatedly
Which again, requires more effort than pulling a trigger
My point is that accidentally killing someone you shoot would be more common than accidentally killing someone you stab
Say two people become aggressive towards each other
In one scenario, they both pull a knife, while in the other, they both pull a gun
Where do you think there is the highest risk of death
> Just consider the size of ah average knife and of the average bullet
You do realize that gun shots cause the tissue to expand, right
> Im pretty sure a lot of gun shot wounds gets unreported
And this wouldn't be the case for knives, because
> On the other hand, there is a lot of ways you can get injured by a knife that doesnt involve violence
Accidental shootings happen as well
But yes, I'll grant you that accidental injury is more common with knives
> Also, most of those US gun deaths are suicides, the sad fact is that a suicide very likely to succeed if you use a gun
It's about 2:1 suicides to homicides
Even removing suicides would still leave us at about 6 injuries for every homicide by gun or accidental death by gun
> Have you actually ever shot a pistol
I've shot air guns at targets, and I've shot a hunting rifle
Yes, it's difficult to hit at range
But it's easier to hit at range than with a knife, obviously
> If you shoot or stab someone by accident, youve done something very, very wrong
No, I'm saying that it's easier to slash someone in the arms and then have one of the knife fighters flee the scene than shooting someone and having the other flee
> If hey both pull knives, chances are they both bleed to death before any help comes, unless one of them is much more skilled
No, I disagree
The body is quite resilient
I'd argue that one of them will be injured and flee unless the other part really wants to kill them
But in a knife fight, that's generally not the objective
The objective is to either defeat the other guy or defend yourself
Both objectives are achieved once the other guy is injured and doesn't want to fight anymore
Why
Because it's far more probable that you'll hit an arm than the neck or some other vital spot because the other guy will use his arm for protection and it will be closer to you
In a gun fight
You don't really have much say in whether you're shooting to kill or shooting to injure
There is far less control over this than with a knife, exactly because hitting precisely with a gun is far more difficult than with a knife
> Pistol rounds are mostly too slow to really cause hydrostatic shock
I'm not talking about hydrostatic shock
I'm talking about the kinds of wounds you see when you search for gun wound in google images
That kind of damage
Which is the reason why it's more difficult to treat and more lethal than stab wounds, as per what the UK surgeon said
> Bleeding is very dangerous and its not that hard to cut a major blood vessel with a long slash
But still less likely that to fatally shooting someone

When Denmark voted for the Euro in 2002, 46,8% voted for and 53,2% against
I have a hard time believing how that number is now 28%.
You will never take the queen away from our currency
We have our own currency, kroner, which we can use at the German border
Yeah, especially since Europositivism is up recently
I'd wager that a campaign from SRFÅ+VK, DA and FH could get us to 45-55%, as these EU elections always seem to turn out
If economic trouble comes (again) and it becomes favorable to pursue a different interest policy than what the ECB have, then you just do it
Leaving the EU would be easier if that ever becomes an issue
As a non euro nation your country is not guarantying for the bond buying to support euro nations that struggle with high debt, unemployment and fiscal deficits
Especially the last one is critical
If Denmark had been a euro member and wanted to leave we would have gained an extra debt equivalent to something like 10 great belt bridges
Just getting the population to support constructing one was difficult, but 10 at the same time
What not say “gold”? It means literally gold isn’t it
I would hate it
There's so many small coins
They're completely useless
But we're moving away from physical currency anyway, so it won't have a major impact anyway
Can't recall the last time I paid with cash
Yeah but it is a voluntary peg that resulted in low interests in Denmark when the eurozone had its last crisis
Imo you should have both common monetary policy and fiscal policy but since it is not possible, you should have neither
The peg ensured Danish politicians did not devaluate the currency, but found a different way to regulate money flows
Our situation is not like Greece
It was more similar back in the early 1980's when we pegged the currency, but now we got a massive pension private pension savings, little to zero foreign currency issued debt, stable/balanced public finances and huge positive trade balances
It's less stable
In some situations that can be an advantage - if the Swedish economy does poorly, the krona can lose value, making Swedish exports more competitive and helping economic recovery
But there are disadvantages too, like typically paying higher interest on debt
We really cannot
We had 20% interest rates before pegging, and getting even close to that would completely kill the Danish economy, as well as ruin the private economies of hundreds of thousands of households because of how flexible interest rate loans work
We're already literally paying banks to loan money from our national bank to push down interest, so there's nothing to really push on on that front, and we're pegging _way_ closer than the ERMII requirements because we **need** the additional lower interest rates we can get by being even more identical to the Euro
The reality is that even a looser peg is a complete no-go at this point
We do have the Euro in practice and the cost of changing that is so unimaginably high that it can realistically never be the best option
We just give up our potential Euro voting rights to feel good about having different bill designs
Not really
The USA have kind of the same problem
States with weak economies suffer from being in a union together with states with strong economies
Its an old friend we have gotten so used to we forget to address the issue of its existence
All Danish government debt is issued in Danish currency, and the trillions of pension kroners invested abroad ensures foreign currency is flowing to the central bank even if there was not a huge trade surplus
Scrapping the peg is no longer such a frightening thing, and considering Norway and Sweden free floats its currency, Denmark could do the same
Probably will not do it, for the simple reason that as long as we have the peg, the politicians can not mess with the currency
Yes
Print currency which will devaluate the currency and cause moderate inflation
This can be a good thing if needed
Maybe not for Denmark, but certainly could have been for Greece
I'm one of the 28% who disagree with that
We should be part of the euro imo
> To make new factories, Greece will need to import German machinery which will be relatively more expensive
The major export industry in Greece is tourism
That doesn't require German machinery
Chinese machinery competes very successfully recently
Printing industry for example, long years on German machines but Chinese are taking over, it will be the same elsewhere
Inflation can be caused by many things, not just printing money (as inflation is just the price-index of goods and services)
Unemployment skyrocketed after the crisis, especially in Greece
Having control of their own currency could have mitigated a large part of this
The inflation percentage is not the single number that is important
That only works for dealing with the natural fluctuations that come with recessions
The Greece Debt Crisis is fundamentally different, in that it is caused by structurally flawed financial management (which was covered up by the government), which means that structural economic management changes are what's needed
The West found this out the hard way back in the 70’s and 80’s, where the 1973 oil crisis caused spending to be unreasonably high, but this was approached as a recession
The issue wasn’t fixed, but the West now had both a debt crisis and an interest crisis (banks were charging 20-25% additional interest because of fears of government devaluation) along with it
This later caused the rise of Neoliberalist economic management, which dictated that a stable currency was priority number 1, as well as many decisions that really hurt, as it turned out that solving the interest rate crisis and spending crisis were the first steps to get back on track
The issue with dealing with structural economic mismanagement at a late stage is that there’s no way to deal with it that doesn’t hurt a lot
Convenience, higher influence on EU monetary policies, and showing support for the EU project
A national export is work your citizens do, which foreign citizens pay for
For example a Greek worker makes a car, a German buys it in Germany, so you made money by exporting it
Tourism is an export by the same reasoning
For example your restaurant make a meal, a German pays for it
You just transferred German money to the Greek economy
The fact that the German person is in Greece the moment he pays of the work of the Greek worker is immaterial for whether the work functions as an export
Infinitely more than 0 people
Not to mention that the decision made are directed by the EC and EUCO where each memberstate has a single representative
Small nations have greater proportional representation everywhere in the EU
I feel like the weather has forgotten that the nordic and baltic countries are a part of europe

Thought that was agar

That's really smart
Definetely like the style of the map, though I find it a bit barren of cities, it makes Europe look like a desert landscape
Though I can see you mostly did the capital thing since borders don't show on the map it makes it look a bit weird is all, what with it not being entirely consistent (Some countries get more than one city, some don't, some don't get a city at all
Nice try, but whoever drew this forgot about [The Mountain of Heaven] in Denmark while making the topography
Love the style, can't help but be reminded of the intro to Game of Thrones
Kjolen means "The dress" in danish
I like that there's no apparent national borders and only some text legend, it gives it a more exploratory feel (If that makes sense
But yay, larger cities
Don't apologize, the map is absolutely great the way it is
So what if some forrest in Poland isn't on it, jeez
And I don't really see how any key cities are missing, isn't every European capital represented
Edit: Maybe I'm just tired, but I couldn't find Prague
Don't beat yourself up about it, map is still wonderful
That's more like it
Also, quite funny that I as a dane is pointing out that Prague was missing
Young danes are quite infamous in the Czech capital for being an obnoxious bunch of drunken assholes
And soon afterwards Latvia and Lithuania as well
Crazy how these small countries tries to overtake a giant nation like Russia

That is so beautiful, we have something similar in Denmark on this day but not quite as impressive
4th of may is our liberation day, too
We set a candle in our window during the evening, to show respect and remember the fallen soldiers who helped gain our freedom and liberation from the germans
Same in Denmark
The tradition of the candles on the evening of the 4th is that the BBC broadcast to Denmark in the evening of 4 may 1945 revealed that Germany had surrendered
People took down the blackout curtains that had been there for 5 years and went into the streets to celebrate
The tradition started soon efter that every year on  the 4th
Ah thank you, it is actually the same here in Denmark too, I just got it mixed up
The 4th is remembering the soliders who fell, the 5th is the actual liberation day
Thanks for correcting that
I believe several European countries have the same dates for these events, since the Germans retreated at around the same time
We were liberated late on the 4th, the radio announced this at 20:36 in the evening
And so the 5th became the actual liberation day, where everyone woke up to a war that had finally ended
Coming from the *other* bicycle-obsessed country, I'm proud of you, Germany

We have 25c for almost 2 weeks now, here in Denmark, this is already the year with most qualified summerdays in years, I have no idea how to handle this and I'm expecting the rest of the year to be rainy any day now
yup i feel you - Denmark
Having to work in an office when it's around 25 degrees is not fun
Ideally it would be around 15-18 in the summer, and if i want it hotter i will travel to it
Then again i'm a vinter person

I hope you were you able to do it faster than the Belgians were with their Palace de Justice in Brussels
When we moved to Brussels in the mid-90's I remember the scaffolding being on the building, I don't remember ever having seen the building without it, and apparently they [won't be done be done before 2028] Apparently budget cuts to the cleaning have been so bad that the old scaffolding literally rusted to the building, forcing them to start over
My favourite example of how bad planning in Brussels can be was from the road in front of one of my classmate's house, within two years they tore up and repaved their road three times; once to lay down new gas lines, another to lay down new electricity lines and a third to put down new water pipes, while each time took months to do the job

Now consider there are idiots in this country who would want a Czech-out
To be fair, just because you're not part of the EU, doesn't mean you can no longer import or export EU goods, or that it would necessarily become more expensive for you to do so
Czechxit could work too
It's like that for all people in any of the memberstates

Just ask them
They have a few days to comply
Which is understandable really
> This is the approach for companies that heard about the GDPR 2 yearsago, said "its plenty of time left" and yesterday went like "what do you mean it is tomorrow
Not even that
There is way too much business in it that youd go " what do you mean its tomorrow - fuck its lets stop giving them access instead of complying" just because its suddenly the time runs short
They just stored and sold shitton of data and made it their actual main business
Otherwise there is no way theyd get so much damage from GDPR that theyd feel the need to do that
Kinda
I'm guessing that if they don't reside in the EU, and don't really do business in the EU, then you'd have a hard time dragging them into an EU court
Maybe
Just like I'm pretty sure that I won't end up in a Chinese court due to my (theoretically) internationally available website
Recital 23 of the GDPR "...In order to determine whether such a controller or processor is offering goods or services to data subjects who are in the Union, it should be ascertained whether it is apparent that the controller or processor envisages offering services to data subjects in one or more Member States in the Union
This is pretty much how jurisdiction has worked as it concerns consumer law within the EU
But now being extended to data protection
It basically means that if the company attempts or has the appearance of selling to EU citizens, then they need to be compliant with the GDPR
So maybe they would not have to comply with EU law, in the case where they are not targeted towards EU citizens
Some things like having a significant amount of EU customers would suffice as proof of being under GDPR

It all depends on how the rest of the country behaves, whether it has an influence on future relationships
And you know like fucking Linux
European cars are becoming increasingly automatic as well, party because of rising demand for automatics in Europe and decreasing costs
And that's a good thing, because here in Europe we produce great automatics, just look at the DSG
He has
He complained at Toyota for considering a factory in Mexico rather than the U.S.
Yay
Okay I mean I get most of them (especially food standards), but Danes are pretty dumb if they think that the EU would not be better for military defense
The danes are just vibing
Im glad to see my contry doing good :)
my whole family if from there, they used to live on the edge of the islands at a place called HELL no joke
stayed there every summer for a couple of years, cold as fuck in summer even but insanely beautiful, fishing there is amazing, took us about 5min to catch enough fish for dinner everyday, we even got a 45kg sei once
“verandere das Leben von Millionen”
Is this a real ad
it's a "typo". Probably deliberate
Schuss means shot
Title is misleading
What the Danish political party says is that if wants the EU to use sanctions against countries enforcing a trade embarco against French products
So it has nothing to do with private citizens in foreign countries deciding to not buy French products
It is a tool to use if the leaders (dictators) of a nation declares a trade embarco against France
Je suis Charlie
Denmark stands with France
Religion should be forbidden in European soil, we're already a prosperous and highly educated continent, we don't need these primitive ideas anymore
Denmark kicked off the first Muhammad cartoon controversy, so we should be the first to support you
Denmark's been in the same crises you guys have
It was called the Muhammed-crisis

Chocolate manufacturers should use this for advertisement, ending it with "This is probably just a coincidence, but the great taste certainly isn't."

A cooking show made a sketch about it
Did you see that time Denmark created Denmark in Minecraft in a 1:1 scale
That was rad
With all the buildings and everything
You could  literally teleport to your home address and check out your house like google streetview
But in Minecraft
Is this created with some kind of software or did you actually sit in Minecraft and place blocks
Safe to say you love Italy
The EU have given May leeway in negotiations, because they had a good relationship

I can't believe ~~80~~50,5% of the Turkish population in Denmark voted *for* the current regime

Well that's a given when you can either vote Erdogan or serve jailtime
Thing is, the rest of Europe grew up, while the countries that still try to put rules on love are stuck in the playpen eating glue

The Danish (and probably also others) way: If salmonella is detected in a chicken farm, ~~AOL~~ all of the chickens are destroyed
Result: Danish chickens are considered salmonella free and therefore there is no warning against using raw eggs in food for people who are in normal health
We do refrigerate our eggs, but I think that's just to keep them fresh longer and/or is just how it has always been
Why isn't he asking the real question
Like, why does all stores put a rubberband around my carton of eggs
so do we have no salmonella or do we have "no salmonella"?
I chose a dvd for tonight
I must have an AOL CD ROM somewhere
I heard they were everywhere
We just like to play it safe
In the link our experts basically says that all things kept cold will stay fresh longer therefore it is better to keep the eggs in the fridge
regardless of what everybody else does
They are kept in the fridge in the shops too
Both, we dont, untill someone find some
Iirc we have more salmonella in pigs than chickens
You can get eggs from other places than Denmark
It might have been true once, but not today
Just my guess
The department for food, fishing and agriculture first pulled their warning against eating raw eggs in 2013 (and I am pretty sure they pulled back a couple of laws about companies serving food with raw egg just last year) so year pretty recent development
So it's clearly Sweden who are the weirdos in this scenario
Glad we got that settled

That bike lane seems really unsafe
Functionalism took over
I read that as 1980
Was confused
Sigh
It seems that it actually is for a stretch leading up to the red-painted bit
I was more referring to the fact that it seems that bikes have to cross a bus/turn lane to get to the bike-exclusive red lane
Those are a recipe for disaster
There are a couple in Copenhagen too, but they are all regulated with traffic lights (with the exception of one that I can think of)
Once the red bit starts, it looks decent since it has a curb
Is it far from Santiago de Compostela
Is it just me or is this a bad map/legend
There is no indication of what a place is
You could call Europe a place and colour it all yellow
I doubt  Schleswig-Holstein  is that spread out
I think the data from Denmark is incorrect or old
There are lot of towns i cannot find that I know for a fact has +1000 inhabitants
Is that because there is a difference in population density or difference in what constitutes a place, I wonder
Well it kinda is I guess
SH data probably shows municipalities > 1000 inhabitants, where the Danish data shows towns > 1000 inhabitants
In that way you would get a lot of rural localities with more than 1000 inhabitants
WTF
We did *not* ship all our best bacon and butter to you for the past 150 years just to come in seventh
Goddamn ingrates
I think *Neutral* (possibly combined with *Not heard of it*) creates an indication of noteworthiness, how much the Brits care about that country - a low rating means they care a lot
While the relationship between positive and negative then indicate how well they like that country
The NET Pos-Neg indication is also quite close to this
Naturally the UK would then be the most noteworthy country, but followed by Ireland as the 2nd most noteworthy country
In all of these lists whether they're important or not, i always look at whether or not we've beaten Sweden
You win this time you sunuvabitch
as a dane part norweigen and swede i am insulted that portugal isn't higher like does the longest alliance in the world not mean anything to you
That's not how I interpret "not heard of", but as what has that country done recently and people would not know as they "haven't heard anything", it doesn't mean whether or not the country exists
nobody knows what Estonia is
Of course you are, look, Denmark is right there
Yes well, you've kind of ruined that reputation a bit lately
You can't be sure that that is how it is to be understood
It is much more likely they haven't heard anything new or from that country, so they can't place themselves in either positive, negative or neutral
Not for me
Paid rioters
Is this the Soros thing i've been hearing about
Oh my god, you're making me blush
Isn't there also a group of countries including scandinavia and a few countries to the right of sweden
That really depends on what people in their minds put in front or after the sentence "haven't heard of".
, "I haven't heard of anything recent that would change my view on country1 one way or the other".
Besides these questionnaires are often done by phone, so it isn't the person who answers who put down their own answers but someone else
Thanks
Yeah, it's them, I seached scandinavia and baltic and the word I was looking for was baltoscandia, aparently
No idea why they're grouped together, I just remembered that there was a name for it
Also, sorry, I forgot there wasn't a map in the photo
I wouldn't. I would settle down somewhere in Scandinavia where the weather isn't too hot and unbearable
[I recorded a gif of the fisting incident after seeing the video on a danish news site
Honestly, I love how smoothly he transitions from a handshake to a fist bump while walking in
I also love how happy the policeman looks, giving a lil' nod to his co-worker with the biggest grin on his face
Sure if you're like 4
Øbåmæ
Øøh, politimand is the default word for a cop here in Denmark, so I'd consider the direct translation, policeman, to be apt given the context
Calling a danish policeman a cop, would be the equivalent of calling him a strømer, strisser or panser
I don't really know if we have a proper direct translation of police officer though
Politi officer

No:
Another kind of Danish:

What the fuck
Flying into the us I overheard one guy mumble to another "America is truly the land of fat asses
" In Danish and pointing at the rear of the woman in front of them
She casually looked over her shoulder and replied "Thats true, but this ass is from Århus".
Not the wisest thing to say in an airport
and you just got off a plane from Denmark
I used to feel this way, but nowadays I seem to be randomly running into Danes whenever I go abroad @_@"
Except for other danes
And although Denmark's a tiny country, we are *everywhere*.
The potato thing is actually something i mostly only hear swedes say
And when i hear Swedes who is bad at danish trying to speak danish it does indeed sound like you guys have a potato in your mouth
oh well just speak English then
It's easier for everyone concerned
Well, held og lykke :)

I caught 3 danish guys in Japan saying racist shit about the Japanese back when I lived there
So yeah, you never know
That entire "documentary" was a huge joke, intended to make fun of North Korea, while in North Korea
If the government had a translator, the 3 of them wouldn't ever have been able to leave the country
Worked at a Føtex in copenhagen, was always awfull when semi drunk swedes tried to speak Swedish to me, always had to ask if we could swap over to english
You just bought thousand liters milk
I married a girl from the island of Bornholm
It took me years of practice and help to be able to follow family conversations when we were visiting her parents
At her parent's wedding anniversary they had to split the party into "those who understand Bornholmsk" and "those who don't". I'm not kidding either
I hope not, that's grounds for execution in old-USA

"semi drunk Swedes"?
- Just say "Swedes", it's faster and we all know that's how it is
Men det gjorde de ikke
Roughly the same as "båtnakker", "vatnisser" or "skidesprællere".
Ass bananas
godnat og sov godt
You moved to Randers, ikk’?
I'll give it a go, but these are not particilarly easy to translate directly
"Båtnakker" - "båt" is more of a sound than an actual word
When we press the horn of a car we'd call the sound a "båt" (or more often a "dyt")
"Nakker" in this context means "necks" often referring to the back part of the neck
"Vatnisser" is more simple
"Vat" is cotton wool (those small puffy balls of cotton used to clean stuff), while nisser is the Danish words for elves (or sometimes pixies) - the small creatures that help Santa Claus
"Skidesprællere" is tougher, though
"At skide" means to shit and "at sprælle" means to wiggle or to writhe
So something like "shit wriggler". I don't know the origin of the word, but maybe someone who wriggles in shit
I'm sure someone can provide some better examples, but I hope this gives a (very) rough idea
If we are to be kind, maaaaybe B1: "Can produce simple connected text on topics that are familiar or of personal interest
It's just something people call it other as a silly insult
"You are an ass-banana". There's not a specific scenario where it makes sense to use it
I have never heard the word "buttneck" before, but that would make sense
Turns out Portugese and Australian has more in common than I first would've imagined

The undemocratic EU needs to reform or dissolve
We don't need anything more than a trade union
You're a good winner
just give us Gibraltar back already (from a Spaniard)
You mean the EU
When your friends are being dumbasses it is your duty to let them know they are being dumb
Denmark has a big export to UK
UK was seen as an ally on a lot of Danish positions in EU
And in the Danish populace Brits/UK'ers/English are seen as kindred (in a EU-context)
The general feeling is that we will miss you when you are out
21-25 is perfect
Mix it with some rain now and then and I'm in heaven
No warmer than this though
The nordic countries melt at 10 degrees just imagine how we are feeling right now
I don't like it, anything above 18 is horrible when you have to work at the office
This heat makes me want to drive off a cliff
Unfortunately the nearest cliff is on the other side of the country, and no way in hell am I driving all the way over there in this heat
Please take it back
It's far too hot, and summer has only started
KILL MEEE
What i wouldn’t do to be in austria
Damn
Denmark is as hot as Egypt
Bruh we moved to a new classrom in my school and its 30 degrees celsius, no air conitioners, but we do have windows but we have some of the most annyoing girls in our class that keeps closing them because they think its cold or something
Yea fuck you mathilde, you karen
I love summer
Could be altitude difference
Lots of mountains up there
Yup, same here
I'm from 1980 and I remember a few of those "Crazy heat" summers because they actually stood out
Then again, I also remember building snowmen, snow caves in drifts etc
That sure as shit hasn't been possible for quite a while now
Fuck no
Spring > Autumn > > > Summer > Winter
Can you please call it "efterår", not autumn
Autumn is for Anglos because they can't say efterår
It's warmer in Finland, so you're already dead then
Same here, unfortunately we barely even have winters anymore it seems
I remember building big snowmen, caves in snow drifts etc
as a child but that sure as shit hasn't been possible for years now
I'm just not built for 25+ degrees, I'll often sit at the PC with my feet in a bucket of ice water just to cope
Exactly
It almost feels like the air is some semi-liquid thing when it's humid and hot
Just breathing feels weird
I've never had the same problem when I've been in Portugal, Greece etc
Obviously it's even warmer down there but it's a dry heat so you're "just" roasting
You can still breathe and it's not nearly as "sticky".
I can follow that as well
That was my opinion until I got a garden
There's just something lovely about Autumn
99% sounds about right
The last 1% can not read or write
English is what the comment thread mentions, but many Danes knows some or a lot of German, French, Spanish
There is 500000 foreign workers in Denmark presumably speaking a different language plus maybe Danish
Many speak or understand Swedish and Norwegian quite well (or not at all according to complainers)
The key issue here is people being asked if they can read, write and understand a second language
Norwegian is a second language, and the written Norwegian and Danish is practically the same
Surprising that my country's top of the list
Guess that's how things are
People from Malta speak English and Italian
or what is the second language
HVOR ER SVENSKEN

KOM SÅ DANMARK, KOM SÅ
Denmark big, Denmark stronk, Denmark overconfident in his abilities
I can't help but imagine Denmarks statistic might've been helped by Faroe Islands and Greenland who have mandatory Danish and English on top of their native Faroese and Inuit
I'm so glad i live in Denmark and not germany
Having been on vacation in germany / austria all their synchronized televsion is a nightmare
It's awesome being bilingual (semi trilingual)
English or French I guess
In Denmark it is english
I was surprised to find out that today english is mandatory from the first grade of elementary school (I believe it was 4th grade in my time)
French or german becomes mandatory in 5th grade
It is also possible to select spanish as an elective (or have both french and german where one is an elective), or other languages if the school offers it
>instead of words like ATM they use words like Bank Machine(translating Estonian word into English)
That's because English unlike most other languages likes to use words that doesn't describe e.g. the item well
In Denmark it is English followed by French and/or German
At least back when I was in school, it was up to the student what dialect of English they wanted to go with; British, American, etc, as long as it was consistent
That consistency could be a problem when you were learning British english in class, but picking up American english vocabulary from tv
In denmark its (from what i know) english, followed by german, french, spanish and chinese
English and one of those other languages are mandetory in ground school
Pretty much this
Most of Danish kids learn German in school (some learn French or Spanish instead), and last time we were in Berlin on vacation my daughter stated that "Germany is a lot nicer when you realize that you don't *actually* have to speak German
Just find a person under 30, and they'll happily speak English
I doubt 30% of their population are immigrants so obviously somebody was lying
Mind geblown
To expand on the other comments, from this sentence on wikipedia it sounds like locks would have used too much water during summer to be an option:
>The planned canal bridge over the Elbe, necessary to avoid low water conditions in summer, was not built due to the Second World War
What's up with France
How reliable is this information
Is this among the entire population or only among the bourgeois
Just one of the many reasons for why the Russian revolution happened
RemindMe
7 years
Yeah
You know people, that cliff exists because the water eats the rock at the bottom
And the the rock on top of the missing rock falls down, leaving a sheer cliff
Which means that the ground at the edge at the top of the cliff is not expected to stay where it is
So building on the edge is a VERY BAD IDEA
Haven't had a "robocall" before (From Denmark), but I do get loads of calls from various call-centers
Luckily enough, there only really seems to be 2-3 numbers calling me from time to time, so they just get added to my list of blocked numbers
...and they sure as hell don't give a fuck about the calling hours
The last one I picked up (maybe a year ago, I think), was at around 23:00
I've had some a few years back, that called earlier than the listed time on that chart as well
Edit: Just looked through my blocked call - last one I received was actually yesterday (so on a Sunday) :/
For most people sure, but some people dont see well, so it being a call is a nice option
Thats why its a nice option, as in you dont have to, but you can

I am visiting France - can confirm, it’s hot at shit at the very moment
Thanks but no thanks
Yeeeah this is one list I'm cool ^^^^heh with being near the bottom of
Scandinavia not topping a list, this must be an error in the measurements
Right
It's 28° here in Copenhagen and I feel like I'm melting
I'm pretty sure anything above 40° would literally kill me
Countries like Iceland, Denmark, Norway, Ireland and UK will probably never reach 40 degrees, there's simply to much coastline to cool the air
Same reason why places located at Northern Africas tip never really gets "that hot", the Mediterranean Sea cools it down
Now theres another problem with climate change
As more ice melts the currents might change
Now if the Gulf Stream changes or worse, ceases to exist, we might see another Ice age
Then Iceland will actually be a land of Ice
It's scary how many of these records are from year 2000 and after

Long Live United Deutschland ! Greetings from Denmark
Last year my girlfriend and I went to Hungary, Slovakia, Austria, the Czezh Republic and Germany for a few weeks and it was definitely way cheaper to just hop on buses (we used Flixbus and RegioJet) instead of getting an Interrail Pass
Unless you go around eastern Europe
Interrail is quite good from Prague and onwards IMO
Interrail works for all trains *except* in your own country
It does entitle you to a reduced fare in your own country, though
Night trains and high-speed trains usually have mandatory seat reservations, which must be paid on top of the normal price
For most countries, the seat reservations on high-speed trains are somewhere between 10 and 30 €. However, all high-speed ICE trains in Germany do not require seat reservations (unless they are cross-border services to France) and all Railjet services in Austria and the surrounding countries also do not require reservations (unless they cross the border to Hungary)
Also, the Eurostar is not included *at all* in the Interrail pass
It is sometimes cheaper to take a flight across the channel rather than a train
These old fucks will soon die off and maybe we'll see England come back to sensible hands
And soon as they’re actually leaving “hey we’re bringing them back
Wait, what do they *want* you to book with then
Mailing them a bag of coins
The EU expansion and the speed of it were British positions/decisions though
1) the UK always pushed for expanding the EU faster, this decision was made at EU level, but with the UK being the most influential strong supporter
2) Within the EU agreement it was possible to limit the number of immigrants from new countries for a number of years
The UK made an entirely sovereign decision not to do this (unlike many other countries such as my own)
Swedes just have to ruin everything good

When dealing with skewed distributions, the median will sometimes be a better measure as it ignores e.g. the billionaires - people I assume you didn’t mean to compare yourself to
I am glad that you have finally come to accept our rightful possession of Norway and calculate our income as one
Denmark missing
Denmark has declared bankrupcy
OP made a follow up comment saying it was 3270, which isn't bad at all
T R I G G E R E D
Does it matter
As long as there is data for Sweden and Germany the Danes will shuffle along on the same track or on the nearby trail higher up while thinking life is good but could Always be better (if you were a complaining Dane that wasted time on such a strange thinking)
Uhm
Okay, could you rephrase that somehow
Danes will complain about anything while at the same time keep saying they think life is good
Since we share roughly the same political ideology management of Sweden and our currency is pegged to the largest trading partner (Euro now, but the peg was to the Deutsche Mark belonging to Germany and we still worship at the German alter of austerity and close watch on the economy
My point is Denmark will be in the income neighborhood of Sweden and the economic performance of Germany
No need to know or guess the exact number, just know it is the ball park of the other two nations
Oh sweet summer child
You don't know how bad Greece has shit the bed
Sounds reasonable
Would be nice to know however, especially since it has a different color than Sweden and Germany
Price level is higher in Denmark, so what you can buy for that wage difference between Denmark and Sweden is tiny
Also, "kerfufle". Holy shit man, where'd you even find that word
You clearly didn't pay close enough attention if you think that they are better off than Lithuania
Lithuania is slowly gaining ground as far as I've heard, investing in IT sector growth and whatnot
It's a shame that your politicians think that they can control the bleeding of highly qualified workers by making punitive laws against emigration, but you're still far off Greece levels of being royally fucked
Greece currently exists at the mercy of other countries
This may all be well and true, and thanks for the explanation, but it doesn't make it any less of an error :)
No, what you’ve seen is tourist areas in a warm country with wealthy foreigners buying property
You can see the same shit all along the southern part of Europe, that doesn’t make those countries rich
Also, anecdotes aren’t exactly a strong comeback to facts and figures
Again, which millionaires are moving to Lithuania
Also, if you go to the outskirts of Lithuania you can find a fair share of drunkards who make virtually no money, but that’s mostly leftovers of a post-occupation fallout
Greece’s economy is thoroughly fucked all throughout the whole country
Their government is on the verge of a collapse
There’s plenty of high skilled workers fleeing the country because of jobs disappearing
Also, yeah, I see the irony of this being unsupported claims, but I am too busy to back this up at the moment
Furthermore
“itinerary”?
Shit, I’m gonna need a thesaurus
The implication of the first part was that Greece's numbers are inflated by the amount of people moving their businesses there exclusively to enjoy the weather
This accounts for a large portion of Spain's alleged income, for example
As for Greece recovering, I am skeptical, but can't prove shit
As for the rest
Fuck me, you're probably right
Part of me just really wants to believe that Lithuania will crawl back into a nicer spot once the post-occupation PTSD workforce retreats into pension
Also, my impression is that Lithuanian residents move out of the luxury of wanting a higher pay for the same jobs, rather than actually having to, due to jobmarkets collapsing there
I could be wrong, though
I think Lithuania will be fine once the newer generations start to establish businesses and spurring real growth in the country, but it's a matter of time

And as the curtain falls, what is more appropriate, than to look back at the year that passed, here on our little corner of reddit
As always, I want to start off this "Christmas-card" by talking about how it is to be a moderator on the subreddit
And as always, I am going to say that it has been a great year
I am so extremely happy for the community to have developed the way it has
The camaraderie and fellowship it has, the openness to both the most ridiculous questions, and to more serious questions
It is an absolute joy to be a part of, and I am sure the other moderators feel the same way
While it was a rocky start, the subreddit finally got our new discord-server up and running back in Spring
We have a healthy, albeit small, but welcoming, part of the subreddit community hanging out on the server, sharing memes, discussing current events, and just talking about life, in great and small
You're all welcome to come join, [here's a link]
The community has grown quite a bit
And by quite a bit, I mean it has grown a lot
We've more than doubled our number of members, from just around 35 000 users, to almost 80 000 users
It is absolutely amazing to think about
If we continue to grow by this rate, we'll hit 100 000 in no time
Welcome to all of our new members, who've decided to join us this year
As we're rounding off this year, and readying ourselves for the future, I want to, on behalf of all the moderators, just once more wish you a very merry Christmas and a happy New Year
This year I want to share a Danish Christmas Carol
or kinda Danish
Because it's written by a Danish poet over the words of a German monk, set to the tune of a Silesian Christmas-song
[_Det kimer nu til julefest_]
I think after Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign there has been a general need to explain that Denmark, nor any other of the Nordic countries, are, by even the most revisionist or utopian definitions of the term, "socialist". Explaining how the extensive Nordic welfare model is spearheaded by liberals, conservatives, and socialists alike, is always fun
>!The Nordic model isn't particularly 'Social Democratic' for that matter either
Another thing is perhaps the relation between the size and how manoeuvrable the country is
I've often met tourists who come to either Copenhagen, Århus or Odense, and expect to use one of those cities as a "base of operations" in order to see the whole country(Barred Bornholm, because it's as remote as it is)
And while this definetely is _possible_, it's not advisable, simply because of how spread out the different sites are, and how hard it is to traverse the country using public transport
You'd often have to travel back on yourself in order to get from a to b. Renting a car makes it easier, but it's still hard
A third, and final one that sticks out, is explaining social cues
There's a stereotype about Nordic people generally being a-social
And while we often joke about it, it couldn't be farther from the truth
We don't hate engaging with each other, or with strangers, quite contrary
There's just a time and a place for it
> "they banned guns and freedom of speech, thus they were left"
The thing is, the Nazis actually encouraged male German citizens to own guns, and do shooting and hunting and such
I wouldn't necessarily call it 'dangerous', as the sentiment is already tied to the simplified and sometimes misleading political compass; only if the decision-making is made based on the compass, rather than on ideas and values, it becomes a problem
I think it's hard to find people who vote for the right-wing because it's the right-wing, and the left because it's the left
Recent election results all over Europe have shown that people are more than happy to jump from parties regarded as one place on the spectrum, to a party on a completely other side
Example: The exodus of social democratic votes to national conservative populist parties
[givment]
Excuse me, but what do you mean
In handwriting I write cursive, so I guess it's more like
_α_. But generally α is the most common form, nobody really learns to write a, not even in print
Ugly as hell, but that's just my [handwriting
Looks fine to me
No worries
O's are tied together with other letters at the top in Danish cursive
There are some o's around the page to show it
Hi /u/D_Redacted
To get a userflair, depending on whether or not you use old or new reddit, there are two options:
If you're using old reddit:
Go to the sidebar, and just below the community counters, there should be an option that says "Show my flair on this subreddit
It looks like:", or something similar
If you're using new reddit:
There is a drop-down menu below the "create new post" button
Opening it, you should see the option to add a user flair
Hope this helps
We've designed a completely new banner for the community – Isn't that enough
Since our Czech mod left, defenestrations have been off the table

ouch
Well
I believe that such a nationality, because that is what a 'European identity' would mean, with its own nationalism, etc
could be constructed, sure
The historian and pol
scientist Benedict Anderson argues in his 1983 book _Imagined Communities_ that nations "[are] imagined because the members of even the smallest nation will never know most of their fellow-members, meet them, or even hear of them, yet in the minds of each lives the image of their communion".
If a project of building a modern pan-European (national) identity succeeded, through media, administrative integration, cultural assimilation and integration, etc
etc
, I could easily see it arise as an part of the reproduction of modern liberal-capitalist Europe
Perhaps more out of necessity of the production, than of want of the people
Do I personally feel "European" at all
I hardly even feel Danish
I recognise that socially, I am Danish, but if I had the means to do so, I'd happily shed my layer of socialised nationalism, and instead live as an internationalist, to the bone
All I can do now, and actively do, is to work and act as an internationalist
I believe that _class_, rather than nations, should be the prime identification of people
We should recognise each other as peers (if we happen to be so), and recognise that we may not share interests with those of the other classes, even if we share 'nations'. As of right now, I feel I have more in common with another working class individual from Bologna or Bangkok, than with a director from Gentofte
It'd be weird _not_ to have a Danish flag, in Denmark
The Danish flag is used at all occasions
It's flown on all holidays, on all memorial days, at sporting events, at jubilees, on birthdays, weddings, baptisms, confirmations, on Christmas Eve, etc
It's used as decoration on Christmas trees, on birthday-cakes, on gift-wrappings, and a ton of more stuff
People who say American flag-use is excessive obviously have never been to Denmark
That said, we don't do many flag-pins like in the US
They're pretty common in super-market decorations
Especially when there's a sale going on(Which there always is)
Perhaps not in individual classrooms, but most schools have flags
Well
I'm not talking about the political use of the American flag
I'm talking about the private and commercial uses of our flags compared
The Danish flag is a crusader-banner which our kings just chose to use as their personal banner (with or without the consent of the Church), so it's a bunch of crosses
Like sure, the symbolism is more tied to Easter, but it's still somewhat Jesus-related
All holidays are public flag-days and the public masts are covered in flags
With memorial days I meant occupation 09/04, liberation 05/05, and "the day of the deployed" which is like septembre
Personally I despise our use of the flag, I find it too extreme
I'm an internationalist and I want to avoid using flags as much as possible
You're _all_ VIP's to us
Yea
I used to live in Stavtrup until recently, funnily enough
Luckily I've been able to move into the city centre now
I don't think it's fairly political
AFAIK it's common across the main political divide in the US
The Stars and Stripes seems to be one of the unifying things, and even when politicised, such as at protests, it's used by both the left and the right
Like, even the Socialist movement in the US actively uses the Star Spangled banner alongside their red flags
Because I disagree with the symbolism
As said, I'm an internationalist
I think where we disagree is on what the use of the flags mean
I don't buy that the Danish use of the flag should carry different meanings, rather, I believe it reproduces similar ideological lines as the American use
Internationalism: Unity across national boundaries and active opposition to any form of nationalism
Globalism: Global networks and interconnections particularly in trade and politics
It's literally the national symbol, and the symbol of the state
It reproduces and in its modern use finds root in the liberal concept of nationalism
"And active opposition to any form of nationalism"
As a symbol it still reproduces nationalism when used privately
Just like celebrating Christmas despite being the most ardent atheist oneself still reproduces religious aspects
That's... kinda the point with internationalism
That the people of the world should unite across nationalist boundaries to advance their common interests
Nations are an ideological construct as you said yourself, based on symbols and traditions
The real, material, division of people is the division based on economical class
I think you fundamentally misunderstand the concept
Underage drinking isn't a thing in Denmark, as we have no legal drinking age
It's 100% legal to drink as a 10-year old(although those serving the alcohol may or may not face legal repercussions depending on the context)
What there are restrictions on however, is the purchase of alcohol
Most people start drinking around age 15-16, and with the purchasing age of light alcoholic beverages being 16, it's roughly the same
Generally people are pretty light around it, and kids are often offered light beers as kids, and proper beers at the Confirmation(age 13), but very few actually start drinking regularly at those ages
Well
The case for Denmark at least is easy to make
At least if you're some sort of 'lefty' like me:
_Full disclaimer before you read my comment: I am an ardent socialist
I have been Union Rep
I am organised, even now, while studying, I am active in the labour movement
My comment will reflect this
It is not meant to be a neutral comment
* Even the poorest and the workers are heavily taxed, despite our 'progressive' tax system
In the last 20 or so odd years, liberal and social democratic governments alike, the tax-burden has been lightened for the richest, and spread to the broader population, dis-proportionally affecting those already weakest in society
* Cost of living is through the roof, with rents continuing to rise, effectively gentrifying the largerst cities, which is where there is acces to education and high-paying jobs, further dividing the centres and peripheries of the country
* The state has become increasingly centralised, thus, in continuation of above, the 'peripheral' municipalities are losing their opportunities to try and help themselves, and rely increasingly on the central government, removing the, once extensive, autonomy municipalities had
* The liberals have had great succes undermining trade-unions the last 20 years, which, because of the succes of so-called 'yellow' or 'ideologically alternative'(read 'liberal') trade-unions, have led to labour been overall weakened when it comes to collective bargaining
This means wages have stagnated, or fallen, for many workers, not to mention, Denmark is a country without much labour-legislation, so a lot of rights and securities have disappeared as well
* Education and academia has become increasingly watered out, with lack of funding
This has led to gymnasiums and universities in many cases turning into nothing but pipe-lines for certain jobs, and leave young people with ever more limited options
Trade-schools have it hard as well, as they also lack proper funding, and because of the insecurities tied to many of the trades, have a hard time attracting students
* Most government transfer-payments have been reduced to only the bare minimums, often not even enough to reproduce daily life
The liberal government abolished the national measure of poverty, _fattigdomsgrænsen_, in 2015, just two years after it was introduced, but _if_ it was still in place, we would have seen an increase of poverty in Denmark
* Integration of immigrants and refugees has, overall, not been a succes-story, and instead of building an integration-system that works, governments have, since the 1990'es, instead created ever harsher quotas and made it harder for people to integrate, pushing away the necessary immigrant labour for our domestic industries, allowing it to be replaced with often black-leg or unorganised foreign labour, which, in the former case doesn't pay taxes, or in the latter case, further undermine trade-unions and collective bargaining
Those are just the ones at the top of my head
I could think of more, if I wanted to
Oh yea
Most definitely
Don't get me started on how much I hate the way we put pineapple in our own juice as soon as anyone dares question anything about Denmark: "_But it's better than [somewhere else]_"
Also the politician thing
_God_, I wish we would have more fist-banging, high-yelling principled politicians who actually believed in their beliefs, instead of politicians posting about their morning runs or home baked bread on Instagram
Unlike /u/22dobbeltskudhul I see change as a possibility
Despite being a socialist, I refuse to see socialism as simply the negation of capitalism
Class conflict is a process, and as such it's also possible to reignite progressive change
One of the key parts in doing this is to strengthen the organisations of the working class: everything from sports-associations to trade-unions and political parties
Building a new one of the latter if necessary
It will also be necessary to rekindle class alliances and re-building the political hegemony on the left that working class interests enjoyed in the past; to reconcile the growing split between workers and intelligentsia, which has been spurred on by anti-intellectual rhetoric from the social democratic side in particular
It means to offer a new programme, focused on socialisation and practical socialism, redistribution, strengthening the 'Red' unions, and simply expanding and strengthening existing social policies ([such as including dental in the national health service] not to mention changing the tax-burden around, placing taxes on capital and other forms of 'dead wealth'(inheritance, land, etc
), creating better rights for renters, and simply offering an ideological alternative to various forms of liberalism
Depending on how we view the 'near' future, I'd say that this is very much possible
Also before I turn 50 (which is in 28 years time)
Will the necessary change come quicker and easier in Denmark than elsewhere
I don't know
I don't think Denmark, or the Nordic countries necessarily, have been a hotbed for progress
We haven't. It's a false impression
We're just as conservative as the rest of Europe, we just don't legislate based on it
But the 'tocsin of world revolution' (to use a 19th century expression) will always flow from somewhere, and this somewhere _can_ very well become Denmark
It's not really uncivilised as it is just old-fashioned
The traditions and rules of the British parliament, both chambers, are among the oldest traditions and rules of all parliamentary systems
Like, *in theory*, the House of Commons can only operate lawfully when the royal mace, dating from the reign of Charles II, is present at the table
But you're right
They are more rowdy than in other countries
Except perhaps Ukraine, where I know for a fact, there has been a least two fist-fights involving more than 3 MP's in the last 10 years
We do in Denmark as well
It's because we're taught, at least in Denmark, to walk on the left, so that oncoming traffic easier can see us, and have space to avoid us
This then translates onto sidewalks too, for some reason
I don't think so, no
Generally American politics and mainstream culture stands for everything that I am opposed to, besides there is a severe lack of jobs for people in my field, outside of teaching, which I by no means am interested in
Not to mention the politics: The US is far too liberal for me
The electorate system has resulted in two parties coming out on top: both of them Liberal, not to mention that in many parts of the country, on a state level, there's legislation which makes living in those areas as
my kind of person
difficult or unpleasant
And while the social situation is improving, and there's started to come some much needed non Liberal ideas in mainstream American politics, it's simply not good enough, and much of it is watered down by compromising with liberals on key issues
I strongly dislike Liberals, if that wasn't clear by now
And then comes the distance from friends and family: and while I'm sure that _if_ I ended up in the US, I'd be able to find new friends, and perhaps start a family of my own, it'd just be weird having to travel more than 15 hours just to visit my sister
Nope
I mean Liberal, as broad as that term is
Referring to social liberals, liberal conservatives, right-libertarians, classical liberals, etc
It is the liberal ideology I am opposed to, and all subsets of it(to varying degrees ofc
; we need to be a little nuanced as well)
Eeeeehhhh
that's an oversimplification and a half, isn't it
Like, Liberal is much broader than that, and I mean it in the broadest possible way
I'm also opposed to compromising with the Radical party here at home, as an example(It was even part of the reason I left the Social Democratic Party)
From what I hear and read, 'liberal' means exactly the same here as there
They just use it to refer to a broader party, and associate it with that, than necessarily the broad ideology, which, in this context, is the way I am using it
Ideological terms do not change meaning like that
I'm not opposed to comprising at all
I'm opposed to the direction that the recent(meaning post-Schlüter) compromises with the Liberals have dragged Denmark
There are plenty of compromises before that I agree with, and want to see more of
If the compromises made politically had been more pro-labour, I would have no problem with it; the problem is that it seems like we've reached a point where the Liberals are more than happy, or on some points even opposed to, the status-quo, resulting in them dragging "the opposite" way, a distinctly more liberal direction
And when the Social Democratic Party then chooses to sacrifice their pro-labour stance in return of the PM-position, then I get a problem with it
And I dont believe the point of a multi-party system is compromise
Compromise often is a result of multi-party systems, but it isn't, and shouldn't be, the rule
The goal of a liberal parliamentary system with proportionate representation is exactly that: proportionate representation
And if a compromise isn't possible, I dont believe we should attempt to force one
... You're not reading what I am writing
You're arguing only partly within the fields I am arguing within, hence we're talking around each other
I am saying that in the broadest meaning of the word 'liberalism' I am opposed to that certain ideological direction
Which, by the way, also includes Social Liberalism, and for that matter 'Liberal Socialism'.
When I write pro-labour, I'm not talking about welfare-policies or rights or anything like that, I am talking in sociological and ideoligical terms, as I have been from the beginning, and have been very clear about from the get-go
This means that when I talk about 'liberalism' in the context of politics, I am also in extension talking about the sociological concept of superstructure(as opposed to the economical base)
You're not addressing my points, as you're only accounting for half of my argument, hence the confusion, I believe
This means that when I am talking about being pro-labour, I am talking about the ideologies that are not the dominant ideology, not the superstructure, but rather are pro-labour in that they aim for a change in ideology from a liberal ideology to an ideology for the continuation of the emancipation of the labouring class
> How, in your view, is the labouring class not emancipated yet
In my view, emancipation of the labouring class, and the personal freedom that modern liberalism promotes go hand in hand
I am talking about economical emancipation, meaning freedom from economical exploitation
Within this sociological understanding of exploitation, it is part of the redistribution of labour, taking place during the process of separate groups exchanging their current productive labour for social labour set in goods received
The labour given towards production is embodied in the commodities or other wares and exploitation occurs when someone purchases a good, with their revenue or wages, for an amount unequal to the total labour he or she has put forth
This labour executed by a group over a given period of time is the same as the labour embodied to the goods that make up the Net National Product
The NNP is then divided out to the members of the group in some way and this is what creates the two groups involved in the exchange of goods: exploiters and exploited(Meaning the labouring-class)
The exploiters is the group able to command goods, with dividends from their wages, that are manifested with more labour than the exploiters themselves have performed, based on the exploitative social relations as described above
These groups often have an economical status, primarily ownership or other form of control of productive assets that aid the optimisation of the described exploitation
At the same time, the exploited group  is made up of those that receive less than the average product they produce
This means that if workers are paid an amount equivalent to their average product, there would be no revenue left and thus the workers cannot enjoy the fruits of their own labours meaning the difference between what is made and what that amount can purchase cannot be justified by redistribution according to their needs
> This is, I presume, the same way I am opposed to the ideological direction of Socialism
Not really
Again, this is tied to the concept of base and superstructure
Within this context 'liberalism' refers to the superstructure, to the in society dominant religious, legal, and political systems
And within our current economical status-quo, the current materialist conditions, aka the economical base(Hence why we talk about base and superstructure), we see that the liberal ideology prevails(in various forms, that is granted, noone in their right mind would argue that the form it takes in Germany is the same as the form it takes in Peru, yet both are, in the broad sense of the word, liberal)
The exploiting group from above determine the superstructure of society and the nature of the justifying ideology, meaning the  actions feasible because the exploiting class control the productive assets of our society
This means that as a part of maintaining the social status-quo, it is important the ideology; it politically confuses the exploited groups of society via what sociologists call false consciousness
> [...] the key to a successful democracy is one, where everybody's opinion matters, and thus compromises is at the core of the process and an extremely important part of how the country is run
Perhaps, but I don't think you believe this should mean we should all compromise on our views at all times, do you
There is the ongoing border-conflict fought with booze and flags, that Denmark is waging on behalf of Greenland, with Canada, over the uninhabited isle of Tartupaluk
It's more of a fun gimmick, I guess, than any real official relation, but the border is disputed
I'd say that despite not being "in the middle" of anything, most people would consider western Jutland, perhaps more specifically northern western Jutland, to be in "the middle of nowhere". There are no major towns or cities around, and not really any major cultural, historical, or economical sites either
The largest towns being Struer and Holstebro, and the prime industry fishing and agriculture
_Edit:_ Another contender for the price could be Lolland-Falster, two islands south of Zealand, famed for their lack of economical growth, bad infrastructure, high unemployment, etc
That said, it's pretty close to Copenhagen still, and isn't really a traditional border-region like Jutland, nor traditionally presented as an "other", unlike Jutes, who've often been presented as a special subset of Danes(considering we used to be a separate people, it's only fair)
_Edit II:_ [Here's a map with the areas circled] Because of the tourism industry, Bornholm isn't really seen as being "the middle of nowhere", despite being isolated from the rest of the country
Neither really
like, I'm grouped into Danes because of how I am socialised, but I am not actively identifying as a Dane
In continuation of this, identifying with region/city levels isn't really a thing that much in Denmark
I identify the most with class
as it is at least materially identifiable
Yes
I think that tradition, and particularly big holidays and rituals of passing, are great for understanding how deeply religiosity is rooted in culture
Death however is special
As others have said, it's also a way for many of coping
And having been submerged in a christian-religious culture for their entire life, choosing christian-religious coping methods (or vulgar-Christianity in terms of the recently passed going directly to heaven), comes the most natural for most
So while people may not be "actively" religious, or believers or whatever, religiosity still is so deeply ingrained in the cultural fabric of societies, and really show that secularism hasn't penetrated into culture (yet)
Housing is often of poor or sub-par quality, some areas are very densely build up, a lot of infrastructure is lacking or very old (not necessarily roads, I'm of the belief cities should be build for pedestrians and bikes), housing can be very expensive to have upkeep of, etc
etc
Nope
Nowadays, most Danish dialects are sufficiently subtle, that most people can understand most other
The generations where dialects were incomprehensible, and learning "Danish of the Realm" was a necessity for, let's say, Southern Jutes, or people from Bornholm, are reaching at least pensioner's age, and even then, it's very likely that those from that generation don't speak with a pronounced dialect
It also helps that most Danish dialects aren't that hard to understand in the first place, with a few outliers
We don't have dialects that are outright incomprehensible to outsiders (except maybe Southern Jute
) Most of the time, it's more a question of rhythm and where the stress of particular words is placed, than vocabulary or the speed of talking
So do I, but they don't speak it to an incomprehensible degree, nor are have I ever experienced them being asked to "speak clearly" when in company of others
Just listen to a lot of Niels Hausgaard, you'll pick it up eventually ;)
But yea, usually those with the _thicc'est_ dialects switch 'naturally', or how to put it, I completely agree
Yea, you're right
It's vendelbomål... Well, it can't hurt to try
One of the reasons I haven't moved to Cph yet, I just know that despite my dialect being so minor (Djursbomål), people are still going to pick it up
I've never thought of the dialects from any of those regions as aggressive, and the "unintelligent" thing is some elitist bullcrap
Like, have the Copenhageners even heard their own dialect
They speak super slow
and like, being slow typically is a "nice" way to say something else
I guess the worst I've experienced is that people don't understand when I say things like 'kimse' or 'møjet' and stuff like that
But again, people think it's more "cute" than anything
Yea, it's a way of framing people from places like Randers or Hjørring as particularly "backwards". IMO, it's disgusting
When I used to engage in youth politics (Thank _fuck_ I don't do that anymore) it was extremely prevalent
People from "provincial" areas would take on almost mocking dialects (think Fritz and Poul from _Rytteriet_) in order to not be called out as "less".
It's also a way, I feel, that many Copenhagener progressives "write off" having to deal with people outside of Copenhagen, because they are 'just backward' and need leadership or some bs
Those who understand all dialects, and those who only understand their own
Also: What beer is best
Kinda like Austria most areas used to have their own beers, this was the case in Denmark as well, so now some areas are very entrenched in our choice of beer
#TeamCeres
Because why not
It's just as good an example as any else
Not at all
I am just fond of Austria
I like *being* in Austria and especially Vienna very much
I wouldn't move there, but I love visiting
Well
You can always find a place that serves either Gösser or Stiegl
A national passport
There is no doubt that an EU passport would be weaker than the Danish passport
Wouldn't it be _L'Internationale_ though
Like, _Ode to Joy_ is more just pan-European, while the other is
well
Internationalist
Can you name other internationalist movements than the Socialist movement though
But it has been adopted by the Pan-European movement(s) and the EU, leading it to simply rather have connotations of some modern continuation of liberal nationalism a la the 18th and 9th centuries, rather than carrying an actual internationalist meaning
Yea, but not internationalist
Most ideological movements are international, so I don't see the irony
Primarily the political ones like "overrun with muslims", "swedistan, amiright", "you can't even own a butterknife", etc
This ofc
also applies to things like when talking about welfare-policies in a positive light, as they often just as misinformed
There's no way of knowing exactly
The first domestic claim to "all of Denmark (and Norway)", is the Greater Jellinge Rune-stone, which is from the late 10th century, probably around 950-970
But we do have mentions of a "Denmark" from before that, in peace-treaties, geographical and historical works, etc
Passing the 1863 constitution
It was an obvious attempt at directly integrating the duchy of Slesvig into Denmark, breaking multiple international treaties and ending in a war
Never
Which is understandable, there would be very little weight behind such a claim
This is a question that requires
Some elaboration
First off: How do we understand the term 'socialism'? Do we understand it in a Leninist way, as a transitionary phase between capitalism and communism
Do we understand it in a Marxist fashion as a socialist mode of production, meaning a post-capitalist society
Do we understand it in an Utopian way, as a lesser defined "free and equal society"? Or how do we understand it
The way that it seems that Norberg understands it, is in a way that is associated with the command economies of the old soviet system, which, it is true, Sweden experimented with in the timespan from around the 1940'es until the 1970'es
So since the late 1970'es, the Swedish economy, the Swedish economy has been just as market oriented as most other western European states, and, since the fall of the so-called Eastern Bloc, also the 'Eastern'-European states
So if it _isn't_ socialism, and it isn't democratic socialism
What is it then
Well
**It is capitalist**. Sweden is, as all other states on Earth, a capitalist state
Capitalism here meaning 'a society dominated by the relations of capital'. Sweden has an economy based on private property, wage labour, commodity market exchange, etc
and has had, since capitalism arose from feudal relations
Where does the whole debacle of socialism then enter
It enters as either a deliberate rhetorical trick, or as a historical misunderstanding, or, perhaps as it often is, a little bit of both
Politicians like Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, and their supporters, frame socialism (in a vulgar way) here as _merely_ the progress of class struggle, such as in the fight for unionisation, higher wages, lower hours, etc
They frame socialism as _merely_ the establishment of welfare policies for the working class
And they use this framing to
well
I actually don't really know why they do it
I must make one point very clear here: Socialism is _not_ the mere progression of the class struggle
By that logic, we should label the liberals in the British parliament in the 19th century who passed [the various factory acts] as 'socialists'... Which makes no sense
What Sweden does have, is what sociologist Gøsta Esping-Andersen calls a 'Universal Welfare Model'. A universalistic welfare system that promotes an equality of high standards, rather than an equality of minimal needs
This implies decommodifying welfare services, to reduce the division introduced by market-based access to welfare services, as well as preemptively socialising the costs of caring for children, the aged, and the helpless, instead of then waiting until the family's capacity to support them is depleted
That's it
It's simply a welfare model, enacted in capitalist production, to help
negate, I guess, some of the more obvious problems of capitalism (but failing to attack and solve the real problems of capitalism as well)
Thank you for your comment
And thanks for the background of Norberg; I thought he was generally well-known, so I didn't include it
You're right my periodisation may be off by a margin, though with the
comparably large amount of control that the Swedish government had over Swedish industry _into_ the 1970'es, it's not a stretch to apply like I did
but you're absolutely right, that it can be discussed
> Many people who call themselves "socialist" today are not suggesting the complete abolishing of capitalism and the market economy
So we're stuck with either calling them confused "fake" socialists - or to acknowledge that the term socialist doesn't have the same meaning today as it did 50 years ago
I think the latter is more constructive in terms of understanding politics
The problem with this is, that talking about people who aren't socialists, as socialists, only further entrenches the capitalist system that socialists supposedly oppose
Hence why anti-capitalism is a necessity for socialist positions
Otherwise we end up in the exact situation that Fukuyama called 'the end of history'. A complete faltering of progress
A society where the choice is either status-quo or reaction
Progress dies, when we start to, in this way, manufacture consent for capitalism within the socialist movement
If we accept that 'the latter is more constructive in terms of understanding politics', we effectively concede the playing field
Capitalism must, by socialist, be opposed as the exploitative, alienating, and undemocratic economic system that it is
If socialists start to just be welfare-liberals+^^ ... Then the socialist struggle has definitively lost
> We do not need to call the politicians themselves socialist to acknowledge that the reforms were a victory for a socialist struggle
Not of a socialist struggle, but of a _class_ struggle
Hence why the label is misleading and shouldn't be applied
Socialism is the theory of class struggle
But struggles of the working class precede and prefigure the successive re-structurations _of capital
_ This axiom has held true all the way back to Marx
But the goal of socialism isn't the re-structurations of capital, but rather, is the abolition of the capital _relation_ in its entirety
The failures of the so-called 'great socialist experiments' of the 20th century, most of which befell either into totalitarianism, or collapsed into the capital relation again, were the reason for Fukuyama's vulgar thesis
but it only comes true if those of us who are socialists accept it
If we only take the lesson from the 20th century that 'socialism failed', with no nuance, and we then proceed to throw away struggle against the capital relation, struggle against class, struggle against capitalism
A better world _is_ possible
And the slogan of the worker's movement, labour union, parties, and of the autonomists should again be: "We want _everything_!"
I am by no means dismissing it
However, as I explained in another comment, rather than the result of socialist struggle, we should see it as the result of class struggle
I don't know if you recognise that, but it is your countrymen, people like Negri and Tronti, who put those ideas in my head
Socialism is only the theory of class struggle, it is not the class struggle itself
Marx is only the "greatest theorists of class struggle" (to borrow from a Bolshevik vocabulary), but he wasn't the "greatest class struggler", despite some people's attempts to paint him as such
The establishment of the welfare state is thus not the feat of socialists
rather, it is the state response to class struggle
This class struggle expressed both violently and with raised fists, in strikes, the most direct attack on capital (from the inside), but also class struggle as organised in the socialist party(/ies)
Don't worry about it
I'll just upvote you back
Same same, but different
Oh, most definetely
The narrative of social cohesion and cooperation and "we're all in this together" rhetoric and such, is perhaps some of the biggest BS one can encounter in politics

Do you drop by for 5 minutes checking "Top" every morning to check the threads, or do you sort through "New" to help answer as many questions you can every evening, doesn't matter
You're part of the community
As the community continues to grow, the moderation team wants to thank every member, both old and new, for being here, and making the community what it is
I've assigned you a Germany flair
Have a nice day
Nope
The only holidays we have in Denmark are the holidays of the National Church
Furthermore, holidays don't transfer, they stay on their canonical days, so sometimes you're lucky, sometimes you're not
I actually like that May 1st isn't a holiday; it means that it is a day of strike or walk-outs instead
which is a much more powerful message to send for unions and parties, IMO
Nowadays it's mostly a symbolic walk-out or symbolic strike-day, but still
It's not a holiday
We celebrate it; doesn't make it a holiday
National romanticism
Things like the fairytales of H.C. Anderson, the poems and songs of a lot of other romanticists
There's, luckily, also a lot of social realism though, and increasingly also contemporary social realism
So it's not all just a pink cloud of how beautiful and great Denmark is
Yea
One of the things I often encounter when I talk to people internationally about Denmark, is that I need to explain that while we have a low gini-coefficient, it's not like people start from 0
People are born into wealth, and a very small portion of people are born into a very large portion of wealth
So while their income may not be so as far from the Average Jens', we still have immense inequality in Denmark, and many are struggling to get by
I'm late AGAIN
But here are the (belated) answers of the 2020 community survey
Hey all
_I'm late again
But as they say: Better late than never
**And I've brought graphs for y'all
** ***Nice and round pie-charts
*** As y'all like them
Nice and easy to read
Graphs, graphs, graphs
First off: Thank you, to all who participated
It's always nice when these kinda projects go great, and find support in the community
We got almost 2800 responses, which is more than 200 responses more than last year
It's amazing to see this move forward
No, but on a serious note
I present to you: [The Results of the 2020, _Annus Horribilis_, /r/AskEurope Community Demographic Survey
A short overview is as follows:
* Oh my God, he actually didn't present nationality in a pie-chart this time
It's still not perfect though
Maybe 2021
Like last year, the Germans are the largest group on the subreddit, making up 11,8% of the community
That's a 2,1 percentage-point increase compared to last year
Like last year, the British take the second place, with 8,1%, then the Dutch with 7,2%, and then the US-Americans with 5,8%. Just shy of the podium there, but maybe 2021
* The general /r/AskEuropean is still a young, single, heterosexual male
The youngster groups make up 60,5% of the community (groups 15-18 and 19-24), they're mostly singles (69,9%) though that's a drop of 1,1 percentage-points compared to 2019, where we had 71% singles
Good to see y'all are getting out there
And we're still predominantly male, *though noticeably less so
* In 2019 the community was 77,8% males, this year, it's only 69,3%! That's a sharp move towards being more representative
* The share of students has fallen 3 percentage-points, from 57% to 54%.
* The share of heterosexual users has also fallen, 5 percentage-points, from roughly 75% to roughly 70%.
Now comes the political question, and it has gone kinda as you would expect from Reddit
Just shy of a quarter would describe themselves as socialists(24,6%) (which, as we know, are *the* best, and the mods on this subreddit are all a massive bunch of commies(or so we are told in the modmail)), combine this with those that answered for labour parties(7,4%), and the "Reds" make up a third of the community
Liberals on their own make up roughly a third as well, with the 'liberal' category being the largest of the whole bunch, at almost 28%, and right-wing libertarians(who're also liberals, lets be honest) make up 4,3%.
Greens make up 17,4% of the community, which is nice
You guys go protect the environment or smth
Then comes the ['Others'] who don't feel represented by the various other groupings
Just shy of 10% of the community identifies as various obscure ideologies: reactionaries, anarchists who didn't wanna press 'socialist', fascists, Posadists, monarchists
You know
those kinda guys
We've lumped them together
And then, smaller than even the ['Others'] come the conservatives and the christian democrats, who, together, make up 8,7% of the community
Once again, thank you all for participating
And as always, if you have any ideas for the survey, criticisms, questions you want added, or just wanna say hi, leave a comment down below, and we'll take it from there
Results from former surveys:
[2019 results]
[2018 results]
[2017 results]
[2016 results]
We discussed it internally in the modteam, and the discussion reached the point that social democrats can be grouped into two groups: welfare-liberals, and various forms of socialists, mainly reformists and utopian in nature
Thus those who think about their own ideas, would be able to choose either of those categories, while those who just identify with labour parties, irregardless of whether it has liberal or socialist leanings, could choose that option
Not at all, no
Danish is still very entrenched in Denmark, and is probably not going anywhere (at least not in my lifetime
Now, languages evolve and change, and take on new forms again, incorporate loan-words, expell archaic terms, grammar changes and so does pronunciation
It is inevitable
And if we try to artificially preserve language (like when we try to artificially preserve "history" in open-air museums) we can at most freeze it in place, and create a vulgar representation, a linguistic Frakenstein's monster
Ideologically charged and increasingly removed from our historical, cultural, scientific, etc
understanding of ourselves
Contemporary times
The past contains all sorts of nasty developments, and while contemporary society is ripe with problems such as internal contradictions, crisis, alienation and exploitation, I can hardly think of a period in the history of my country where it has been _better_ than it is now
Don't get me wrong, the "now" if far from great, it is far from good, but it's where I am, and where I intend to stay
The Moderators Want to Wish you all a Very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year
Dearest Community; both those of you with answers, and those of you with questions
Those of you who partake regularly, and those who silently just browse
Those of you who've been here for many years, and those who joined just now
The moderators wish to now once again wish all of you a very, very, merry Christmas and a happy New Year
Now comes the last call for the year 2019, this, our final year of this decade
And as the curtain falls, what is more appropriate, than to look back at the year that passed, here on our little corner of reddit
As always, I want to start off this "Christmas-card" by talking about how it is to be a moderator on the subreddit
And as always, I am going to say that it has been a great year
I am so extremely happy for the community to have developed the way it has
The camaraderie and fellowship it has, the openness to both the most ridiculous questions, and to more serious questions
It is an absolute joy to be a part of, and I am sure the other moderators feel the same way
While it was a rocky start, the subreddit finally got our new discord-server up and running back in Spring
We have a healthy, albeit small, but welcoming, part of the subreddit community hanging out on the server, sharing memes, discussing current events, and just talking about life, in great and small
You're all welcome to come join, [here's a link]
The community has grown quite a bit
And by quite a bit, I mean it has grown a lot
We've more than doubled our number of members, from just around 35 000 users, to almost 80 000 users
It is absolutely amazing to think about
If we continue to grow by this rate, we'll hit 100 000 in no time
Welcome to all of our new members, who've decided to join us this year
As we're rounding off this year, and readying ourselves for the future, I want to, on behalf of all the moderators, just once more wish you a very merry Christmas and a happy New Year
This year I want to share a Danish Christmas Carol
or kinda Danish
Because it's written by a Danish poet over the words of a German monk, set to the tune of a Silesian Christmas-song
[_Det kimer nu til julefest_]
I think after Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign there has been a general need to explain that Denmark, nor any other of the Nordic countries, are, by even the most revisionist or utopian definitions of the term, "socialist". Explaining how the extensive Nordic welfare model is spearheaded by liberals, conservatives, and socialists alike, is always fun
>!The Nordic model isn't particularly 'Social Democratic' for that matter either
Another thing is perhaps the relation between the size and how manoeuvrable the country is
I've often met tourists who come to either Copenhagen, Århus or Odense, and expect to use one of those cities as a "base of operations" in order to see the whole country(Barred Bornholm, because it's as remote as it is)
And while this definetely is _possible_, it's not advisable, simply because of how spread out the different sites are, and how hard it is to traverse the country using public transport
You'd often have to travel back on yourself in order to get from a to b. Renting a car makes it easier, but it's still hard
A third, and final one that sticks out, is explaining social cues
There's a stereotype about Nordic people generally being a-social
And while we often joke about it, it couldn't be farther from the truth
We don't hate engaging with each other, or with strangers, quite contrary
There's just a time and a place for it
> "they banned guns and freedom of speech, thus they were left"
The thing is, the Nazis actually encouraged male German citizens to own guns, and do shooting and hunting and such
I wouldn't necessarily call it 'dangerous', as the sentiment is already tied to the simplified and sometimes misleading political compass; only if the decision-making is made based on the compass, rather than on ideas and values, it becomes a problem
I think it's hard to find people who vote for the right-wing because it's the right-wing, and the left because it's the left
Recent election results all over Europe have shown that people are more than happy to jump from parties regarded as one place on the spectrum, to a party on a completely other side
Example: The exodus of social democratic votes to national conservative populist parties
[givment]
Excuse me, but what do you mean
In handwriting I write cursive, so I guess it's more like
_α_. But generally α is the most common form, nobody really learns to write a, not even in print
Ugly as hell, but that's just my [handwriting
Looks fine to me
No worries
O's are tied together with other letters at the top in Danish cursive
There are some o's around the page to show it
Hi /u/D_Redacted
To get a userflair, depending on whether or not you use old or new reddit, there are two options:
If you're using old reddit:
Go to the sidebar, and just below the community counters, there should be an option that says "Show my flair on this subreddit
It looks like:", or something similar
If you're using new reddit:
There is a drop-down menu below the "create new post" button
Opening it, you should see the option to add a user flair
Hope this helps
We've designed a completely new banner for the community – Isn't that enough
Since our Czech mod left, defenestrations have been off the table

ouch
Well
I believe that such a nationality, because that is what a 'European identity' would mean, with its own nationalism, etc
could be constructed, sure
The historian and pol
scientist Benedict Anderson argues in his 1983 book _Imagined Communities_ that nations "[are] imagined because the members of even the smallest nation will never know most of their fellow-members, meet them, or even hear of them, yet in the minds of each lives the image of their communion".
If a project of building a modern pan-European (national) identity succeeded, through media, administrative integration, cultural assimilation and integration, etc
etc
, I could easily see it arise as an part of the reproduction of modern liberal-capitalist Europe
Perhaps more out of necessity of the production, than of want of the people
Do I personally feel "European" at all
I hardly even feel Danish
I recognise that socially, I am Danish, but if I had the means to do so, I'd happily shed my layer of socialised nationalism, and instead live as an internationalist, to the bone
All I can do now, and actively do, is to work and act as an internationalist
I believe that _class_, rather than nations, should be the prime identification of people
We should recognise each other as peers (if we happen to be so), and recognise that we may not share interests with those of the other classes, even if we share 'nations'. As of right now, I feel I have more in common with another working class individual from Bologna or Bangkok, than with a director from Gentofte
It'd be weird _not_ to have a Danish flag, in Denmark
The Danish flag is used at all occasions
It's flown on all holidays, on all memorial days, at sporting events, at jubilees, on birthdays, weddings, baptisms, confirmations, on Christmas Eve, etc
It's used as decoration on Christmas trees, on birthday-cakes, on gift-wrappings, and a ton of more stuff
People who say American flag-use is excessive obviously have never been to Denmark
That said, we don't do many flag-pins like in the US
They're pretty common in super-market decorations
Especially when there's a sale going on(Which there always is)
Perhaps not in individual classrooms, but most schools have flags
Well
I'm not talking about the political use of the American flag
I'm talking about the private and commercial uses of our flags compared
The Danish flag is a crusader-banner which our kings just chose to use as their personal banner (with or without the consent of the Church), so it's a bunch of crosses
Like sure, the symbolism is more tied to Easter, but it's still somewhat Jesus-related
All holidays are public flag-days and the public masts are covered in flags
With memorial days I meant occupation 09/04, liberation 05/05, and "the day of the deployed" which is like septembre
Personally I despise our use of the flag, I find it too extreme
I'm an internationalist and I want to avoid using flags as much as possible
You're _all_ VIP's to us
Yea
I used to live in Stavtrup until recently, funnily enough
Luckily I've been able to move into the city centre now
I don't think it's fairly political
AFAIK it's common across the main political divide in the US
The Stars and Stripes seems to be one of the unifying things, and even when politicised, such as at protests, it's used by both the left and the right
Like, even the Socialist movement in the US actively uses the Star Spangled banner alongside their red flags
Because I disagree with the symbolism
As said, I'm an internationalist
I think where we disagree is on what the use of the flags mean
I don't buy that the Danish use of the flag should carry different meanings, rather, I believe it reproduces similar ideological lines as the American use
Internationalism: Unity across national boundaries and active opposition to any form of nationalism
Globalism: Global networks and interconnections particularly in trade and politics
It's literally the national symbol, and the symbol of the state
It reproduces and in its modern use finds root in the liberal concept of nationalism
"And active opposition to any form of nationalism"
As a symbol it still reproduces nationalism when used privately
Just like celebrating Christmas despite being the most ardent atheist oneself still reproduces religious aspects
That's... kinda the point with internationalism
That the people of the world should unite across nationalist boundaries to advance their common interests
Nations are an ideological construct as you said yourself, based on symbols and traditions
The real, material, division of people is the division based on economical class
I think you fundamentally misunderstand the concept
Underage drinking isn't a thing in Denmark, as we have no legal drinking age
It's 100% legal to drink as a 10-year old(although those serving the alcohol may or may not face legal repercussions depending on the context)
What there are restrictions on however, is the purchase of alcohol
Most people start drinking around age 15-16, and with the purchasing age of light alcoholic beverages being 16, it's roughly the same
Generally people are pretty light around it, and kids are often offered light beers as kids, and proper beers at the Confirmation(age 13), but very few actually start drinking regularly at those ages
Well
The case for Denmark at least is easy to make
At least if you're some sort of 'lefty' like me:
_Full disclaimer before you read my comment: I am an ardent socialist
I have been Union Rep
I am organised, even now, while studying, I am active in the labour movement
My comment will reflect this
It is not meant to be a neutral comment
* Even the poorest and the workers are heavily taxed, despite our 'progressive' tax system
In the last 20 or so odd years, liberal and social democratic governments alike, the tax-burden has been lightened for the richest, and spread to the broader population, dis-proportionally affecting those already weakest in society
* Cost of living is through the roof, with rents continuing to rise, effectively gentrifying the largerst cities, which is where there is acces to education and high-paying jobs, further dividing the centres and peripheries of the country
* The state has become increasingly centralised, thus, in continuation of above, the 'peripheral' municipalities are losing their opportunities to try and help themselves, and rely increasingly on the central government, removing the, once extensive, autonomy municipalities had
* The liberals have had great succes undermining trade-unions the last 20 years, which, because of the succes of so-called 'yellow' or 'ideologically alternative'(read 'liberal') trade-unions, have led to labour been overall weakened when it comes to collective bargaining
This means wages have stagnated, or fallen, for many workers, not to mention, Denmark is a country without much labour-legislation, so a lot of rights and securities have disappeared as well
* Education and academia has become increasingly watered out, with lack of funding
This has led to gymnasiums and universities in many cases turning into nothing but pipe-lines for certain jobs, and leave young people with ever more limited options
Trade-schools have it hard as well, as they also lack proper funding, and because of the insecurities tied to many of the trades, have a hard time attracting students
* Most government transfer-payments have been reduced to only the bare minimums, often not even enough to reproduce daily life
The liberal government abolished the national measure of poverty, _fattigdomsgrænsen_, in 2015, just two years after it was introduced, but _if_ it was still in place, we would have seen an increase of poverty in Denmark
* Integration of immigrants and refugees has, overall, not been a succes-story, and instead of building an integration-system that works, governments have, since the 1990'es, instead created ever harsher quotas and made it harder for people to integrate, pushing away the necessary immigrant labour for our domestic industries, allowing it to be replaced with often black-leg or unorganised foreign labour, which, in the former case doesn't pay taxes, or in the latter case, further undermine trade-unions and collective bargaining
Those are just the ones at the top of my head
I could think of more, if I wanted to
Oh yea
Most definitely
Don't get me started on how much I hate the way we put pineapple in our own juice as soon as anyone dares question anything about Denmark: "_But it's better than [somewhere else]_"
Also the politician thing
_God_, I wish we would have more fist-banging, high-yelling principled politicians who actually believed in their beliefs, instead of politicians posting about their morning runs or home baked bread on Instagram
Unlike /u/22dobbeltskudhul I see change as a possibility
Despite being a socialist, I refuse to see socialism as simply the negation of capitalism
Class conflict is a process, and as such it's also possible to reignite progressive change
One of the key parts in doing this is to strengthen the organisations of the working class: everything from sports-associations to trade-unions and political parties
Building a new one of the latter if necessary
It will also be necessary to rekindle class alliances and re-building the political hegemony on the left that working class interests enjoyed in the past; to reconcile the growing split between workers and intelligentsia, which has been spurred on by anti-intellectual rhetoric from the social democratic side in particular
It means to offer a new programme, focused on socialisation and practical socialism, redistribution, strengthening the 'Red' unions, and simply expanding and strengthening existing social policies ([such as including dental in the national health service] not to mention changing the tax-burden around, placing taxes on capital and other forms of 'dead wealth'(inheritance, land, etc
), creating better rights for renters, and simply offering an ideological alternative to various forms of liberalism
Depending on how we view the 'near' future, I'd say that this is very much possible
Also before I turn 50 (which is in 28 years time)
Will the necessary change come quicker and easier in Denmark than elsewhere
I don't know
I don't think Denmark, or the Nordic countries necessarily, have been a hotbed for progress
We haven't. It's a false impression
We're just as conservative as the rest of Europe, we just don't legislate based on it
But the 'tocsin of world revolution' (to use a 19th century expression) will always flow from somewhere, and this somewhere _can_ very well become Denmark
It's not really uncivilised as it is just old-fashioned
The traditions and rules of the British parliament, both chambers, are among the oldest traditions and rules of all parliamentary systems
Like, *in theory*, the House of Commons can only operate lawfully when the royal mace, dating from the reign of Charles II, is present at the table
But you're right
They are more rowdy than in other countries
Except perhaps Ukraine, where I know for a fact, there has been a least two fist-fights involving more than 3 MP's in the last 10 years
We do in Denmark as well
It's because we're taught, at least in Denmark, to walk on the left, so that oncoming traffic easier can see us, and have space to avoid us
This then translates onto sidewalks too, for some reason
I don't think so, no
Generally American politics and mainstream culture stands for everything that I am opposed to, besides there is a severe lack of jobs for people in my field, outside of teaching, which I by no means am interested in
Not to mention the politics: The US is far too liberal for me
The electorate system has resulted in two parties coming out on top: both of them Liberal, not to mention that in many parts of the country, on a state level, there's legislation which makes living in those areas as
my kind of person
difficult or unpleasant
And while the social situation is improving, and there's started to come some much needed non Liberal ideas in mainstream American politics, it's simply not good enough, and much of it is watered down by compromising with liberals on key issues
I strongly dislike Liberals, if that wasn't clear by now
And then comes the distance from friends and family: and while I'm sure that _if_ I ended up in the US, I'd be able to find new friends, and perhaps start a family of my own, it'd just be weird having to travel more than 15 hours just to visit my sister
Nope
I mean Liberal, as broad as that term is
Referring to social liberals, liberal conservatives, right-libertarians, classical liberals, etc
It is the liberal ideology I am opposed to, and all subsets of it(to varying degrees ofc
; we need to be a little nuanced as well)
Eeeeehhhh
that's an oversimplification and a half, isn't it
Like, Liberal is much broader than that, and I mean it in the broadest possible way
I'm also opposed to compromising with the Radical party here at home, as an example(It was even part of the reason I left the Social Democratic Party)
From what I hear and read, 'liberal' means exactly the same here as there
They just use it to refer to a broader party, and associate it with that, than necessarily the broad ideology, which, in this context, is the way I am using it
Ideological terms do not change meaning like that
I'm not opposed to comprising at all
I'm opposed to the direction that the recent(meaning post-Schlüter) compromises with the Liberals have dragged Denmark
There are plenty of compromises before that I agree with, and want to see more of
If the compromises made politically had been more pro-labour, I would have no problem with it; the problem is that it seems like we've reached a point where the Liberals are more than happy, or on some points even opposed to, the status-quo, resulting in them dragging "the opposite" way, a distinctly more liberal direction
And when the Social Democratic Party then chooses to sacrifice their pro-labour stance in return of the PM-position, then I get a problem with it
And I dont believe the point of a multi-party system is compromise
Compromise often is a result of multi-party systems, but it isn't, and shouldn't be, the rule
The goal of a liberal parliamentary system with proportionate representation is exactly that: proportionate representation
And if a compromise isn't possible, I dont believe we should attempt to force one
... You're not reading what I am writing
You're arguing only partly within the fields I am arguing within, hence we're talking around each other
I am saying that in the broadest meaning of the word 'liberalism' I am opposed to that certain ideological direction
Which, by the way, also includes Social Liberalism, and for that matter 'Liberal Socialism'.
When I write pro-labour, I'm not talking about welfare-policies or rights or anything like that, I am talking in sociological and ideoligical terms, as I have been from the beginning, and have been very clear about from the get-go
This means that when I talk about 'liberalism' in the context of politics, I am also in extension talking about the sociological concept of superstructure(as opposed to the economical base)
You're not addressing my points, as you're only accounting for half of my argument, hence the confusion, I believe
This means that when I am talking about being pro-labour, I am talking about the ideologies that are not the dominant ideology, not the superstructure, but rather are pro-labour in that they aim for a change in ideology from a liberal ideology to an ideology for the continuation of the emancipation of the labouring class
> How, in your view, is the labouring class not emancipated yet
In my view, emancipation of the labouring class, and the personal freedom that modern liberalism promotes go hand in hand
I am talking about economical emancipation, meaning freedom from economical exploitation
Within this sociological understanding of exploitation, it is part of the redistribution of labour, taking place during the process of separate groups exchanging their current productive labour for social labour set in goods received
The labour given towards production is embodied in the commodities or other wares and exploitation occurs when someone purchases a good, with their revenue or wages, for an amount unequal to the total labour he or she has put forth
This labour executed by a group over a given period of time is the same as the labour embodied to the goods that make up the Net National Product
The NNP is then divided out to the members of the group in some way and this is what creates the two groups involved in the exchange of goods: exploiters and exploited(Meaning the labouring-class)
The exploiters is the group able to command goods, with dividends from their wages, that are manifested with more labour than the exploiters themselves have performed, based on the exploitative social relations as described above
These groups often have an economical status, primarily ownership or other form of control of productive assets that aid the optimisation of the described exploitation
At the same time, the exploited group  is made up of those that receive less than the average product they produce
This means that if workers are paid an amount equivalent to their average product, there would be no revenue left and thus the workers cannot enjoy the fruits of their own labours meaning the difference between what is made and what that amount can purchase cannot be justified by redistribution according to their needs
> This is, I presume, the same way I am opposed to the ideological direction of Socialism
Not really
Again, this is tied to the concept of base and superstructure
Within this context 'liberalism' refers to the superstructure, to the in society dominant religious, legal, and political systems
And within our current economical status-quo, the current materialist conditions, aka the economical base(Hence why we talk about base and superstructure), we see that the liberal ideology prevails(in various forms, that is granted, noone in their right mind would argue that the form it takes in Germany is the same as the form it takes in Peru, yet both are, in the broad sense of the word, liberal)
The exploiting group from above determine the superstructure of society and the nature of the justifying ideology, meaning the  actions feasible because the exploiting class control the productive assets of our society
This means that as a part of maintaining the social status-quo, it is important the ideology; it politically confuses the exploited groups of society via what sociologists call false consciousness
> [...] the key to a successful democracy is one, where everybody's opinion matters, and thus compromises is at the core of the process and an extremely important part of how the country is run
Perhaps, but I don't think you believe this should mean we should all compromise on our views at all times, do you
There is the ongoing border-conflict fought with booze and flags, that Denmark is waging on behalf of Greenland, with Canada, over the uninhabited isle of Tartupaluk
It's more of a fun gimmick, I guess, than any real official relation, but the border is disputed
I'd say that despite not being "in the middle" of anything, most people would consider western Jutland, perhaps more specifically northern western Jutland, to be in "the middle of nowhere". There are no major towns or cities around, and not really any major cultural, historical, or economical sites either
The largest towns being Struer and Holstebro, and the prime industry fishing and agriculture
_Edit:_ Another contender for the price could be Lolland-Falster, two islands south of Zealand, famed for their lack of economical growth, bad infrastructure, high unemployment, etc
That said, it's pretty close to Copenhagen still, and isn't really a traditional border-region like Jutland, nor traditionally presented as an "other", unlike Jutes, who've often been presented as a special subset of Danes(considering we used to be a separate people, it's only fair)
_Edit II:_ [Here's a map with the areas circled] Because of the tourism industry, Bornholm isn't really seen as being "the middle of nowhere", despite being isolated from the rest of the country
Neither really
like, I'm grouped into Danes because of how I am socialised, but I am not actively identifying as a Dane
In continuation of this, identifying with region/city levels isn't really a thing that much in Denmark
I identify the most with class
as it is at least materially identifiable
Yes
I think that tradition, and particularly big holidays and rituals of passing, are great for understanding how deeply religiosity is rooted in culture
Death however is special
As others have said, it's also a way for many of coping
And having been submerged in a christian-religious culture for their entire life, choosing christian-religious coping methods (or vulgar-Christianity in terms of the recently passed going directly to heaven), comes the most natural for most
So while people may not be "actively" religious, or believers or whatever, religiosity still is so deeply ingrained in the cultural fabric of societies, and really show that secularism hasn't penetrated into culture (yet)
Housing is often of poor or sub-par quality, some areas are very densely build up, a lot of infrastructure is lacking or very old (not necessarily roads, I'm of the belief cities should be build for pedestrians and bikes), housing can be very expensive to have upkeep of, etc
etc
Nope
Nowadays, most Danish dialects are sufficiently subtle, that most people can understand most other
The generations where dialects were incomprehensible, and learning "Danish of the Realm" was a necessity for, let's say, Southern Jutes, or people from Bornholm, are reaching at least pensioner's age, and even then, it's very likely that those from that generation don't speak with a pronounced dialect
It also helps that most Danish dialects aren't that hard to understand in the first place, with a few outliers
We don't have dialects that are outright incomprehensible to outsiders (except maybe Southern Jute
) Most of the time, it's more a question of rhythm and where the stress of particular words is placed, than vocabulary or the speed of talking
So do I, but they don't speak it to an incomprehensible degree, nor are have I ever experienced them being asked to "speak clearly" when in company of others
Just listen to a lot of Niels Hausgaard, you'll pick it up eventually ;)
But yea, usually those with the _thicc'est_ dialects switch 'naturally', or how to put it, I completely agree
Yea, you're right
It's vendelbomål... Well, it can't hurt to try
One of the reasons I haven't moved to Cph yet, I just know that despite my dialect being so minor (Djursbomål), people are still going to pick it up
I've never thought of the dialects from any of those regions as aggressive, and the "unintelligent" thing is some elitist bullcrap
Like, have the Copenhageners even heard their own dialect
They speak super slow
and like, being slow typically is a "nice" way to say something else
I guess the worst I've experienced is that people don't understand when I say things like 'kimse' or 'møjet' and stuff like that
But again, people think it's more "cute" than anything
Yea, it's a way of framing people from places like Randers or Hjørring as particularly "backwards". IMO, it's disgusting
When I used to engage in youth politics (Thank _fuck_ I don't do that anymore) it was extremely prevalent
People from "provincial" areas would take on almost mocking dialects (think Fritz and Poul from _Rytteriet_) in order to not be called out as "less".
It's also a way, I feel, that many Copenhagener progressives "write off" having to deal with people outside of Copenhagen, because they are 'just backward' and need leadership or some bs
Those who understand all dialects, and those who only understand their own
Also: What beer is best
Kinda like Austria most areas used to have their own beers, this was the case in Denmark as well, so now some areas are very entrenched in our choice of beer
#TeamCeres
Because why not
It's just as good an example as any else
Not at all
I am just fond of Austria
I like *being* in Austria and especially Vienna very much
I wouldn't move there, but I love visiting
Well
You can always find a place that serves either Gösser or Stiegl
A national passport
There is no doubt that an EU passport would be weaker than the Danish passport
Wouldn't it be _L'Internationale_ though
Like, _Ode to Joy_ is more just pan-European, while the other is
well
Internationalist
Can you name other internationalist movements than the Socialist movement though
But it has been adopted by the Pan-European movement(s) and the EU, leading it to simply rather have connotations of some modern continuation of liberal nationalism a la the 18th and 9th centuries, rather than carrying an actual internationalist meaning
Yea, but not internationalist
Most ideological movements are international, so I don't see the irony
Primarily the political ones like "overrun with muslims", "swedistan, amiright", "you can't even own a butterknife", etc
This ofc
also applies to things like when talking about welfare-policies in a positive light, as they often just as misinformed
There's no way of knowing exactly
The first domestic claim to "all of Denmark (and Norway)", is the Greater Jellinge Rune-stone, which is from the late 10th century, probably around 950-970
But we do have mentions of a "Denmark" from before that, in peace-treaties, geographical and historical works, etc
Passing the 1863 constitution
It was an obvious attempt at directly integrating the duchy of Slesvig into Denmark, breaking multiple international treaties and ending in a war
Never
Which is understandable, there would be very little weight behind such a claim
This is a question that requires
Some elaboration
First off: How do we understand the term 'socialism'? Do we understand it in a Leninist way, as a transitionary phase between capitalism and communism
Do we understand it in a Marxist fashion as a socialist mode of production, meaning a post-capitalist society
Do we understand it in an Utopian way, as a lesser defined "free and equal society"? Or how do we understand it
The way that it seems that Norberg understands it, is in a way that is associated with the command economies of the old soviet system, which, it is true, Sweden experimented with in the timespan from around the 1940'es until the 1970'es
So since the late 1970'es, the Swedish economy, the Swedish economy has been just as market oriented as most other western European states, and, since the fall of the so-called Eastern Bloc, also the 'Eastern'-European states
So if it _isn't_ socialism, and it isn't democratic socialism
What is it then
Well
**It is capitalist**. Sweden is, as all other states on Earth, a capitalist state
Capitalism here meaning 'a society dominated by the relations of capital'. Sweden has an economy based on private property, wage labour, commodity market exchange, etc
and has had, since capitalism arose from feudal relations
Where does the whole debacle of socialism then enter
It enters as either a deliberate rhetorical trick, or as a historical misunderstanding, or, perhaps as it often is, a little bit of both
Politicians like Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, and their supporters, frame socialism (in a vulgar way) here as _merely_ the progress of class struggle, such as in the fight for unionisation, higher wages, lower hours, etc
They frame socialism as _merely_ the establishment of welfare policies for the working class
And they use this framing to
well
I actually don't really know why they do it
I must make one point very clear here: Socialism is _not_ the mere progression of the class struggle
By that logic, we should label the liberals in the British parliament in the 19th century who passed [the various factory acts] as 'socialists'... Which makes no sense
What Sweden does have, is what sociologist Gøsta Esping-Andersen calls a 'Universal Welfare Model'. A universalistic welfare system that promotes an equality of high standards, rather than an equality of minimal needs
This implies decommodifying welfare services, to reduce the division introduced by market-based access to welfare services, as well as preemptively socialising the costs of caring for children, the aged, and the helpless, instead of then waiting until the family's capacity to support them is depleted
That's it
It's simply a welfare model, enacted in capitalist production, to help
negate, I guess, some of the more obvious problems of capitalism (but failing to attack and solve the real problems of capitalism as well)
Thank you for your comment
And thanks for the background of Norberg; I thought he was generally well-known, so I didn't include it
You're right my periodisation may be off by a margin, though with the
comparably large amount of control that the Swedish government had over Swedish industry _into_ the 1970'es, it's not a stretch to apply like I did
but you're absolutely right, that it can be discussed
> Many people who call themselves "socialist" today are not suggesting the complete abolishing of capitalism and the market economy
So we're stuck with either calling them confused "fake" socialists - or to acknowledge that the term socialist doesn't have the same meaning today as it did 50 years ago
I think the latter is more constructive in terms of understanding politics
The problem with this is, that talking about people who aren't socialists, as socialists, only further entrenches the capitalist system that socialists supposedly oppose
Hence why anti-capitalism is a necessity for socialist positions
Otherwise we end up in the exact situation that Fukuyama called 'the end of history'. A complete faltering of progress
A society where the choice is either status-quo or reaction
Progress dies, when we start to, in this way, manufacture consent for capitalism within the socialist movement
If we accept that 'the latter is more constructive in terms of understanding politics', we effectively concede the playing field
Capitalism must, by socialist, be opposed as the exploitative, alienating, and undemocratic economic system that it is
If socialists start to just be welfare-liberals+^^ ... Then the socialist struggle has definitively lost
> We do not need to call the politicians themselves socialist to acknowledge that the reforms were a victory for a socialist struggle
Not of a socialist struggle, but of a _class_ struggle
Hence why the label is misleading and shouldn't be applied
Socialism is the theory of class struggle
But struggles of the working class precede and prefigure the successive re-structurations _of capital
_ This axiom has held true all the way back to Marx
But the goal of socialism isn't the re-structurations of capital, but rather, is the abolition of the capital _relation_ in its entirety
The failures of the so-called 'great socialist experiments' of the 20th century, most of which befell either into totalitarianism, or collapsed into the capital relation again, were the reason for Fukuyama's vulgar thesis
but it only comes true if those of us who are socialists accept it
If we only take the lesson from the 20th century that 'socialism failed', with no nuance, and we then proceed to throw away struggle against the capital relation, struggle against class, struggle against capitalism
A better world _is_ possible
And the slogan of the worker's movement, labour union, parties, and of the autonomists should again be: "We want _everything_!"
I am by no means dismissing it
However, as I explained in another comment, rather than the result of socialist struggle, we should see it as the result of class struggle
I don't know if you recognise that, but it is your countrymen, people like Negri and Tronti, who put those ideas in my head
Socialism is only the theory of class struggle, it is not the class struggle itself
Marx is only the "greatest theorists of class struggle" (to borrow from a Bolshevik vocabulary), but he wasn't the "greatest class struggler", despite some people's attempts to paint him as such
The establishment of the welfare state is thus not the feat of socialists
rather, it is the state response to class struggle
This class struggle expressed both violently and with raised fists, in strikes, the most direct attack on capital (from the inside), but also class struggle as organised in the socialist party(/ies)
Don't worry about it
I'll just upvote you back
Same same, but different
Oh, most definetely
The narrative of social cohesion and cooperation and "we're all in this together" rhetoric and such, is perhaps some of the biggest BS one can encounter in politics

I've assigned you a Germany flair
Have a nice day
Nope
The only holidays we have in Denmark are the holidays of the National Church
Furthermore, holidays don't transfer, they stay on their canonical days, so sometimes you're lucky, sometimes you're not
I actually like that May 1st isn't a holiday; it means that it is a day of strike or walk-outs instead
which is a much more powerful message to send for unions and parties, IMO
Nowadays it's mostly a symbolic walk-out or symbolic strike-day, but still
It's not a holiday
We celebrate it; doesn't make it a holiday
National romanticism
Things like the fairytales of H.C. Anderson, the poems and songs of a lot of other romanticists
There's, luckily, also a lot of social realism though, and increasingly also contemporary social realism
So it's not all just a pink cloud of how beautiful and great Denmark is
Yea
One of the things I often encounter when I talk to people internationally about Denmark, is that I need to explain that while we have a low gini-coefficient, it's not like people start from 0
People are born into wealth, and a very small portion of people are born into a very large portion of wealth
So while their income may not be so as far from the Average Jens', we still have immense inequality in Denmark, and many are struggling to get by
I'm late AGAIN
But here are the (belated) answers of the 2020 community survey
Hey all
_I'm late again
But as they say: Better late than never
**And I've brought graphs for y'all
** ***Nice and round pie-charts
*** As y'all like them
Nice and easy to read
Graphs, graphs, graphs
First off: Thank you, to all who participated
It's always nice when these kinda projects go great, and find support in the community
We got almost 2800 responses, which is more than 200 responses more than last year
It's amazing to see this move forward
No, but on a serious note
I present to you: [The Results of the 2020, _Annus Horribilis_, /r/AskEurope Community Demographic Survey
A short overview is as follows:
* Oh my God, he actually didn't present nationality in a pie-chart this time
It's still not perfect though
Maybe 2021
Like last year, the Germans are the largest group on the subreddit, making up 11,8% of the community
That's a 2,1 percentage-point increase compared to last year
Like last year, the British take the second place, with 8,1%, then the Dutch with 7,2%, and then the US-Americans with 5,8%. Just shy of the podium there, but maybe 2021
* The general /r/AskEuropean is still a young, single, heterosexual male
The youngster groups make up 60,5% of the community (groups 15-18 and 19-24), they're mostly singles (69,9%) though that's a drop of 1,1 percentage-points compared to 2019, where we had 71% singles
Good to see y'all are getting out there
And we're still predominantly male, *though noticeably less so
* In 2019 the community was 77,8% males, this year, it's only 69,3%! That's a sharp move towards being more representative
* The share of students has fallen 3 percentage-points, from 57% to 54%.
* The share of heterosexual users has also fallen, 5 percentage-points, from roughly 75% to roughly 70%.
Now comes the political question, and it has gone kinda as you would expect from Reddit
Just shy of a quarter would describe themselves as socialists(24,6%) (which, as we know, are *the* best, and the mods on this subreddit are all a massive bunch of commies(or so we are told in the modmail)), combine this with those that answered for labour parties(7,4%), and the "Reds" make up a third of the community
Liberals on their own make up roughly a third as well, with the 'liberal' category being the largest of the whole bunch, at almost 28%, and right-wing libertarians(who're also liberals, lets be honest) make up 4,3%.
Greens make up 17,4% of the community, which is nice
You guys go protect the environment or smth
Then comes the ['Others'] who don't feel represented by the various other groupings
Just shy of 10% of the community identifies as various obscure ideologies: reactionaries, anarchists who didn't wanna press 'socialist', fascists, Posadists, monarchists
You know
those kinda guys
We've lumped them together
And then, smaller than even the ['Others'] come the conservatives and the christian democrats, who, together, make up 8,7% of the community
Once again, thank you all for participating
And as always, if you have any ideas for the survey, criticisms, questions you want added, or just wanna say hi, leave a comment down below, and we'll take it from there
Results from former surveys:
[2019 results]
[2018 results]
[2017 results]
[2016 results]
We discussed it internally in the modteam, and the discussion reached the point that social democrats can be grouped into two groups: welfare-liberals, and various forms of socialists, mainly reformists and utopian in nature
Thus those who think about their own ideas, would be able to choose either of those categories, while those who just identify with labour parties, irregardless of whether it has liberal or socialist leanings, could choose that option
Not at all, no
Danish is still very entrenched in Denmark, and is probably not going anywhere (at least not in my lifetime
Now, languages evolve and change, and take on new forms again, incorporate loan-words, expell archaic terms, grammar changes and so does pronunciation
It is inevitable
And if we try to artificially preserve language (like when we try to artificially preserve "history" in open-air museums) we can at most freeze it in place, and create a vulgar representation, a linguistic Frakenstein's monster
Ideologically charged and increasingly removed from our historical, cultural, scientific, etc
understanding of ourselves
Contemporary times
The past contains all sorts of nasty developments, and while contemporary society is ripe with problems such as internal contradictions, crisis, alienation and exploitation, I can hardly think of a period in the history of my country where it has been _better_ than it is now
Don't get me wrong, the "now" if far from great, it is far from good, but it's where I am, and where I intend to stay
