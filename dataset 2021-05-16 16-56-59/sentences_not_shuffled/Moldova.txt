Wait what
How can a 13 year old be the LEADER of a Neo-Nazi group
And why specifically the Las Vegas Synagogue
This reads like a The Onion article
Cazimir, Ferdinand, Manole, Toader (lol) for males
Ileana, Lidia, Eudochia, Elvira, Domnica for females
Male names: Scorilo, Lefter, Tiberiu, Ciprian, Dromihete, Davos, Manole, Gavril
Female names: Paraschiva, Margareta, Magdalena, Letiția
Those all sound quite nice, it’s just that when I hear them I think of old people and medieval personalities
I know many people named Ilie and like one Otilia who are young
I know like 5 people named Geta lol
Pavel and Ioan too, I’d say
Yeah it's a very old name but it is still widely used, like Dacian for example
It's the least visited country in Europe
only 121,000 foreigners are reported to have entered the country in 2016 (so says the UN World Tourism Organisation), making it the least visited in Europe
It went nearly 3 years without a  president
In 2012, after nearly three years of political deadlock, Moldova elected the veteran judge, Nicolae Timofti, as president – for the first time in 917 days, the country had a leader
It keeps a fine cellar
The venerable folk at Guinness World Records recognise the Mileștii Mici wine cellar in Moldova is the world’s largest with nearly two million bottles of plonk in its darkened vaults,  the most valuable tipples in its collection sell for a reported €480 each
Moldova has a faster internet connection than Norway, America, and 150 other countries
Out of 152 countries included in the ranking of Internet access speed, Moldova is on the 3rd place
Cleopatra Stratan holds the record for the highest paid young artist, the youngest artist to receive an MTV award and the youngest artist to score a #1 hit in a country
She was only 3 yo when started to sing with her dad at concerts and released her first song
Glad to know it , if you're interested i can suggest some places to visit  , welcome :)
oh yeah
Even if I myself am from Moldova, I do not consider the autonomy of Transnistria worthy of recognition
i'd say yes
Transnistria it's a fake country
It's a puppet state made by Russia
Transnistria is not perceived as a self-sufficient state even if it has a president, own money and passport
It is  still largely dependent on support from Russia, which is the main reason why society does not have a chance to develop and why the region is still not an independent political player
The question should be: "Do you ever forget that Moldova is just sitting there
In romanian children’s books bears say “mor mor” which is pretty similar to the finnish “murmur”, lol
Well we don’t have that here even though we were part of the USSR , it’s the first time I ever hear about this
Same thing
Also, one of the singers is Romanian
Pretty much any eastern european capital city in 1990, when there was a lot of chaos and crime
Kiev, Moscow, Bucharest, Sofia, Warsaw would be  good choices IMO
Maybe you’d get to play a criminal who has to do something before the chaos settles down and order is restored
Really
Good luck dude, seriously
You have my support
I understood everything from the middle English and Scots texts and I got the general idea of what was being said in the early modern English text, I don't understand anything when it comes to the other 2 texts
Well, we have this one:
Soare**le** - The Sun (masculine)
Lun**a** - The Moon (feminine)
Pământ**ul** - The Earth (masculine when singular, feminine when plural, i. e. it's neuter)
Vlad Plahotniuc
I think every country from Europe knows him
:) Or at least from my country
It depends, if your native language is English, I would say that it's practically impossible, Italians would probably have an easier time though
I've leared french at school for three years
I hardly understood it
I've forgot almost everything in the past two years and I don't understand it at all
Looking at you, vietnam
He’s just standing there
menacingly
Depends on who you ask
Trust me, you wouldn’t want to know
Ourselves, Ukraine and Russia for obvious reasons
Do French people do that
I'm curious since I thought that people from Northern European countries weren't as close to their extended family as someone from like Italy, Spain or Romania
Part of a country that voted for uniting with Romania, whose majority is Romanian and was oppressed for hundreds of years by their conquerors
Sorry, I was joking :) we don’t have a true rival except transnistria, but that’s an internal conflict
it was a joke, sorry if you took it seriously
It’s because we don’t really have a rival nation - except the separatist transnistria, but that’s considered civil war/internal conflict
Those "mild" policies caused the ethnic makeup of Transylvania to go from 62% Romanians and 23% Hungarians to 51% Romanians and 31% Hungarians, also because nationalities weren't recognised only the mother tongue of a person was, and even earlier when Hungary was a Kingdom the conquered Romanian nobles were magyarized and converted to Catholicism
Romanians had no rights and the Hungarian government only wanted to give Romanians autonomy in the 1st World War because Romanian troops started advancing into Transylvania, otherwise they would've proceeded with their magyarization of the land
Also mind you the saxons also suffered from the magyarization and weren't on friendly terms with the Hungarians, they supported the union on the 8th of January after negotiations with Romanian politicians to ensure that their cultural rights would be protected under the Romanian state, since they weren't under the Hungarians
Yeah, they claim to be some kind of a “last remnant” of it, but they’re actually more capitalist than us (since there’s a big monopoly there that owns almost everything, called Sherrif) and it’s mostly just for show
Yeah rebelled with help from Daddy Russia who now has "peace-keeper" troops over there, transnistria can go to hell, it was never Romanian, the only thing that bothers me are the territories they control that are passed the river border
Curvă in Romanian means whore
Curva in Italian means curve
Yeah, I find myself laughing everytime I hear "curva" in Italian
BONUS:
Fiică - daughter (ro)
Fica - pussy (ita)
Actually стул is chair and стол is table :D
Even drier than it already is
I feel like I'm melting everyday
It was extremely popular, my grandpa still has 2 ladas
Not odd at all
And not uncommon either, some people have a small flag in their car or in their home
And when you go to a protest or national holiday or something in the city you take it with you
Weird, flags are usually attached to poles
That's insane
Traditional music, when I was a child I considered it super boring and unpleasant (I listened to american music a lot and I considered our traditional music outdated and primitive)
I thought only old people and rural villagers could listen to that
But now, I can appreciate a good folk song or new music that adapts those songs into a kind of folk-rap-dubsteb mix
Subcarpați for example, they manage to make folk music sound way cooler and it sounds up to date
Via Dacă is good too
It seems more and more young people enjoy it
Yes, me too
Am înțeles aproape tot, dar asta e deoarece vorbesc româna, italiana și învăț și spaniola lol, oricum nu cred că ceilalți vorbitori de limbi neo-latine vor înțelege mare lucru din ceea ce-am scris
And Romanians can practically understand most of italian and Spanish but no one understands them, even though Romanian is technically the 4th closest language to latin lol
Am înțeles cam 70% din ceea ce-ai zis lol, chiar dacă circa 30% din cuvintele românești provin din franceză, limba asta e cea mai grea de descifrat pentru mine
Cuvintele franceze tot din latină sunt lol, așa că procentajul e de circa 80% nu 30%
Româna are multe cuvinte care chiar dacă provin din latină nu sunt prezente în vocabularul celorlalte limbi neo-latine sau au avut o evoluție diferită, de aceea și pare mai grea de înțeles pentru vorbitorii de portugheză, italiană, spaniolă etc
Limba cea mai aproape limbii române (excluzând aromâna) este italiana, cu care limba română are circa 78% de cuvinte derivate de la o rădăcină comună, extrem de puțin dacă compari de exemplu franceza cu italiana (89% de cuvinte care au aceeași rădăcină)
Nu aș zice, română e a patra cea mai aproape limbă de latină, după spaniolă, faptul că românii au fost izolați de celelate limbi romanice de-alungul timpului a făcut ca limba noastră să evolueze pe căi diferite, faptul că vorbitorii altor limbi neo-latine nu ne-ar înțelege, nu e necesar vina influențelor slave, pentru că noi pe voi vă înțelegem destul de bine
Voce înseamnă voce și în română lol
Ce-ai citit tu e adevărat, italienii folosesc multe cuvinte care există și în română dar sunt utilizate mai rar sau au o altă semnificație, de exemplu:
Portare - in italiană înseamnă "a aduce"
Purta - are aceeași rădăcină cu italienescul "portare" dar are un înțeles diferit, corespunde plus minus cu "indossare" în italiană
It would look like ours then
Gion meid his uăi tu ei tăvern  tru dă darc forest, onli tu faind aut dat hi forgot dă mani
In Romanian: Ion a ajuns la cârciumă prin întunecata pădure, doar pentru a-și da seama ca și-a uitat banii
They meant how it would be written so that you would read it like in english xD “Gion meid his uei tu ă tavărn tru dă darc forest, onli tu faind aut dat hi forgot dă moni” something like that
He/She’s asking for the phonetic script, so “John is walking through the forest” would be something like “Gion iz ualching tru dă forăst”
A billion MDL got stolen (by someone in the parliament, iirc), took months to trace back
Idk if this is anything big compared to other countries
Vaca Domnului - Firebug, it literally translates to "The Lord's cow"
Broască-țestoasă - Tortoise, or "hard-shelled frog"
Same thing here, one thing I'd like to add ia that people from the country also don't like city-folk, thinking they're lazy, sophisticated, etc
It's not uncommon to hear (at least over here) that: "Toți orășenii sunt trântori" lol
You're talking about the Republic of Moldova
Cause I've never heard "pilitură de osânză" in my entire life, and I live there
it's not Russian but Old Church Slavonic, a Southern Slavic language closely related to Bulgarian
Old Church Slavonic was the main lithurgical language for Orthodox Church)
Sure, not everywhere but it is still being used
Lol what
You want to tell me that you don't change classes every period
I remember when I went to school in Moldova that when we changed classes some teachers wouldn't let us in till the bell rung so we had to stay outside the class and wait for 15 minutes (break time), some would go outside or to the buffet (bar)
We have students that carry the register from classroom to classroom (the class president, "șeful clasei")
No, we were all divided into different classes (ex: a X-a "B") , every class had its schedule, so during break time (we had 15 minute breaks between every period) the halls were filled with students going to their specific classroom
People would leave their stuff in classroom and then they could just stay in classroom and wait till the bell rung or go to the buffet, go outside etc
Although, as I said, some teachers would tell us to wait outside the classroom till the bell rung, which was quite annoying
High School and Middle School too
Wait
You want to tell me that you don't use the latin derived terms for the days of the week
Whaaa
Mare mare
Lol
Romanian has 4 lol
Romania: their fight against corruption
They don’t just give up and say “that’s just how it is” (this is a huge problem in Moldova) when referring to the current situation
This might just be what will save them from poverty in the future - the fact that they expect more from their country and they actually make an effort for it
Romania is on the right path and has a lot of potential, and I hope we follow their tracks
Ukraine: it takes some massive balls to stand up to the russian government, russia being right next to you, having annexed Crimea and helped rebels in donbas
I hope more of us can stand up to them as well, the russian people deserve a better leadership
I hope Ukraine will continue on the right path, they have potential
Transnistria: I like the city Tighina
Can we borrow it
^jk
^except ^if
^Nah ^just ^kidding
^^unless
By loyal, do you mean "Russian puppet" by any chance
Georgia is on there, I guess he didn't mean that then
a = to , as in “to walk” would be “a merge”.
e = is, as in “he is tall” would be “el e înalt”.
o = oh (interjection) as in “oh, that’s cool” OR o = a , as in “a woman is dancing” would be “o femeie danseaza” (only for female words)
It's definitely perceived as rude to ask about someone's wage, unless it's between family and close friends
Most people in Europe are at least bilingual though
Might explain why some have differently sized ears
Academia Română
Ungheni (Moldova) and Ungheni (Romania), although it’s not exactly halved, most of the city is on our part of the river Prut (which separates it in two parts) and a bit of it is in Romania
always
I even pack home clothes when I travel, to use them when staying inside
they're a necessity
comfy yet you don't care how u look in them:)
i love playing playing poland in civilization V, because its abilities are so overpowered :D
I think that has to be an Israeli one
Another one was from Oman, I think (not sure about it)
Given that that was in Moldova, that's quite exotic
There are some US ones, but that's not that surprising cause a lot of people here import cars (mostly hybrid) from America
not a custom but I still do it and get weird looks
some of them are quite nice though and it seems that the 'thank you' kinda makes their day less annoying
Romania looks like a fish and Moldova like a grape lol
I certainly agree with your opinion
>Really our connection with the Bulgarians is underrated, our history is intertwined at so many points in time and it's a shame that our time in the Bulgarian Empires is so criminally unmentioned in our schools
Can I ask you why are you such a bulghar fanboy
>The Bulghars were our main source of slavificstion and we also got along with them pretty well
You think slavification is a good thing
Lol, it wasn't even slavification since we still speak a latin language, and Bulgarian loan words make up only 2% of romanian words (for reference 22% of our vocabulary is comprised of french words)
Musaca - greek, ghiveci - turkish, sarmale - turkish, maybe the turks are our brothers, lmao
>Saying slavification didn't happen becaude we still speak a Romance language is like saying I didn't paint a wall because only a bit is actually with paint on, Slavs still had a major impact on Romanian
Slavification would mean getting entirely replaced by slavs
>This is only talking about modern Romanian, which is after the big attempt to latinise our language after the 19th century when many slavic words were replaced
Frenchify*, in fact a lot of archaic words originating from latin got replaced during that time
>Previous to that an even bigger amount of slavic words were used, and Romanian was commonly regarded at that time as a Slavic language
It wasn't? And if it were it's because of people being ignorant, literally an italian scholar went to the Romanian states in the 15th or 16th century, saying that people there speak a romance langauge, and also, as I said previously, there were also a lot of archaic latin derived words that were used, if you read old texts (16th century)  you'd see that the overwhelming majority of words there are of latin origin
>Throwing out the fact that a food originates from one place and not from another doesn't really mean anything as to in what culture it can be traditional in
It does, it means that these cultures interacted a lot and weren't as hated as you may think, lol
>Idk why you oppose the fact that we and the Bulgarians do have stuff in common, genuinely curious about that
I don't, I'm generally curious why you're sucking their dick so hard, unless you perceive being "slavified" and having a cyrillic alphabet as something uniting
Transnistria
Rusia sponsored a civil war beacouse they wanted communism and they  won but the land is so tiny nobody but Rusia says its its own state
But that have their own currency gouverment and an army that exedes ours
ok but what about Găgăuzia lol
I literally don't know anything about what's going on there
Beacouse that place is not so radical unlike Transnistria
yea but what's happening there lol
also, it's spelled 'because', pal
Its just self-administred
ish
Make it so the Turks won the war against Russia in 1813
Edit: Actually, now that I think about it, I would make it so Michael the Brave wouldn't be betrayed and killed, because that would have united all Romanians under one banner 300 earlier
Wine, every single person in the countryside has a wine cellar and they've probably produced wine before
Negatively, because those builders are treated like garbage and many actually died
FIFA shouldn't have enabled this
It will be partially boycotted anyway
Watching the World Cup in winter won't feel the same
It's called Ketchunnaise, and it's super popular in the ex-soviet countries as far as I know
It's a poor man's sauce, and we embrace the fact
It's like drinking cheap alcohol: you know it's the worst option you can take, but also the only one most of the time
Russians also call it ketchunnaise
our memes are pretty funny since they usually mix up Russian with Romanian so basically no one really understands them except for us lol
Also, "Jassy" (Iași), which both looks and sounds horrible
I think that most of us think of Romania as a mix between Dacian and Roman culture (which isn't that true)
Too bad we don't really know anything about the Dacians
We only have one and it's a part of a bigger Cultural Site, the Struve Geodetic Arc
Is it weird for you that we call it “Portugalia” here
So do you guys call welsh people “little brits”? :)
As far as I know, there’s no word in english that has that sound to give as an example, but you could write România” in google translate romanian language, and press the speaker so you can know what it sounds like
Sasha is a form of both Aleksandr (masculine) and Aleskandra (feminine)
I don't really know, I just know that Sasha is either Aleksandr or Aleksandra
Probably ks turns into sh as it is in Aleksei - Alyosha
BTW there is also another diminutive form of Aleksandr - Shurik (SHOO-reek), Shura for women
The opposite happened to me when I moved to Italy, at first I used to speak in English with people around me and we couldn't really understand each other since their knowledge of the language was quite basic (my Italian was at a very basic level too and i was feeling kind of embarrassed when speaking it) , but when I started speaking Italian to them after half a month or so of studying the language they started only speaking Italian with me and never switched again, which i am very thankful for
Transnistria, it’s basically de facto independent (own currency, passports, border controls) and I wish we would just
let it go away at this point
Problem is, the whole “hostility” between Moldova and Transnistria is just a show
Moldova’s government is just as traitorous as the separatists are, to the people of the country
If I remember correctly, [A high ranking transnistrian separatist official arrived at the Chisinau airport after a vacation in Egypt with his family
with police bodyguards surrounding him, he was allowed to skip the wait for the passport control
Journalists recorded it all
Our state’s leadership literally doesn’t give a fuck anymore and it’s sad
(link is not in english, sorry)]  also, Transnistria’s whole “last bastion of communism” is also just a show
You probably expect them to be buddies with Russia and have communist tendencies
They’re more capitalist than us and ruled by a monopoly, called Sheriff; Their largest trade partner is the fucking EU
And the war against Transnistria
Started by agitators saying that russians’ jobs will be taken away, us led by a traitorous government as always (Snegur) and them led by military and cossacks
I talked to quite a few soldiers who fought in this war, they all said the same - they were ordered to retreat back from the frontline after they got close to enemy cities
They had no choice but to obey Chisinau’s orders
During that time, more cossacks and fighters were brought from Ukraine
Also, they have all our important factories on their territory, plus a big city on OUR side of the river Nistru
The whole situation is a mess
I’d say, stop pretending it’s still part of us, leave it go, build new factories here if possible, and forget the past
Hey that’s the town from Vikings isn’t it
What the fuck lmao is there actually a town named like that
"Oh you're Russian, right
" "Where is that
" "Say something in MOLDOVAN please
Oh, also, when I would tell people I'm cold, in Winter, some of them would say: "But isn't it much colder in Moldova
" like I'm supposed to be immune to cold, lol
I'm from Moldova and when I tell people that - their first reaction is : "Oh my god you're from Maldives
You must be rich,right
" and I'm crying because Moldova is one the poorest countries in the EU
Were you in school during communist times
Otherwise, I’m “sure” that happened
even in our shit education schools here in moldova they taught us what romania did and didn’t do in both world wars
Our president is Igor Dodon
We call him a condom because his name rymes with the russian word for condom ,,гандон" or gandon
Basically president condom
If I'm not wrong, I think a lot of them were removed, but not all (I remember seeing a Karl Marx statue in a park some years ago)
I think all of them should be demolished, we don't need statues of foreign leaders who invaded us and sent our people to gulags in Siberia or of the people who invented this horrid ideology
A lot of street names were replaced too, but still not all of them
The depressing communist buildings also, but that would take a while
“Diveristy is our value”  “be more like west europe” “western europe is against racism and discrimination” yeah my ass it is
This just ruined my opinion on them (germans, swedes, spaniards etc) tbh
Yeah that’s an improvement from the lazy “romanians are gypsies” stereotype
Yeah that’s an improvement from the lazy “romanians are gypsies” stereotype
Honestly came to know about them from [this youtube video] Might have also heard it mentioned in some american movie but didn't really understand them at that moment
We don't have anything like that, but would be cool
Here are some that came to mind
"A călca pe bec" - Stepping on a light bulb
Used when someone makes a big mistake which usually has bad consequences
"A se uita ca boul la poartă nouă" - Looking at (something) like an ox looks at a new gate
Used when someone looks dumbstruck at something or someone
"Îți sare țandăra" - Splinters jump off you
Used when someone is very mad
"A fi turc" - To be a turk (not that polite)
Used when someone doesn't understand what you're saying
"La Paștele calului" - (Something will happen) at horses' Easter
When somebody says this it means that the thing you said before this will never happen
"A-și lua inima-n dinți" - Getting your heart in your teeth
This corresponds with the english phrase "You need to man up" as in you need to be courageous or daring
"A avea ac de cojocul cuiva" - Having a needle for somebody's coat
When you say this, it mean that you know just the way to get back at someone
"A nu avea cei șapte ani de-acasă" - To not have those 7 years at home
As in your parents didn't bring you up well (people here go to school when they're 7), you're misbehaved and uneducated
"A-și lua nasul la purtare" - Getting your nose to your behaviour
This means that you've become rude or insolent and that before you were a good person
"A face haz de necaz" - Laughing off your trouble
When you don't do anything about the bad situation you're in and you just laugh it off
"A vorbi aiurea-n tramvai" - to speak nonsensically in the tram
When someone is talking nonsense
>Quedarse con la boca abierta
We also have that one: "A rămâne cu gura căscată" - To remain with the mouth gaping
btw this is the literal translation that's why it might not make any sense lol
Moldovan here
Contrary to what other people said here, from my perspective, if ten-twenty years ago ~5% agreed to unification here, now it’s about ~30% of our population
The unification sentiment is definitely growing
Especially among the young and educated, who side with EU and Romania
But I definitely wouldn’t ask on reddit, honestly the romanian community here is very biased (but not in the way you’d think, they just shit on anything good about romania AND moldova)
That being said, I’m sure it’ll happen, it’s a matter of when
And that when is possibly between 15 and 50 years, but only time will tell
This might be a little late but I wanted to talk from the perspective of a young moldovan high schooler raised in a very pro-romanian/uniting family
Nowadays,we are taught everything in school about our history with Romania and how the USSR destroyed and trampled on my ancestors and lands how they wanted
The majority of young people are pro-union here,we never wanted to be separated from our brothers and sisters in the first place - and it's very moving to hear and see how much we're fighting for our wishes and voices to be heard when at the present time Moldova is in a very corrupt and bad place politically (and economically)
I could even affirm a lot of middle aged and old people that have lived through the soviet union and even the wars and hunger strikes (my living grandma as an example) want to unite with Romania,but sadly they don't see it happen because of old age and the dire conditions the country is now in
As of now,many corrupt politicians just use this 'unification' trope to lure people in and never actually do something about it
There are even parties (the one that the current president Dodon comes from) that are pro-russian and want to unite with Russia,letting Putin meddle his nose in our internal affairs and dictate things
I would say that maybe someday - we could be a whole Romania again,but till then we need to put apart our differences and start educating more brain washed pro-russian or anti-union people on romanian history that has been existing since Burebista and Decebal in the years of 87 B.C.
I hope this at least cleared some misunderstandings,even though it came a little late ! It makes me happy that people from other countries and cultures that have nothing in common with us would like to be more informed on our matters
There are some people who support the unification, but most likely it will never happen
Alexanderfeld probably
The first day of Spring (1st of March) is connected with giving mărțișori (red and white tassel) to the people you know, it celebrates the coming of spring
hey, my name is ludwig
We speak a romance language even though the roman empire never ever reached our land, yet the balkans, which were under roman control for so long, have almost no romance speakers left
No, Russians, not every one of us is a construction worker
Стелите плитку и паркет сами )
Слава Украине )) Is сало as beloved as they say
Hi, you were pretty close, but the poorest country in Europe -- that would be us :')
We *are* literarily the poorest country in Europe though :') And yes, lots and lots of wine
Also, be careful, some overly nationalistic people will throw a tantrum over being called romanian )
Russian
I think mostly people know some Ukrainian, some banners and all of the plaques are in Ukrainian, but Russian is the one mostly heard in the streets
documentary about Moldova
channel about a american(i think) in Moldova it's pretty interesting, 3 episodes so far
The flag of medieval [Wallachia] , it’s pretty unique in my opinion
Also, medieval [Moldavia] . Both flag stand out and are quite simplistic and recognizable
I'm pretty sure that "Сука блять пиздец" is the default phrase for a hefty number of Russian speakers
От души ваще, братишка.
Russia : they ripped us apart from Romania a long time ago; trampled on our traditions,language,history ; killed and deported the majority of families that were pro-union and anti- USSR, stole our national treasure (don't really know the word in english) and basically still heavily involve themselves in our politics and country even though we gained independence in 1991
And Russia still has military on the border of Transnistria/Moldova - which means they can attack us at all times without us being able to defend ourselves
Not to mention the sheer number of russians in my country that refuse to acknowledge history,refuse to learn romanian,vote for socialist parties,call our language 'moldavian' .In general I know that a lot of countries that have been under the communist regime still suffer from the same things that my nation does,and I think the only way to resolve them is to at least gain total independence from them
Not really, just banter, I have an extremely strong Moldovan accent, lol
I also usually make fun of the way people in Bucharest talk, the way they switch up their "ă" and "e", so it's not one sided
I shit you not, North Korea is our second tier neighbour
> Austria has the Euro
and you don't ?
Informally it is used as 'mate' or something like this, someone you know well but can't call 'friend'
Not that farfetched actually
Might happen in the future, I hope
It’s a pretty complex situation but it wouldn’t be impossible to handle with a decent government
Although Romania doesn’t do autonomous regions they do grant a lot of benefits to ethnic minorities, and unlike romanians in ukraine, ukrainians and hungarians (for example) are taught their language, are free to express their culture etc
Gagauzia would be better off like that than in ukraine, or russia’s hands
Or they could just become independent but they’re pretty much a bunch of  villages
Transnistria, on the other hand
Russian army is present there, and unless ukraine and/or Moldova joins NATO we can’t take it back
I’d say it should just split off, we’re better off without it
Well first off, after the Soviet Union collapsed, much military equipment was left in the region
Ukraine until not long ago was not pro-west
You can imagine how pro-russia moldova was back in the 90s if part of the country still is today
Russia could just freely bring munition and supplies, if not through ukraine, then through moldova with planes
Russian agents traveled freely
They don’t really need military equipment now as the fighting is not active, but the military is still there, ready to intervene if anything happens
I hope I answered your question
I can't believe no one mentioned this already: VOWEL HARMONY
If there are both short- and long-front vowels in a word it's most likely a European language (although not a rule), if there's only one sort of vowels or the other it's most likely a Finno-Ugric or a Turkic language or any other language that exhibits vowel harmony
0 but we have Jysk instead
I recommend “Life Begins on Friday” by Ioana Pârvulescu
First time I'm proud to be a moldovan
We, the people of Moldova, are very happy right now
We won despite the massive voter fraud commited by the other candidate
Finally, we can start to get rid of corruption
Im so happy we finally got a president that will change the country
Same
I have to say that, offcourse it wasn't the reason she won
We didn't had someone with such integrity in a long time
Considering how conservative we still are, it's a huge progress
She's center-right, which in the context of Eastern Europe basically means progressive (even the green party here is center/center-right)
Her program includes :
-Expansion of forested areas from 12
5% to 25%.
-Minimum pension of 2000 lei (for context, nowadays pensions can go as low as 800 lei and 2000, even if still low, would help a lot)

Agree, the amount of shit she ate as minister of education in 2015 pushing reforms and kicked then out by her corupt party
Then close defeat at presidentials in 2016 to same guy
Then betrayal from allied party (needed to abduct the oligarchy) in 2019 - kicked from position of prime-Minister after 5 months to be replaced with a more conformist one
All this while being called " a frail lesbian with no boobs".
Also Moldova is a Parliamentary country, so not much impact can be done

I doubt that russian generals that lost in WW1 or partisan organizers like Trotsky could face a mechanized enemy in a new era of warfare
his mistake was not trusting Zhukov , a guy that actually good at this new type of warfare
a civil war isn't as hard to micromanage as a world war , he was good at transforming unorganized gangs into a rebel army but that is not enough for an actual war
those are rookie numbers, i've never been in a class under 30 in Romania

The language is pretty easy too, one guy told me that in 3 months he could already understand Italian, and in half a year he was speaking fluently
lmao Romania
They are more Romanian than you mate, since they were born in Romania and lived there before emigrating
That explains Bulgaria
It just highlights the importance of integrating the community in question
They won't magically disappear overnight, so the state needs to help them become civilised
Sure, but less Romanian than Romas, if you weren't born and lived most of your life in Romania
Don't expect people in Britain, or in any other foreign country, to start segregating and have opinions on every ethnic group from said countries
In countrries like France and Germany they probably have hundreds of different ethnic groups who were born there
Thus they judge everyone who came from abroad by citizenship/national identity, which makes sense

Beautiful picture
For people looking at this as a sign of multiculturalism that worked properly:
1) Bukovina is a name given by the Habsburgs, later Austrohungarians after they bought the region from the Ottomans - it was just North Moldova until then; Moldova had no say in it
2) There were few Poles and probably no Germans until then ; Jews were most probably present but not at the same degree as after the annexation
Germans and Hungarians came for administrative purposes and left after the unification in 1918 ( Quite a few Germans did not leave until 1939, correction) my great-greatgrandfather received a house where Germans used to live
3) The only real mixing happened between Ukrainians, Moldavians and some Poles - even so, people knew which village was Ukrainian, Polish, Romanian
Ukrainian ancestry also built itself over centuries, as Romanians and Ukrainians lived together for 700 years at the least
I can't say much about the Hungarians but they probably mixed, to a limit, though I remember them leaving after 1918 as well
In reality, mixing was still mostly only between Orthodox Christians - people still lived in separate communities and the Germans, Hungarians and (probably) Jews viewed themselves as the people that brought civilization to these parts
Nationalism and separatism was rampant, especially in Romanians and Ukrainians, who viewed Bukovina as their ancestral land and wanted to lead themselves
The current split of Bukovina, with the southern half in Romania and the northern part in Ukraine was the best solution, despite it being enforced by the Soviets
Even so, a chunk of the northern part had and still has a considerable Romanian population, but as I said above, Ukrainians and Moldavians/Romanians were not belligerent against each other to truly separate (as opposed to Poles and Ukrainians, see Lviv/Pokutia)
Bullshit about the Germans

>When Romania signed a peace treaty with the Soviets in 1944, the German military began withdrawing the Saxons from Transylvania; this operation was most thorough with the Saxons of the Nösnerland (Bistrița area)
Around 100,000 Germans fled before the Soviet [Red Army] **but Romania did not conduct the** [**expulsion of Germans**] **as did neighboring countries at war's end**. However, more than 70,000 Germans from Romania were [arrested by the Soviet Army and sent to labour camps] in contemporary [Ukraine] for alleged cooperation with Nazi Germany
>Because they are considered [*Auslandsdeutsche*] ("Germans from abroad") by the German government, the Saxons have the right to German citizenship under the law of return
Numerous Saxons have emigrated to [Germany] especially after the fall of the [Eastern Bloc] in 1989 and are represented by the [Association of Transylvanian Saxons in Germany] Due to this emigration from Romania the population of Saxons is dwindling
At the same time, especially after Romania's accession into [NATO] and the [EU] many Transylvanian Saxons are returning from Germany, reclaiming property lost to the former Communist regime and/or starting up [small and medium-sized enterprises] The Saxons remaining in Romania are represented by the [Democratic Forum of Germans in Romania] (FDGR/DFDR), the political party that gave Romania its fifth president, [Klaus Iohannis]

oh yeah
Even if I myself am from Moldova, I do not consider the autonomy of Transnistria worthy of recognition
i'd say yes
Transnistria it's a fake country
It's a puppet state made by Russia
Transnistria is not perceived as a self-sufficient state even if it has a president, own money and passport
It is  still largely dependent on support from Russia, which is the main reason why society does not have a chance to develop and why the region is still not an independent political player
The question should be: "Do you ever forget that Moldova is just sitting there
In romanian children’s books bears say “mor mor” which is pretty similar to the finnish “murmur”, lol

Part of a country that voted for uniting with Romania, whose majority is Romanian and was oppressed for hundreds of years by their conquerors
Sorry, I was joking :) we don’t have a true rival except transnistria, but that’s an internal conflict
it was a joke, sorry if you took it seriously
It’s because we don’t really have a rival nation - except the separatist transnistria, but that’s considered civil war/internal conflict
Those "mild" policies caused the ethnic makeup of Transylvania to go from 62% Romanians and 23% Hungarians to 51% Romanians and 31% Hungarians, also because nationalities weren't recognised only the mother tongue of a person was, and even earlier when Hungary was a Kingdom the conquered Romanian nobles were magyarized and converted to Catholicism
Romanians had no rights and the Hungarian government only wanted to give Romanians autonomy in the 1st World War because Romanian troops started advancing into Transylvania, otherwise they would've proceeded with their magyarization of the land
Also mind you the saxons also suffered from the magyarization and weren't on friendly terms with the Hungarians, they supported the union on the 8th of January after negotiations with Romanian politicians to ensure that their cultural rights would be protected under the Romanian state, since they weren't under the Hungarians
Yeah, they claim to be some kind of a “last remnant” of it, but they’re actually more capitalist than us (since there’s a big monopoly there that owns almost everything, called Sherrif) and it’s mostly just for show
Yeah rebelled with help from Daddy Russia who now has "peace-keeper" troops over there, transnistria can go to hell, it was never Romanian, the only thing that bothers me are the territories they control that are passed the river border

Weird, flags are usually attached to poles
That's insane
Traditional music, when I was a child I considered it super boring and unpleasant (I listened to american music a lot and I considered our traditional music outdated and primitive)
I thought only old people and rural villagers could listen to that
But now, I can appreciate a good folk song or new music that adapts those songs into a kind of folk-rap-dubsteb mix
Subcarpați for example, they manage to make folk music sound way cooler and it sounds up to date
Via Dacă is good too
It seems more and more young people enjoy it
Yes, me too
Am înțeles aproape tot, dar asta e deoarece vorbesc româna, italiana și învăț și spaniola lol, oricum nu cred că ceilalți vorbitori de limbi neo-latine vor înțelege mare lucru din ceea ce-am scris
And Romanians can practically understand most of italian and Spanish but no one understands them, even though Romanian is technically the 4th closest language to latin lol
Am înțeles cam 70% din ceea ce-ai zis lol, chiar dacă circa 30% din cuvintele românești provin din franceză, limba asta e cea mai grea de descifrat pentru mine
Cuvintele franceze tot din latină sunt lol, așa că procentajul e de circa 80% nu 30%
Româna are multe cuvinte care chiar dacă provin din latină nu sunt prezente în vocabularul celorlalte limbi neo-latine sau au avut o evoluție diferită, de aceea și pare mai grea de înțeles pentru vorbitorii de portugheză, italiană, spaniolă etc
Limba cea mai aproape limbii române (excluzând aromâna) este italiana, cu care limba română are circa 78% de cuvinte derivate de la o rădăcină comună, extrem de puțin dacă compari de exemplu franceza cu italiana (89% de cuvinte care au aceeași rădăcină)
Nu aș zice, română e a patra cea mai aproape limbă de latină, după spaniolă, faptul că românii au fost izolați de celelate limbi romanice de-alungul timpului a făcut ca limba noastră să evolueze pe căi diferite, faptul că vorbitorii altor limbi neo-latine nu ne-ar înțelege, nu e necesar vina influențelor slave, pentru că noi pe voi vă înțelegem destul de bine
Voce înseamnă voce și în română lol
Ce-ai citit tu e adevărat, italienii folosesc multe cuvinte care există și în română dar sunt utilizate mai rar sau au o altă semnificație, de exemplu:
Portare - in italiană înseamnă "a aduce"
Purta - are aceeași rădăcină cu italienescul "portare" dar are un înțeles diferit, corespunde plus minus cu "indossare" în italiană
It would look like ours then
Gion meid his uăi tu ei tăvern  tru dă darc forest, onli tu faind aut dat hi forgot dă mani
In Romanian: Ion a ajuns la cârciumă prin întunecata pădure, doar pentru a-și da seama ca și-a uitat banii
They meant how it would be written so that you would read it like in english xD “Gion meid his uei tu ă tavărn tru dă darc forest, onli tu faind aut dat hi forgot dă moni” something like that
He/She’s asking for the phonetic script, so “John is walking through the forest” would be something like “Gion iz ualching tru dă forăst”

Same thing here, one thing I'd like to add ia that people from the country also don't like city-folk, thinking they're lazy, sophisticated, etc
It's not uncommon to hear (at least over here) that: "Toți orășenii sunt trântori" lol
You're talking about the Republic of Moldova
Cause I've never heard "pilitură de osânză" in my entire life, and I live there
it's not Russian but Old Church Slavonic, a Southern Slavic language closely related to Bulgarian
Old Church Slavonic was the main lithurgical language for Orthodox Church)
Sure, not everywhere but it is still being used
Lol what
You want to tell me that you don't change classes every period
I remember when I went to school in Moldova that when we changed classes some teachers wouldn't let us in till the bell rung so we had to stay outside the class and wait for 15 minutes (break time), some would go outside or to the buffet (bar)
We have students that carry the register from classroom to classroom (the class president, "șeful clasei")
No, we were all divided into different classes (ex: a X-a "B") , every class had its schedule, so during break time (we had 15 minute breaks between every period) the halls were filled with students going to their specific classroom
People would leave their stuff in classroom and then they could just stay in classroom and wait till the bell rung or go to the buffet, go outside etc
Although, as I said, some teachers would tell us to wait outside the classroom till the bell rung, which was quite annoying
High School and Middle School too
Wait
You want to tell me that you don't use the latin derived terms for the days of the week
Whaaa
Mare mare
Lol
Romanian has 4 lol
Romania: their fight against corruption
They don’t just give up and say “that’s just how it is” (this is a huge problem in Moldova) when referring to the current situation
This might just be what will save them from poverty in the future - the fact that they expect more from their country and they actually make an effort for it
Romania is on the right path and has a lot of potential, and I hope we follow their tracks
Ukraine: it takes some massive balls to stand up to the russian government, russia being right next to you, having annexed Crimea and helped rebels in donbas
I hope more of us can stand up to them as well, the russian people deserve a better leadership
I hope Ukraine will continue on the right path, they have potential
Transnistria: I like the city Tighina
Can we borrow it
^jk
^except ^if
^Nah ^just ^kidding
^^unless
By loyal, do you mean "Russian puppet" by any chance
Georgia is on there, I guess he didn't mean that then
a = to , as in “to walk” would be “a merge”.
e = is, as in “he is tall” would be “el e înalt”.
o = oh (interjection) as in “oh, that’s cool” OR o = a , as in “a woman is dancing” would be “o femeie danseaza” (only for female words)
It's definitely perceived as rude to ask about someone's wage, unless it's between family and close friends
Most people in Europe are at least bilingual though
Might explain why some have differently sized ears

Ungheni (Moldova) and Ungheni (Romania), although it’s not exactly halved, most of the city is on our part of the river Prut (which separates it in two parts) and a bit of it is in Romania

i love playing playing poland in civilization V, because its abilities are so overpowered :D
I think that has to be an Israeli one
Another one was from Oman, I think (not sure about it)
Given that that was in Moldova, that's quite exotic
There are some US ones, but that's not that surprising cause a lot of people here import cars (mostly hybrid) from America
not a custom but I still do it and get weird looks
some of them are quite nice though and it seems that the 'thank you' kinda makes their day less annoying
Romania looks like a fish and Moldova like a grape lol
I certainly agree with your opinion
>Really our connection with the Bulgarians is underrated, our history is intertwined at so many points in time and it's a shame that our time in the Bulgarian Empires is so criminally unmentioned in our schools
Can I ask you why are you such a bulghar fanboy
>The Bulghars were our main source of slavificstion and we also got along with them pretty well
You think slavification is a good thing
Lol, it wasn't even slavification since we still speak a latin language, and Bulgarian loan words make up only 2% of romanian words (for reference 22% of our vocabulary is comprised of french words)
Musaca - greek, ghiveci - turkish, sarmale - turkish, maybe the turks are our brothers, lmao
>Saying slavification didn't happen becaude we still speak a Romance language is like saying I didn't paint a wall because only a bit is actually with paint on, Slavs still had a major impact on Romanian
Slavification would mean getting entirely replaced by slavs
>This is only talking about modern Romanian, which is after the big attempt to latinise our language after the 19th century when many slavic words were replaced
Frenchify*, in fact a lot of archaic words originating from latin got replaced during that time
>Previous to that an even bigger amount of slavic words were used, and Romanian was commonly regarded at that time as a Slavic language
It wasn't? And if it were it's because of people being ignorant, literally an italian scholar went to the Romanian states in the 15th or 16th century, saying that people there speak a romance langauge, and also, as I said previously, there were also a lot of archaic latin derived words that were used, if you read old texts (16th century)  you'd see that the overwhelming majority of words there are of latin origin
>Throwing out the fact that a food originates from one place and not from another doesn't really mean anything as to in what culture it can be traditional in
It does, it means that these cultures interacted a lot and weren't as hated as you may think, lol
>Idk why you oppose the fact that we and the Bulgarians do have stuff in common, genuinely curious about that
I don't, I'm generally curious why you're sucking their dick so hard, unless you perceive being "slavified" and having a cyrillic alphabet as something uniting
Transnistria
Rusia sponsored a civil war beacouse they wanted communism and they  won but the land is so tiny nobody but Rusia says its its own state
But that have their own currency gouverment and an army that exedes ours
ok but what about Găgăuzia lol
I literally don't know anything about what's going on there
Beacouse that place is not so radical unlike Transnistria
yea but what's happening there lol
also, it's spelled 'because', pal
Its just self-administred
ish
Make it so the Turks won the war against Russia in 1813
Edit: Actually, now that I think about it, I would make it so Michael the Brave wouldn't be betrayed and killed, because that would have united all Romanians under one banner 300 earlier
Wine, every single person in the countryside has a wine cellar and they've probably produced wine before
Negatively, because those builders are treated like garbage and many actually died
FIFA shouldn't have enabled this
It will be partially boycotted anyway
Watching the World Cup in winter won't feel the same
It's called Ketchunnaise, and it's super popular in the ex-soviet countries as far as I know
It's a poor man's sauce, and we embrace the fact
It's like drinking cheap alcohol: you know it's the worst option you can take, but also the only one most of the time
Russians also call it ketchunnaise
our memes are pretty funny since they usually mix up Russian with Romanian so basically no one really understands them except for us lol
Also, "Jassy" (Iași), which both looks and sounds horrible
I think that most of us think of Romania as a mix between Dacian and Roman culture (which isn't that true)
Too bad we don't really know anything about the Dacians
We only have one and it's a part of a bigger Cultural Site, the Struve Geodetic Arc
Is it weird for you that we call it “Portugalia” here
So do you guys call welsh people “little brits”? :)
As far as I know, there’s no word in english that has that sound to give as an example, but you could write România” in google translate romanian language, and press the speaker so you can know what it sounds like
Sasha is a form of both Aleksandr (masculine) and Aleskandra (feminine)
I don't really know, I just know that Sasha is either Aleksandr or Aleksandra
Probably ks turns into sh as it is in Aleksei - Alyosha
BTW there is also another diminutive form of Aleksandr - Shurik (SHOO-reek), Shura for women
The opposite happened to me when I moved to Italy, at first I used to speak in English with people around me and we couldn't really understand each other since their knowledge of the language was quite basic (my Italian was at a very basic level too and i was feeling kind of embarrassed when speaking it) , but when I started speaking Italian to them after half a month or so of studying the language they started only speaking Italian with me and never switched again, which i am very thankful for
Transnistria, it’s basically de facto independent (own currency, passports, border controls) and I wish we would just
let it go away at this point
Problem is, the whole “hostility” between Moldova and Transnistria is just a show
Moldova’s government is just as traitorous as the separatists are, to the people of the country
If I remember correctly, [A high ranking transnistrian separatist official arrived at the Chisinau airport after a vacation in Egypt with his family
with police bodyguards surrounding him, he was allowed to skip the wait for the passport control
Journalists recorded it all
Our state’s leadership literally doesn’t give a fuck anymore and it’s sad
(link is not in english, sorry)]  also, Transnistria’s whole “last bastion of communism” is also just a show
You probably expect them to be buddies with Russia and have communist tendencies
They’re more capitalist than us and ruled by a monopoly, called Sheriff; Their largest trade partner is the fucking EU
And the war against Transnistria
Started by agitators saying that russians’ jobs will be taken away, us led by a traitorous government as always (Snegur) and them led by military and cossacks
I talked to quite a few soldiers who fought in this war, they all said the same - they were ordered to retreat back from the frontline after they got close to enemy cities
They had no choice but to obey Chisinau’s orders
During that time, more cossacks and fighters were brought from Ukraine
Also, they have all our important factories on their territory, plus a big city on OUR side of the river Nistru
The whole situation is a mess
I’d say, stop pretending it’s still part of us, leave it go, build new factories here if possible, and forget the past
Hey that’s the town from Vikings isn’t it
What the fuck lmao is there actually a town named like that
"Oh you're Russian, right
" "Where is that
" "Say something in MOLDOVAN please
Oh, also, when I would tell people I'm cold, in Winter, some of them would say: "But isn't it much colder in Moldova
" like I'm supposed to be immune to cold, lol
I'm from Moldova and when I tell people that - their first reaction is : "Oh my god you're from Maldives
You must be rich,right
" and I'm crying because Moldova is one the poorest countries in the EU
Were you in school during communist times
Otherwise, I’m “sure” that happened
even in our shit education schools here in moldova they taught us what romania did and didn’t do in both world wars
Our president is Igor Dodon
We call him a condom because his name rymes with the russian word for condom ,,гандон" or gandon
Basically president condom
If I'm not wrong, I think a lot of them were removed, but not all (I remember seeing a Karl Marx statue in a park some years ago)
I think all of them should be demolished, we don't need statues of foreign leaders who invaded us and sent our people to gulags in Siberia or of the people who invented this horrid ideology
A lot of street names were replaced too, but still not all of them
The depressing communist buildings also, but that would take a while
“Diveristy is our value”  “be more like west europe” “western europe is against racism and discrimination” yeah my ass it is
This just ruined my opinion on them (germans, swedes, spaniards etc) tbh
Yeah that’s an improvement from the lazy “romanians are gypsies” stereotype
Yeah that’s an improvement from the lazy “romanians are gypsies” stereotype
Honestly came to know about them from [this youtube video] Might have also heard it mentioned in some american movie but didn't really understand them at that moment
We don't have anything like that, but would be cool
Here are some that came to mind
"A călca pe bec" - Stepping on a light bulb
Used when someone makes a big mistake which usually has bad consequences
"A se uita ca boul la poartă nouă" - Looking at (something) like an ox looks at a new gate
Used when someone looks dumbstruck at something or someone
"Îți sare țandăra" - Splinters jump off you
Used when someone is very mad
"A fi turc" - To be a turk (not that polite)
Used when someone doesn't understand what you're saying
"La Paștele calului" - (Something will happen) at horses' Easter
When somebody says this it means that the thing you said before this will never happen
"A-și lua inima-n dinți" - Getting your heart in your teeth
This corresponds with the english phrase "You need to man up" as in you need to be courageous or daring
"A avea ac de cojocul cuiva" - Having a needle for somebody's coat
When you say this, it mean that you know just the way to get back at someone
"A nu avea cei șapte ani de-acasă" - To not have those 7 years at home
As in your parents didn't bring you up well (people here go to school when they're 7), you're misbehaved and uneducated
"A-și lua nasul la purtare" - Getting your nose to your behaviour
This means that you've become rude or insolent and that before you were a good person
"A face haz de necaz" - Laughing off your trouble
When you don't do anything about the bad situation you're in and you just laugh it off
"A vorbi aiurea-n tramvai" - to speak nonsensically in the tram
When someone is talking nonsense
>Quedarse con la boca abierta
We also have that one: "A rămâne cu gura căscată" - To remain with the mouth gaping
btw this is the literal translation that's why it might not make any sense lol
Moldovan here
Contrary to what other people said here, from my perspective, if ten-twenty years ago ~5% agreed to unification here, now it’s about ~30% of our population
The unification sentiment is definitely growing
Especially among the young and educated, who side with EU and Romania
But I definitely wouldn’t ask on reddit, honestly the romanian community here is very biased (but not in the way you’d think, they just shit on anything good about romania AND moldova)
That being said, I’m sure it’ll happen, it’s a matter of when
And that when is possibly between 15 and 50 years, but only time will tell
This might be a little late but I wanted to talk from the perspective of a young moldovan high schooler raised in a very pro-romanian/uniting family
Nowadays,we are taught everything in school about our history with Romania and how the USSR destroyed and trampled on my ancestors and lands how they wanted
The majority of young people are pro-union here,we never wanted to be separated from our brothers and sisters in the first place - and it's very moving to hear and see how much we're fighting for our wishes and voices to be heard when at the present time Moldova is in a very corrupt and bad place politically (and economically)
I could even affirm a lot of middle aged and old people that have lived through the soviet union and even the wars and hunger strikes (my living grandma as an example) want to unite with Romania,but sadly they don't see it happen because of old age and the dire conditions the country is now in
As of now,many corrupt politicians just use this 'unification' trope to lure people in and never actually do something about it
There are even parties (the one that the current president Dodon comes from) that are pro-russian and want to unite with Russia,letting Putin meddle his nose in our internal affairs and dictate things
I would say that maybe someday - we could be a whole Romania again,but till then we need to put apart our differences and start educating more brain washed pro-russian or anti-union people on romanian history that has been existing since Burebista and Decebal in the years of 87 B.C.
I hope this at least cleared some misunderstandings,even though it came a little late ! It makes me happy that people from other countries and cultures that have nothing in common with us would like to be more informed on our matters
There are some people who support the unification, but most likely it will never happen
Alexanderfeld probably
The first day of Spring (1st of March) is connected with giving mărțișori (red and white tassel) to the people you know, it celebrates the coming of spring
hey, my name is ludwig
We speak a romance language even though the roman empire never ever reached our land, yet the balkans, which were under roman control for so long, have almost no romance speakers left
No, Russians, not every one of us is a construction worker
Стелите плитку и паркет сами )
Слава Украине )) Is сало as beloved as they say
Hi, you were pretty close, but the poorest country in Europe -- that would be us :')
We *are* literarily the poorest country in Europe though :') And yes, lots and lots of wine
Also, be careful, some overly nationalistic people will throw a tantrum over being called romanian )
Russian
I think mostly people know some Ukrainian, some banners and all of the plaques are in Ukrainian, but Russian is the one mostly heard in the streets
documentary about Moldova
channel about a american(i think) in Moldova it's pretty interesting, 3 episodes so far
The flag of medieval [Wallachia] , it’s pretty unique in my opinion
Also, medieval [Moldavia] . Both flag stand out and are quite simplistic and recognizable
I'm pretty sure that "Сука блять пиздец" is the default phrase for a hefty number of Russian speakers
От души ваще, братишка.
Russia : they ripped us apart from Romania a long time ago; trampled on our traditions,language,history ; killed and deported the majority of families that were pro-union and anti- USSR, stole our national treasure (don't really know the word in english) and basically still heavily involve themselves in our politics and country even though we gained independence in 1991
And Russia still has military on the border of Transnistria/Moldova - which means they can attack us at all times without us being able to defend ourselves
Not to mention the sheer number of russians in my country that refuse to acknowledge history,refuse to learn romanian,vote for socialist parties,call our language 'moldavian' .In general I know that a lot of countries that have been under the communist regime still suffer from the same things that my nation does,and I think the only way to resolve them is to at least gain total independence from them
Not really, just banter, I have an extremely strong Moldovan accent, lol
I also usually make fun of the way people in Bucharest talk, the way they switch up their "ă" and "e", so it's not one sided
I shit you not, North Korea is our second tier neighbour
> Austria has the Euro
and you don't ?
Informally it is used as 'mate' or something like this, someone you know well but can't call 'friend'
Not that farfetched actually
Might happen in the future, I hope
It’s a pretty complex situation but it wouldn’t be impossible to handle with a decent government
Although Romania doesn’t do autonomous regions they do grant a lot of benefits to ethnic minorities, and unlike romanians in ukraine, ukrainians and hungarians (for example) are taught their language, are free to express their culture etc
Gagauzia would be better off like that than in ukraine, or russia’s hands
Or they could just become independent but they’re pretty much a bunch of  villages
Transnistria, on the other hand
Russian army is present there, and unless ukraine and/or Moldova joins NATO we can’t take it back
I’d say it should just split off, we’re better off without it
Well first off, after the Soviet Union collapsed, much military equipment was left in the region
Ukraine until not long ago was not pro-west
You can imagine how pro-russia moldova was back in the 90s if part of the country still is today
Russia could just freely bring munition and supplies, if not through ukraine, then through moldova with planes
Russian agents traveled freely
They don’t really need military equipment now as the fighting is not active, but the military is still there, ready to intervene if anything happens
I hope I answered your question
I can't believe no one mentioned this already: VOWEL HARMONY
If there are both short- and long-front vowels in a word it's most likely a European language (although not a rule), if there's only one sort of vowels or the other it's most likely a Finno-Ugric or a Turkic language or any other language that exhibits vowel harmony
0 but we have Jysk instead
I recommend “Life Begins on Friday” by Ioana Pârvulescu
First time I'm proud to be a moldovan
We, the people of Moldova, are very happy right now
We won despite the massive voter fraud commited by the other candidate
Finally, we can start to get rid of corruption
Im so happy we finally got a president that will change the country
Same
I have to say that, offcourse it wasn't the reason she won
We didn't had someone with such integrity in a long time
Considering how conservative we still are, it's a huge progress
She's center-right, which in the context of Eastern Europe basically means progressive (even the green party here is center/center-right)
Her program includes :
-Expansion of forested areas from 12
5% to 25%.
-Minimum pension of 2000 lei (for context, nowadays pensions can go as low as 800 lei and 2000, even if still low, would help a lot)
-The re-evaluation of property of lawyers and other rich, usually corrupt people
- Healthcare reforms
- Bigger salaries for teachers and medics
If u want to use google translate, here's an article in Romanian with everything she promised to do:
Also she is very progressive and supports stuff like same sex marriage
I hope this was helpful
Yesss
Multumim
Politic, suntem natiuni diferite, dar cultural si lingvistic suntem una si aceeasi natiune
Agree, the amount of shit she ate as minister of education in 2015 pushing reforms and kicked then out by her corupt party
Then close defeat at presidentials in 2016 to same guy
Then betrayal from allied party (needed to abduct the oligarchy) in 2019 - kicked from position of prime-Minister after 5 months to be replaced with a more conformist one
All this while being called " a frail lesbian with no boobs".
Also Moldova is a Parliamentary country, so not much impact can be done
Puie Mutin

Do you want her responsibilities
Yeah, knowing the language helps
Most of European graphs be like  "you're not in the EU
Then we don't care about you"
Wow I'm Moldovian and did not  expect this
Ya same
"Unbiased" lol
But ye, true
Ye true fellow Moldavian
Damn, thanks to the quarantine even the Roman Empire is coming back
If it makes you feel better, it’s kinda mixed in the USA
If stupidity had a photo it's a Slav (even moreso a Polish) throwing Nazi gestures
They wanted you wiped off the face of Earth and were actually successful in killing quite a couple of millions
As a pole myself, this really makes me want to rally with them
In 2018 PM of Armenia resigned after protests and his successor was from opposition
Russia didn't interfere
In case of Belarus, I guess Russia will directly interfere only if military alliance with Belarus will be threatened

I mean you still can, there’s no limit per each country ;)
I can't say the same for the portion sizes, but the fat shaming culture is definitely a big thing here as well
Io guys , what will happen with traveling ? Will we need ( another EU ) countries need to make a visa to travel in UK ?
I wish Moldova was there
Call me Monsieur from now on
[as if it weren't already]
I wouldn’t go that far, it may seem Greek because the Illyrians where in close contact with the Greeks
But i’m pretty sure they made it themselves
Romania and Moldova both on 1996 cause they are kinda the same
Fck communism
Looks cool and traditional, but that's not typical
People just use suits and wedding dresses nowadays

It's been 28 years for Moldova and they are not even linked by a common border
Ukraine would be lucky to ever get that back
Same here lol, if someone here says "no thank you" to that, they usually mean that they do want that chocolate
Wow, even from Moldova
I'm surprised
Dupa 30 de ani

So nothing has changed for us
Welcome to Russia were stupidity is at home
You underestimate the levels of propaganda on Russian TV
They literally tell people in the news that Russia without Putin wouldn’t survive as a country
As soon as Putin is gone the big bad Americans will take over the country
20 years of shit like this everyday does its job
["From the Varangians to the Greeks"] huh ?
I mean we do kinda claim Corvin, he's literally mentioned in our anthem, lol
It was majority Romanian for most of its history, till the magyarisation happened (even with that, Romanians represented over 50% of the population) and no, it's not "diverse" anymore, as much as you would like to claim that it is
every regime built on lies would eventually collapse
Moldova's prime minister is participating at his son's wedding roughly 1 week after banning weddings
He's still in office
Why is gipsy/rroma flag only on romania
They are prevalent all over the balkans, turkey, and spain, so why do you contribute to that racist stereotype and only include it there specifically
"country"
Edgy
I doubt that russian generals that lost in WW1 or partisan organizers like Trotsky could face a mechanized enemy in a new era of warfare
his mistake was not trusting Zhukov , a guy that actually good at this new type of warfare
a civil war isn't as hard to micromanage as a world war , he was good at transforming unorganized gangs into a rebel army but that is not enough for an actual war
those are rookie numbers, i've never been in a class under 30 in Romania
Moldova's average is around 30

The .2 are probably Moldavians with Romanian passports
I know at least 5 people who moved to Italy
The language is pretty easy too, one guy told me that in 3 months he could already understand Italian, and in half a year he was speaking fluently
lmao Romania
They are more Romanian than you mate, since they were born in Romania and lived there before emigrating
That explains Bulgaria
It just highlights the importance of integrating the community in question
They won't magically disappear overnight, so the state needs to help them become civilised
Sure, but less Romanian than Romas, if you weren't born and lived most of your life in Romania
Don't expect people in Britain, or in any other foreign country, to start segregating and have opinions on every ethnic group from said countries
In countrries like France and Germany they probably have hundreds of different ethnic groups who were born there
Thus they judge everyone who came from abroad by citizenship/national identity, which makes sense
Am dreptate tho
Daca arati ca oamenii [din acest videou din Romania] ci nu ca cei din acela de mai sus din Moldova, atunci da, ai dreptate

Beautiful picture
For people looking at this as a sign of multiculturalism that worked properly:
1) Bukovina is a name given by the Habsburgs, later Austrohungarians after they bought the region from the Ottomans - it was just North Moldova until then; Moldova had no say in it
2) There were few Poles and probably no Germans until then ; Jews were most probably present but not at the same degree as after the annexation
Germans and Hungarians came for administrative purposes and left after the unification in 1918 ( Quite a few Germans did not leave until 1939, correction) my great-greatgrandfather received a house where Germans used to live
3) The only real mixing happened between Ukrainians, Moldavians and some Poles - even so, people knew which village was Ukrainian, Polish, Romanian
Ukrainian ancestry also built itself over centuries, as Romanians and Ukrainians lived together for 700 years at the least
I can't say much about the Hungarians but they probably mixed, to a limit, though I remember them leaving after 1918 as well
In reality, mixing was still mostly only between Orthodox Christians - people still lived in separate communities and the Germans, Hungarians and (probably) Jews viewed themselves as the people that brought civilization to these parts
Nationalism and separatism was rampant, especially in Romanians and Ukrainians, who viewed Bukovina as their ancestral land and wanted to lead themselves
The current split of Bukovina, with the southern half in Romania and the northern part in Ukraine was the best solution, despite it being enforced by the Soviets
Even so, a chunk of the northern part had and still has a considerable Romanian population, but as I said above, Ukrainians and Moldavians/Romanians were not belligerent against each other to truly separate (as opposed to Poles and Ukrainians, see Lviv/Pokutia)
Bullshit about the Germans
&#x200B;
>When Romania signed a peace treaty with the Soviets in 1944, the German military began withdrawing the Saxons from Transylvania; this operation was most thorough with the Saxons of the Nösnerland (Bistrița area)
Around 100,000 Germans fled before the Soviet [Red Army] **but Romania did not conduct the** [**expulsion of Germans**] **as did neighboring countries at war's end**. However, more than 70,000 Germans from Romania were [arrested by the Soviet Army and sent to labour camps] in contemporary [Ukraine] for alleged cooperation with Nazi Germany
>Because they are considered [*Auslandsdeutsche*] ("Germans from abroad") by the German government, the Saxons have the right to German citizenship under the law of return
Numerous Saxons have emigrated to [Germany] especially after the fall of the [Eastern Bloc] in 1989 and are represented by the [Association of Transylvanian Saxons in Germany] Due to this emigration from Romania the population of Saxons is dwindling
At the same time, especially after Romania's accession into [NATO] and the [EU] many Transylvanian Saxons are returning from Germany, reclaiming property lost to the former Communist regime and/or starting up [small and medium-sized enterprises] The Saxons remaining in Romania are represented by the [Democratic Forum of Germans in Romania] (FDGR/DFDR), the political party that gave Romania its fifth president, [Klaus Iohannis]

Yeah lol no
>Romania, are you Latin
