"Verdingkinder" basically orphans used as slavelabor
They were often mistreated
There is a movie about it if anyone is intrested
Women only gained the right to vote in 1971
When my mother was born, my grandma did not yet have the right to vote
Switzerland allowed some train transport from the nazis through our country in ww2 in exchange for not being invaded
the nazis promptly used that to transport Jews through Switzerland into concentration camps
edit: this is mostly speculation though
We didn't let women vote 'till 1971
Should I mention nazi gold too
Just googled them and in German they are apparently called "Samen" which also is the German word for semen
I mean Russia is dictatorship too
No ethnic german does this
My grandpa used to be a Verdingkind, parents gave him away for basicly nothing
That was pre WW2 so it was even worse
He wrote a book, well more like a diary, that is still family owned and it‘s absolutely heartbreaking to read through something a 14 year old wrote in pure fear
He got better as time went on, unfortunately I could never ask him about it personally since he died around 15 years ago and I was still really young back then
You're correct
Though there is some speculation that there was some war material (and soldiers) transported through Switzerland illegally in WW2, it's quite secured by historians that there were no "death trains" going through Switzerland
that too, ofc
lots of it is probably still in Swiss possession too
Germany, France or Italy
I don’t want to live in a landlocked country any longer
Well either Italy, because then we become a Mediterranean country or Germany, because then we have a northern coast and other advantages like no Germans
But
wouldn't they then go through Switzerland
Please don't.
Lol a new lake in Rome
Assisted suicide is legal, even for foreigners
That was like 10 years after the last swiss canton got women's voting rights
Halloween will be particularly scary this year
The UK is in troubles
I'd be ashamed if I were British
>given up with politics
You really shouldn't, no matter where you move to
It's risky business letting other people decide for you
Sure
Still not my idea of fun
Hadn't realised we were disagreeing on anything
The Halloween thing was obviously humorous
Sure
Do we even care
Well, I know I do
No comment
When the last of our cantons (states) finally had a vote to introduce women's suffrage ***in 1990***... and rejected it
When Norway was given to Sweden from Denmark as restitution for losing the Napoleonic wars
the only thing i can think of might be the nazi gold thing but that’s about it
or when we voted for those muslim towers to be illegal but no one really thought that would happen until it did
Or when Pro Juventute started a genocide of travellers (especially Yenish people)
Or when Appenzell Innerrhoden rejected the introduction of women's suffrage in **fucking 1990**
Yo we sold chocolates 5 franken each for them at school what the fuck
bruh moment
Genocide
Bitch you cookin
Not a genocide like the holocaust or the Rwandan genocide, but still
>The UN Genocide Convention, signed on 9 December 1948, qualifies forcibly transferring of children of a "national, ethnic, racial or religious group to another group" in the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, as a genocide
Hm that's interesting
I never thought about it this way
Is this a passage of Crime and Punishment
Nice work
Sorry
I don't know how most tools or some special cooking utensils are called in German
Because I learned about them online in English
Yes it's strange if I ask my dad to borrow the angle grinder and it's like "hey can I borrow that thing I always borrow but still don't know the name you know the one with the grinding thing that rotates".
Definitely, I'm living in the US and when I call my family I sometimes have a hard time finding the correct Swissgerman words
Also my actual German is on a whole other level of bad
My wife wants to learn German but I don't think I'm very helpful as a teacher
Lol
Interesting story: I used to speak English in a British Accent and still do
That because of DanTDM from whose videos I learned English and he's British so I speak English with a British accent
I still have a bit of my Swiss accent sometimes come through but that's only when I speak fast
I can also speak English with an American accent
Nope
If I talk "normally" it sounds meh and if I try to have a nice accent I sound posh but in a weird way so no
I'd like to think I've got a rather British accent that rubbed off from my English teachers
I do like the sound of a Swiss accent in English, it sounds cute
my dad, who's German, however has the most horrible, thick German accent and I don't like it at all
Maybe the stereotype exist because people mixed up Swiss people with Germans
Their "k" sounds like when you break a bone and with their "ch" they obviously try to imitate a tiger
Edit: Just remembered my Swiss tag
Grew up here but am German, that's why I said "they"
What's pretty special is that in France, you're mocked whether you have a thick French accent (because you're "too bad" ) or a very good "native" one (then you're showing off)
Whatever are you supposed to do
fuck the english accent how do i remove my Swiss accent from french
I feel like a pompous ass for trying to speak french as my accent isn't that Swiss but it still is noticeable so I feel like I'm trying to be French
Oh shit Hans
Karl call ze ambulance
Nein, Karl
Das ist ze panzerkampfwagen
It might be because of Germans migrating to the Mid-West
Who cares
Have you met an American
Americans care
A lot
For France, Marseille is an easy pick: a tremendously beautiful city and shoreline but really badly administered and a bit corrupted
Unfortunately it’s the second biggest city in France by population
Buildings literally collapsed a few months back because of their dire state, how can this happen in one the richest countries in the world, honestly
I was on vacation in Naples and what bothered me most is that there were no freaking toilet seats
Who steals toilet seats
But otherwise it was interesting, everytime I put my phone in my backpocket out of habit it only took 2 seconds for a Nonna or Nonno to appear and gesticulating that I shouldn't have it in there because it will get stolen
I'd never heard that about Biel, but you're kinda making it sound like Berne's Spreitenbach, which incidentally would be my nomination
Could bundle it together with neighboring Dietikon
Just two really hideous towns with lots of industry and massive immigrant populations and tons of crime
there's a residential tower in Spreitenbach, lovingly nicknamed "Blutwurst" (blood sausage) because of its hideous crimson color and the insane amount of assaults committed there
That castle and the view was amazing, never seen anything like it
Oh my god, that gave me a good laugh
But where did he go to get so ripped off
Oh no, in that case I feel very lucky that at least our airbnb had a normal toilet
Maybe you're not supposed to but I had diarrhoea my guy
Well, sometimes it just sneaks up when you're already out and can't go home
I as a woman had a real "oh shit" moment going to the toilet to pee just to discover that there was no toilet paper but only a hose thing
I can't really think of one
Are swiss people just too punctual
Haha me too
I work at the swiss federal railways (SBB) and we love saying, « shit SBB was late again » when we are late for work :D
Yes
I was about to say we just show up on time
I just chuckled when I saw the post, but I really can't think of anything
Well as they say: "Fünf minuten vor der Zeit ist des Schweizers Pünktlichkeit
" Basically saying swiss people are always five minutes early
Being from Vaud, I just invoke the "Quart d'heure vaudois" when I'm late
Everyone knows vaudois people are always 15min late to everything
We really are
They are, but we still use it as an excuse
They are generally on time, but are far from having Japanese precision
The rail network is much denser though, and it has to be shared with freight and international travel transiting through the country
Yeah that's one of few exeptions where it would be considered rude for us too
Finance/accounting department
Human Resources
Is the guy that never has fun, doesn‘t laugh at your jokes, but does all the work, but only for themselves
Only looks for themelves
Is wealthy for all the paid overtime he does
Never shows up to office parties
except for apéros
Oh yes
No, because I went on an exchange year to the US during high school and after I graduated I went back to live there for another 6 months
These stays have not only improved my English by magnitudes but they have also given me a completely American accent
In fact, when I went to live in South Korea a few years later where a lot of Americans go to teach English, many of them mistook me either for an American or a Canadian
The latter was actually a really good guess because I mainly lived in northern Pennsylvania, roughly 30 miles from the Canadian border
This is one of the fun things about doing these exchange years
When you're a teenager, your brain is still developing and you manage to soak up the specific pronunciations, the accent, the words and the grammar like a sponge
Also, you learn about the local culture and mentality and oftentimes, word choice is related to that
For example Americans do a lot of overstatement, while Brits do a lot of understatement
This transfers into the vocabulary
There are also some things that simply don't exist in one country or the other
Nowadays, at age 31, I'm too old (neurologically speaking) and I wouldn't be able to pick up on these things so well anymore
I see that with my mom who learned English at a later stage in life and uses a funny mix of British and American pronunciation and vocabulary
However, when I was a teenager, I was still able to do this
Absolutely, I use -our
But for other words I use the American spelling
i try to sound british (some kind of southern accent) and spell words the british way but sometimes i get confused which is which or i mess up my pronunciation
I tend to listen more to british english nowadays
I try to avoid american english if possible
idk if it’s actually a canadian thing or if i’m totally wrong but i’ve found that when people say things like
walkin instead of walking (it’s hard to type out what i mean) they’re usually canadian
To be fair even in Europe car rental companies segment their cars in a ridiculous manner
Yes a VW Polo IS technically a 5 seater, but it's not a big car
I lived in the US for nearly 6 years, and my first wife was an American
I would say I have experienced a lot of the US, including visiting all 50 states
Things that surprised me about the US:
Food and drink portions are gigantic
Swiss are famous for the love of cheese and putting cheese on and in things, but America takes that to another level
even if the cheese is less good tasting
They think they have Swiss cheese, but what they call Swiss like a really shit version of Ementaller cheese
They are surprised that we have like 400+ kinds of cheese, none of which we call Swiss
Americans are very aggressive drivers
Courtesy for fellow motorists seems to not exist
Everyone everywhere goes considerably over the posted speed limit, even when police are present
I never figured out what the rush was or the reason for the "me first" attitude when driving
Perfectly friendly people turn into raving lunatics behind the wheel
People wear shoes inside their homes
So strange
Coffee is a crime against humanity
I think of it as brown colored breakfast water
Don't get me started on chocolate and cheese
American breakfast is massive
Delicious, but too much food
Restaurants are always focused on rushing people in and out rather than the enjoyment of the guests
The country is vast and covers many different climates and biomes, yet it is also shockingly the same
One can be at the Wal-Mart in Juneau Alaska or Portland Maine and see the same products
The plazas contain the same stores, with only some regional variation
It is really weird how similar the feel of it all is
even when the people and landscape are different
Americans have weird race issues
People who live in the same town, have kids in the same school, like the same sports teams, and work in the same company can see themselves as more aligned with me as a white Swiss person than their neighbors that are black or hispanic
I never quite understood what drove the divide, as it seems to exist even with people who never seemed to be particularly racist to me
Time is a relative thing there
Swiss arrive when they are scheduled to do so
We wait outside for a party that starts at 7 pm, so we ring the door bell at 7
Not 8, or 6:45, precisely 7
We would rather stand outside in the rain than be early, or worse yet, late
We schedule everything, often a year in advance, and with great details
Americans see to just sort of "do stuff when they are ready". It is a big adjustment
In general, low price seems to be favored over high quality
A Swiss will spend 100 USD on a shovel and pass it on to his children, an American will buy a 10 USD shovel a dozen times in his life
Americans are shockingly open and friendly
It is terrifying at first
The generally are lovely, but I can see why they think we are cold
It took me years to understand things like small talk between strangers
Many times when I first arrived I thought people might be mentally ill, cult members, or trying to set me up for a crime
lol
Weird customs about flags, patriotism, and such seem odd to an outsider
Swiss people like flags, and they are not uncommon, but we seem to have much less formality around rules and such for them
Why is tax not included in prices
Why is it withheld from pay checks and not just collected in bulk once a year
Why do you buy cars from a lot filled with cars and not order them from the factory
The same for furniture
Anyway, that is 15, and I could go on for days
In general, I liked living there
I don't want to give the impression of just complaining
It was a positive time for me, although I was also happy to move back home to Switzerland
Is that why I've seen memes about "your balls touching the water" before ??
Can confirm, I’m American-born Swiss and I never got used to La Bise
I hate it so much and i foster a secret candle of gratitude to covid for eliminating it
Switzerland here, and I’ve also noticed how dry it has been, but no one is talking about it
At least we’ve established some fire bans
... yes
I don't know if they really are old timey but names like Gervais or Ambroise for men and Ursule or Germaine for women feel like old names
That's for the French speaking part of Switzerland
"Fridulin" and "Flurina"
Malwine, Gesine, Philine are my favourite old-times German names
My offspring is named Henriette and Gustav
Not too modern either
Oh no this brought up memories from when I was 13 and went into starbucks claiming my name was Edeltraut
We thought it was hilarious
The cringe
In swiss german id just say Joseph and all its shorts for males (Sepp , Pepi etc)
I think also Regula for women
My uncles are Raymond and Denis, both born in the 50s. I know a boy whose name is Odilo, but we found that weird and his family is German-speaking
Nicole and Chantal were really popular around 1990 in German-speaking Switzerland
It reminds me of the names the native americans had, or at least in comics and movies
Also Kurt, short for Jokurt or Jogurt
Heidi
By 2050
Bold of them to assume we're still alive then
US: climate change isn't real lmao
Brazil: let the trees burn
It never happened to me but something that does happen quiet often is that I forget how to say something in French and can't remember immediately
Sometimes I have to think for like ten whole seconds or try to describe what I'm trying to say to the person I'm talking to
The highest mountain in Switzerland is the Dufourspitze, named after Guillaume Henri Dufour who was the General in the Sonderbund war, the last war Switzerland ever had
The Swiss have the highest chocolate consumption rate in the world, with about 10,3 kg per capita/year
Switzerland basically has seven presidents
It’s governed by a council of seven people, that take decisions by voting
Every year one of them is elected president of the council and therefore President of the Confederetion, but they do not have more power than the six other counsellors
Even though the official name of the country is the Swiss Confederation, Switzerland isn’t a confederation but a federation
Rumantsch, the fourth national language, was only recognized as such in 1938 in an effort to furthermore distinguish Switzerland from its troublesome neighbors at the time
One of the countries with the highest quality of life and also one of the most expensive places to live in
There are 208 mountains over 3000m high – with 24 of them over 4000m. The highest is Monte Rosa (Dufourspitze) at 4634m, situated on the Swiss/Italian border
We have four national languages: German, French, Italian, and Romansh
In the German part of Switzerland, *Swiss Standard German* is used as the written form, but in conversation and in casual texts/emails we communicate in *Swiss German* dialect
Assisted suicide is legal (EXIT reports over 1200 assisted suicides in 2018)
The highest railway station in Europe is in Switzerland, on top of the Jungfraujoch at 3454 meters
We have four official languages, that are all spoken in different parts of Switzerland: German, French, Italian and Romansh
Swissgerman is like a really really wild dialect of German, most Germans have trouble understanding it
Swissgerman has tons of Swiss dialects aswell though
Some can even be really really hard to understand for natives of other regions (for example Walliserdütsch)
Swissgerman has no grammatical rules, so the official language is just German
Our flag, unlike almost all others, is not rectangular but square
We‘re rumoured to be crazy rich, because on paper our salaries look like A LOT
In truth most people are just normal earners, everything is just so much more expensive here that our high salaries and high expenses balance themselves
We‘re surrounded by the European union on all sides (except for Liechtenstein which is tiny and which most people view as some sort of
„half-Switzerland“), and have our own currency in a huge sea of „Euroland“ around us
This and the what I mentioned in 4
results in tons of Swiss people shopping in Germany for anything from cars to everyday household necessities
doesn't liechtenstein also match the first criteria
Man I wanna come study in Denmark
Official government documents are always written in German, French, and Italian
But when you see official signs in public places such as railway stations, they're written in the local language first with maybe one or two other national languages and sometimes also in English
[some examples]
oops, that comment was hidden for me
Still an impressive fact
As a swiss i also understood it to some degree
Loved it tbh
No global warming
Wow
And the Netherlands is one of those countries where the damage will be quite big to say the least
And still people deny it smh
Yeah but I think you also go to prison if you protest against climate change, right
> Or, does the evil EU = Jews
All the same for them: Globalists = EU = Jews
There grill me one a stork
This is the best thing I've read all day
Unfortunately don't have gold to give but I'll drink a pint to you
He a painter by any chance
Alles klar Österreich
Apparently Italian officials pay as much attention to their tunnels as they do their bridges
Edit : too soon
He hasn't found his passion yet
Let's see what the future brings
Hey, I tried to pay one once, but the ink on the fine literally smudged so I couldn't read the bank transfer information
I tried contacting them by email a few times but never heard back
Edit : thinking about it, it was actually a toll bill as they wouldn't accept my maestro card when I tried to pass the gate
So it was a private company that bumbled it up, not the authorities
Things are not going as planned, thats quite unthinkable for a lot of the swiss people
We are pretty arrogant and i think this crisis will help us get back to earth
Not having to go to work
Man, we are no where near as prepared or ready as we should be
And why aren't we testing more people
It's not like our gouvernement doesn't have the money
And why wasn't military aid engaged two weeks ago
The stereotype of us being slow is really taking shape
It’s not just that, but it seems many people just act like it’s not that bad
I had to go out today, in Lausanne there were people everywhere in town, just casually hanging out
It really looked like a regular Monday, not what I expected
Now our big plan to all retreat in our bunkers in the mountains in case of war seems just very unrealistic
People are retarded
The media and gouvernement have not been able to get through to them
It's frustrating
Not at all no
But it may be because I’ve been wanting to visit for quite some time now, so if anything I think about it maybe more than other European countries
Being in the EFTA together it might also come up a little more often in the news here
That being said, I don’t feel like I tend to forget about any country in Europe at all anyway
( citizen here) Yes, I will support any initiative to develop a better railway network across Europe
Hey I did the whole Sweden by train this year (actually Zürich-Hamburg-Kopenhagen-Luleå-Haparanda/Tornio-Kemi-Kolari-Helsinki-Stockholm-Gdansk-Warsaw-Zürich by trains and ferries)
That was a lot of fun
You're missing out
Traveling by train is the best way of traveling
Trains are not only much more environmental friendly than options you listed, they are also more safe and more comfortable
I wish Europe taxed airlines out of short-haul business and used that money to develop railway network
Please don't be offended, but that's more like a French problem than a railway problem
I made a mistake of booking a flight with a layover in Paris and guess what happened
100% agreed
i look for swiss comments and while scrolling always accidentally stop at the danish ones
How well can you relate to the Swiss comments
I remember in one of my first English lessons learning the words for furniture, and thinking they all sounded terrible and couldn’t believe they actually meant something; especially chair, wardrobe and furniture
Sausage
It sounds like sauce and just doesn't evoke the mental image of a Wurst
Idk this word just frustrates me

I remember in one of my first English lessons learning the words for furniture, and thinking they all sounded terrible and couldn’t believe they actually meant something; especially chair, wardrobe and furniture
Also the same meaning in French
I’ve just noticed, no idea what happened
Nah its not closer
In norwegian you pronounce it literally the same like in english
But we do also say Spanish to describe people—just only as an adjective
As a noun, it can only refer to the language
He is Spanish
He speaks Spanish
He is a Spaniard
Tbh, I don’t think I have ever called anyone a Spaniard before
It sounds really old-fashioned to me, like Don Quixote or something
I would probably say something like, “He’s Spanish, from Barcelona
not shorts but i wear t-shirts all year round, even when im skiing
To a degree, yes
Switzerland has a very complicated relationship towards Germany that can probably best be described as hate-love
This is particularly curious because Germans generally love Swiss people and every German I've met (both in Switzerland and abroad) has been super kind to me
I think the inconvenient truth is probably that Swiss people have a bit of an inferiority complex and the fact that literally hundreds of thousands of Germans have flocked into Switzerland during the past 20 years hasn't exactly made this easier
Our far-right party SVP actually proposed banning Germans from entering the country at one point
not in the way most people would think, but there is a kind of discontent towards Germans, similar to how walloons don't like the French
it's a general kind of "they see us as an extension of their country, so we don't like them" vibe
(not saying that Germans do)
My friends all for some reason do not like germans (theyre swiss) and when asked why, they give these same answers "Theyre unfriendly, humor-less" etc
But personally every german I met was very kind and I had fun talking to them
We basically "hate" the Germans as much as we "hate" the French
Actually, in Romandie we "hate" the French much more than the Germans
The swiss on the other side of the Röstigraben deal with the Germans, we handle the French
Honestly don't know what the swiss across the alps think of Italy though
> the fact that literally hundreds of thousands of Germans have flocked into Switzerland during the past 20 years hasn't exactly made this easier
I think the job market plays a big role in this relationship
This Germany-Switzerland relationship is only true for the north-eastern cantons
For everybody else in Switzerland, Germany isn't any more a special neighbour than Italy, France or Austria
Well, the joke here goes: the Habsburgs originated from the still existing [Habsburg] so their true ancestry is Swiss ;)
^(This of course completely ignores the fact that the Habsburg was not on Swiss territory back then
That happens to anybody who doesn't have the license plates of the canton they're in, tbh
Lol I'm very sorry about that
Unfortunately, it's only too well imaginable
Here in the french speaking region we love to hate on France, like teasing a sibling you know ? I definitely feel a closer connection to France than any other neighbour of ours, and I feel like it’s the same for the Swiss-germans and Germany
Lol I completely have to agree with you about the Eastern European thing, even though it might upset some people here
As for the "unfriendly" part
this sentiment (in Switzerland) is actually the result of an unfortunate cultural misunderstanding
A lot of Germans who come to live in Switzerland arrive here with very little prior knowledge of what the culture and *mentality* are like
Somewhat ignorantly, they usually assume that it's basically the same as back home, just that everything's a bit smaller
I can understand why they would make this assumption but unfortunately for them, it is very wrong
As many Germans have to find out as they begin to live here, Swiss culture and especially Swiss mentality can be quite different from German mentality
One great example for this is communication
Germans are known for their very direct and straight-forward style of communicating
To be clear, I'm not putting any value judgment on this, I'm just pointing it out
Meanwhile, Swiss people communicate extremely indirectly; to the point where even my Korean wife sometimes complains that Swiss people act too "Japanese", aka too indirect
Contrary to German people who simply tell you what's up, Swiss communication is built on a ton of detours, conditionals, politeness markers etc
The aim is to make the other person feel as comfortable as possible and to avoid conflict at all costs
For listeners, meanwhile, this means that they often have to read between the lines to understand what is actually being said
Just a few days ago, my wife told me about a situation at her job where her German boss wanted to take on extra work for the group and one of her Swiss colleagues tried to explain why this isn't possible
What the colleague actually meant to say was that the group is currently overworked with other projects but instead of saying this, she went on a long, meandering explanation about financial resources etc
A Swiss boss would've probably guess what she's *really* trying to say but the German boss instead answered after 10-15 minutes: "Alles klar, du überlegst es dir also noch
" This showed how she completely misread the situation
She interpreted the Swiss employee's lengthy explanation as a sign of uncertainty, when in reality, it was a very polite way of saying "no, we can't do that right now
The irony of this situation was that the German boss probably would've been 100% cool with a straight-forward answer
She may even have *preferred* such an answer
But the Swiss employee was not able to provide such an answer
They were both stuck in their culture's perspectives
Oftentimes, freshly immigrated Germans make remarks towards their Swiss coworkers or friends (or even strangers) that are viewed as extremely rude by these Swiss people
In reality, the Germans almost never intend to be rude
It's just the way they're used to talk to people from back home
Unfortunately, a lot of Swiss people don't realize these statements to be unfortunate faux-pas and instead they misinterpret them as unfriendly, rude, obnoxious etc
This is particularly unfortunate for the Germans because politeness is considered so important in Switzerland
So, that's where the "unfriendly"-stereotype comes from
Yes, but the Romandie's view of France is still more distant and reserved than how the north-eastern cantons view Germany
Nobody calls France the "big canton", or something of that sort
Idk Dutch tourists are my personal favorites when working as a server, they are direct but leave you for the most alone and don't try to be funny or make too many questions
Your hooligans on the other hand
I thought Bugatti was Italian until recently
And for some reason they have really weird add campaigns in Switzerland with a guy dressing up as a women(not that there is something wrong with that)
Asked my Japanese cousin what a Superdry jacket a stranger was wearing had written on it
Car
Gasoline
Tires
Racing
Likewise, all the Street Fighter moves are hilariously cheesy when translated literally
MOVING AIR PUNCH
TORNADO WHIRLING KICK
DRAGON PUNCH
Agreed, fuck Mateschitz
Wait til you find out that the Italian version tastes 100X better
Same, except I speak french and learning that those obviously french princesses weren’t french was just weird
> Yeah I mean maggi is synonymous with meaning instant noodles in South Asia
So you're telling me that a Swiss company is selling 90% of all instant noodles in southern asia, but i can't find any of these prodcuts in Switzerland ....
Yet funnily enough, here Milka isn’t really big I find
From a Swiss point of view it looks like a german knock-off of Swiss brands
For real
Ah makes sense then
I almost exclusively drink tap water and I think most people do this
Furthermore, when I am in another (European) country where tap is considered safe, I always drink a glass on arrival
It's kind of a ritual for me
It's actually common
I prefer personally water from the supermarket as I don't like the taste of our tap water
Because where I live the tap water comes from an area with many chalk in the ground/mountain and it gets the taste of it
But I don't mind if there's only tap water around
Here tap water is so good it's not only found in taps
You can actually drink from almost every fountain
Doesn't matter if in the city or on top of a mountain, you see a fountain thingy you can drink from it
If it's unsafe to drink there will be a sign (for example toilets on trains)
Yup, comes straight from the glaciers where I'm from
The only times I buy bottled water is if I want flavoured water
For sparkling water I use one of those soda stream things with tap water
My wife and I almost exclusively communicate in English because she comes from South Korea
Although her German is very good by now, we somehow never managed to switch over
After all, English was the language we spoke from the very beginning of our relationship, when she didn't know any German and I didn't know any Korean
Due to this, there are days when I do all of my talking in English and don't speak a single word of Swiss
It's even more common these days with Covid and both of us being home often
I also studied English at university, so there used to be days when I would talk in English to my wife, only to go to uni and continuing speaking English to other people, and come back home to my wife again
After many years of doing this, my brain is so set on English that I often forget about Swiss words and can only remember the English one
In fact, what's more extreme is that oftentimes when I do talk in Swiss to my family or a friend, an English word or phrase slips out before I consciously notice it
This happens especially when I'm very animated about a topic and I talk quite fast
Just the other day, I was talking to my doctor when I accidentally said "y'know" and just a few moments later "basically". These are classic brain farts; I don't deliberately throw these words into my Swiss conversations because I want to sound cool
In fact, it can be quite embarrassing when the person doesn't know me well and doesn't know my backstory
I've had some people give me stares because they probably thought I wanted to show off or be some sort of hipster
In reality, I simply can't help it
My brain gets confused constantly switching between 2 languages, so these things just slip out
It's even worse for my wife who on some days switches back and forth between 3 languages, for example when she talks to me in English, to people at work in German and to her friends back home on the phone in Korean
My wife and I both do a lot of code-switching (as it is correctly called in linguistics)
Sometimes I also can't think of an English word and randomly throw in a German one
What's particularly fascinating to me from a linguistic standpoint is that we seem to have certain languages allocated to certain themes or word classes
For example we use a lot of Korean words to express feelings and physical sensations (being sleepy, hungry, happy, sad, annoyed etc)
We often use Swiss or German for nouns
I haven't quite figured out why we do this and whether it's just us or whether it says something about those languages but it's an interesting phenomenon in my opinion
It usually happens when talking about a specific topic I learned about in English because I never heard the German words to begin with
This is pretty much the same in reverse
I suppose it would be the same with French but I usually don't really learn about things in French
flushing the toilet after 10pm if you live in a appartment(it was even written in our contract)
mowing the lawn on a sunday, someone(only swiss) will call the police
Same here but only in rural areas
In the city everyone will stare at you
It seems that it’s unacceptable in most cold countries
Youre all Swabians to us
Huere sau schwabe
The first one is so relatable
It's even worse for us since most people that guess your nationality when they hear you speak german go from biggest to smalles so it's always Germany -> Austria -> Switzerland
Literally the Nr
1 reason our Nation exists is that we didn't want to be  part of any of our neighbouring countries
You got the beer
We got the chocolate
Deal
My pulse just went up to 200 for a split second, so
well done :-D
I mean ill say it swiss german so we will see
I guess monarchs
But thats quite a stretch of swiss history
I mean it's still German
If you understand it you definitly know that it's German
But to German speaking folks it sounds weird
chuchichäschtli
I'm by no means a historian, but I'm pretty sure both Romansh and Ladino developed from the spoken Latin used during the time of the Roman Empire
Over the centuries they became less and less important and got replaced by older versions of German, French and Italian and are nowadays only found in some smaller regions
It's quite interesting, because without the Government trying to keep it alive (which they do for Romansh), it would most likely vanish completely in the next dozen generations or so
It's funny how you struggle with Bavarian and it's fairly understandable for most german speaking Swiss
As said its a big stretch especially regarding swiss history aswell
According to UNICEF, Switzerland was ranked the least family friendly country in Europe
Nah, the Burgundians and Savoyards are pretty chill about it
Yeah any war that involved Switzerland happened way too long ago for anyone in their right mind to care about
Like in Geneva they still celebrate their victory against the Savoyards back in 1602 in a tradition called "L’Escalade", but I’ve never seen a french person take it personally, that would just be weird
Could be discussed really
Raclette is apparently from the 1300s (source: Wikipedia), and at that time Savoy was much bigger, holding parts of modern-day western Switzerland
So Raclette is from Savoy, from a territory that is today divided between France and Switzerland, I suppose
(Username checks out)
No, I’m pretty convinced cheese fondue is more of a swiss thing
I’ll try my best;
For fondue you put lots of cheese in some kind of bowl, melt it, and then you eat it by sticking a peace of bread on the end of a stick, and putting the bread in the cheese
Image:  . We often eat pickles and tea with it
For raclette, there’s different ways of cooking it
My way is buying a pack of sliced cheese, then putting the cheese on a mini-frying pan (from a raclette kit, or whatever you call it), waiting until the cheese melts then put the melted cheese on a potato
We often eat ham etc (“charcuterie”, I have no clue how to say that in English
Image:
Who denies this
This is taught in history lessons here in Switzerland
Our Government decided to stop accepting any refugees in 1942 since they feared a german invasion if they kept accepting more Jews and Gypsies
I alwasy thought bad about this especially since my great-grandmother was a refugee who fled Germany before WW2 when Hitler rose to power
I wish they had the balls to accept refugees too, but saying our Government denies this to this day is simply not true
What you are referring to are the court cases probably
I know about some kind of fondue with meat, but it is more like cheese fondue: you put the meat at the end of a stick, put it in a kind of bowl, and let it boil for a while
(Fondue bourguignonne)
We use our kit maybe four, five times a year at most, and only for melting cheese, so I understand your surprise
But I don’t have any answers to your question unfortunately, we could just as well go without a raclette kit that you may consider as a wasted investment
But I definitely don’t regret it, I had such great raclette nights with friends, I think winter wouldn’t really feel like winter for me without a raclette
If any of the diet and weather comments were true switzerland wouldnt be anywhere near these countries, which it is
I feel like the work ethic in some jobs here could easily give people burnouts or heart attacks
Only if it's above the limit where it goes to court (25km/h iirc)
Again, god bless America
We have something called Maturastreich and its a whole event the last grade of our Highschool(Gymnasium/Kantonsschule) can plan and mess with the teachers and students, even the principale
We do
On our last official school week before our secondary education graduation exams we do all sorts of weird stuff
That includes some sort of over the top dress code every day, riding around with kick scooters and shooting others with water guns (although that's now restricted inside the hallways for obvious reasons)
During this week we also have the "Maturagag" (matura being the exit exam) which is a show organised by the graduating classes where some students are teamed up with teachers to complete disciplines like bobby car racing and other quite hilarious stuff
To top it all off there is the LSD ("Last School Day") where everyone is just partying around, dressing up crazily and all that stuff
Bare in mind that all of that happens before the exams even start lol
The Matura is the exam you do at the end of Highschool comparable to the German Abitur
I was thinking of Die Hard as well
The other guys are Georgian, so to me it'd make sense that they sound different
Granted I don't speak the language, so maybe it should be more similar to standard Russian
most definitely
in villages and on the countryside you always greet another
less so in cities or crowded places
Of course, it goes like "zi" - "zi"
(because it's just "Grüezi" but especially when hiking that "Grüe" often gets replaced by a breath)
Yes
And even one step further, dont use the formal greeting, use the informal one
In the mountains there's no need to be formal, everybody is your friend
(Just a short hello while passing, not stopping and talking for 5mins of course)
I have never heard the „1000m rule“ even tho I practically grew up nex to the austrian border (and in the mountains)
How cool
Idk if it‘s valid over here, Swiss people are pretty reserved
I‘d hope it was thogh, it‘s a very cool rule
Came here to say this
And we don‘t just use this on mountains, in the smaller villages it is common practise to say „Grüezi“ (or, just „zi“, accompanied by a minimal nod) whenever you meet someone/pass someone by, even if you happen to pass each other by on the town square
This is only valid for one on one or small groups meeting (like a group of friends passing by a family or sth like that), as soon as there are larger groups of people greeting is only necessary when you meet sbdy you know
But not greeting sbdy you pass by on an empty vilage road is regarded as rude
Source: Grew by up in a village, got reprimanded by my parents for not greeting
Whenever I hike outside of Switzerland, I need to keep reminding myself that I should say "hi" or a local equivalent and not "Grüezi".
But then for words like "Hi", "Thank you", "sorry" the tone and facial expression are more important than the language, so maybe it doesn't really matter
Not only in small villages
In Thalwil (pop 20k suburb of Zürich) everyone does that
My observation is that you say "Grüezi" if you pass by at most one person per minute
That‘s fair, I think you are right
I‘d say your rule applies eveywhere except maybe the actual cities, partly bc there you usually just pass too many people
Idk
the villager in me would also want to say „Grüezi“ if I met another lone soul alone at Zürich Central
Paying supermarket cashiers 20-25 CHF an hour (Around 18-23 EUR)
Schöni Wiehnachte
Wait so
if you say "splitting costs", are you talking about splitting them evenly or everyone paying the exact amount for which they ate
For example in a group of 5 friends every person pays 20% or every person pays the exact amount they owe
In (French speaking) Switzerland we refer to a "douche portugaise" (Portuguese shower) on the same way
I think something being glossed over here is suspension of all elections and referendums while the order is in effect, except the order has no expiration
Effectively he rules by decree and cannot by removed by election while he rules by decree
Kind of a tough situation to be in as a Hungarian, because as long as Orban rules by decree, you effectively do NOT live in a democracy, and who knows how long Orban will choose to make that last
[This] CNN article is where I understood there to be no elections, though a different article did say he could cancel them if he wanted
Is there something I'm missing here
I understand
I've got a similar problem with U.S. media whenever they exaggerate something Trump did, it just adds more fuel to the "fake news" fire
There's already enough shit you can call Trump on, there's no need to make anything up
Gopfeseckel etz hörsch aber
I speak Solothurnisch/Berndeutsch and my friend from München (has only been once in Switzerland) understands me just fine
Random question but: Is it just me or does Torbjörn from Overwatch not really have a swedish accent
I've never heard any swedish People talk with his accent before
It's def easier to read
I think a main hurdle is how much we merge words: e.g. the phrase "kannst du mir"/"kannste mir" is simply abbreviated to "chaschmr" (yes, not even a schwa)
The singular-formal version in Western dialects would be "chötdrmr" -- "könnt Ihr mir", although in the Eastern and Basel dialects it would be something more discernible like "chönnt si m(ə)r" -- "können Sie mir".
Pronouns in general are often hidden in word endings like that
We also simplify some other propositions/articles, like "das" becomes "z" or "die" -> "d", "an der" -> "ar".  I guess these can be overheard by non-trained speakers
The latter is especially interesting because in standard German the final R becomes (nearly) a vocal sound, whereas in Swiss German it's a very hard R -- the connection isn't immediately clear in spoken speech
Another curiosity is how word-initial "gg" is an actual sound here
"ggsee" (gesehen, saw) and "gsee" (sehen, seeing) are two different words
These shortenings are the main reason why a Swiss German sentence doesn't map 1:1 to a Standard German one, even if none of the words are different
I was told you have to learn to not become a garbage man
Even though it is absolutely essential
Don‘t judge people by their profession, judge them by their behavior
In North America, garbage workers are paid more than teachers
I love the fact that PlayMobil has a [garbage truck] in their line up
This is so wholesome
I wish you both only the very best
What even is the "académie français"?
I just wanted to say "Nénufar" shouldn't have been accepted AT ALL
And that's when my respect for these old people went down the drain
This being put aside, they kinda look like ""stylish"" government people, I can get why people would think that, if they didn't know what they are supposed to do ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Thats so stupid
It is clearly serbian gangsters who abduct people not albanian ones
I relate to this, having multiple languages seem to really confuse foreigners
One time in Geneva a guy asked me if I spoke spanish because we speak so many languages in Switzerland
that’s not how it works
Pretty sure I wouldn't survive summer without white wine and beer so I totally agree
>Eine allgemeine Impfpflicht ist mit dem Gesetz aber nicht verbunden
Ungeimpfte Kinder können auch nicht von der Schule ausgeschlossen werden
- tagesanzeiger
Seems like they will still be able to attend school as long as they pay the fine
While 2500 Euros sure is a hefty fine, I can see some entitled parents paying this so their kids can still attend school
Was not expecting that
Had an out loud chuckle at this :D
Sounds like they wanted an aggressively masculine rebranding of what used to be called a “fanny pack
And I think that’s beautiful
Even though we had a lot of rain and thunderstorms last night, it's still super hot
I get that we're almost in July but it could be a bit colder, i'm sweating constantly
I definitely regretted walking in the sun to avoid taking public transport the other day
Thankfully so far the nights are still below 20°C so it’s pretty comfortable
As long as I avoid direct sunlight, I’m actually enjoying this weather
I think i'll be fine haha just not a hot weather type of person
Oh god, I dread the nights where it doesn‘t go below 20°C.
I heard the same about Switzerland multiple times
And many kids learn how to ski at a very young age
The joke told is that kids learn to ski before the can walk
Unrelated but my grandmother once won a set of silver cutlery in a rabbit breeding contest
I grew up in her house so I've literally had a silver spoon in my mouth for al long as I can remember lol
That's actually a good question, because I feel like an outsider when visiting the French or Italian part of Switzerland
Sometimes feels like i'm not even in the same country
But it's a bit different for me since, although I was born here and grew up here, my parents are both Portuguese so that also comes into play
But I would still say that I just feel Swiss
Not being able to understand one or two national languages is just part of growing up here lol
As Swiss citizen my first "allegiance" is to my home canton
within Switzerland I'm "Bernerin / Bärnerin" (citizen of Bern) first, Swiss second
The same applies to the language
It's "Berndeutsch / Bärndütsch" for me, not "Swiss German", bcs it's my dialect
"I use the term "Swiss-German" only with foreigners
Abroad, I'm Swiss (even with my dual citizenship)
No chance explaining to foreigners that I feel more comfortable calling myself "Bernerin" than Swiss
I believe most Swiss feel like that
Switzerland might be a small country but it is a confederarion and a nation of will
The modern state only exists since 1848 and this only as a result of Napoleon reshaping Europe (which I think had been necessary)
But it can't erase hundreds of years of  independence
There are no Swiss inside of Switzerland
There are only Lausanners, Genèvans, Fribourgers, Berners, Valaisans, Lucerners, and so on and so forth
Swiss here
I mostly feel like a European
I could never imagine feeling German
That's just not who I am, and I don't even speak German
I do feel Swiss, but in practise I only feel Swiss when I'm in the German speaking part of the country
i feel swiss and i think les romandes aussi
Naaah I feel Swiss, but I always mention I'm from Tessin (Italian speaking region)
Still I also speak quite good french and German so I don't have communication problems with other swizzies
People in Switzerland (especially in Tessin) need to do an additional effort and properly learn at least another national language, otherwise sometimes we look like dumbasses who can't communicate and need to fallback to English
About Italy; I do not feel closer to Italian people
I feel closer to the Swiss-Germans and the Graubündern (Swiss-German / rumantsch):  we have similar habits, point of views ecc
As soon as you cross the border from Tessin to Italy, everything is so different
You see that they are not the same country and people are so different despite speaking the same language
PS: just so you know Tessinern are a very proud population
They get very offended if you call them Italians
&#x200B;
Also, funny thing: I was born in Croatia from a Bosnian-Croat father and a Serbian-Bosnian mother
When I explain my origins I just say Bosnia lol, but also I never really identified with that culture down there except for the communal part of it
That's something you hardly find in Switzerland
You know the feeling of having a little brother/sister that you don't have that much in common with in everyday life
In the end they're still family and you are still happy to visit, spend time with them and are proud of their achievements
Even if they might be different in some things or have completely different opinions, you like them nevertheless
This is how I feel about other parts of Switzerland
Not only other language parts, but all other parts than the few small villages I grew up in
Those villages will forever be where I'm truly from, just like your parents always stay your parents
And all the other parts of Switzerland are like little siblings to me, we're family
And Europe is like the weird aunt that wants to convert you to veganism but you only see her on special holidays so don't worry about her too much, you can ignore her for most of the year and be just fine
I was born in Germany and grew up in Switzerland
I don't feel like either of them but the actual Swiss people in Switzerland do feel Swiss
But someone from the German part of Switzerland doesn't feel like part of the French part and vice versa
>Sometimes feels like i'm not even in the same country
Same
Just feels like a different country where my mobile plan works, and I recognize the stores (Coop, Migros, UBS, etc)
It's interesting because I watched a Switzerland v. Ireland World Cup qualifier in Geneve, and no one knew the lyrics to the National Anthem
I mean, the majority of the Portuguese population in Switzerland lives in Romandie (largest being in Vaud, with 40'000, 5% of the canton's total population), so I'm not sure on how that would make you feel more of an outsider here than in Germanic Switzerland
But I'm not in your situation or have your life experiences, so I'll take your word on it :)
Personally, when I go to Germanic Switzerland, I still feel at home, but like, different ? I think the best way to illustrate my feeling would be like a full life city guy going to farming country, or a valley in the mountains
Still home, but a bizzaro version of home
I would say that (as a non-native who is doing her best to integrate), I feel "Swiss German" (is that even a thing
), and then Swiss
I say this because once I cross that Röstigraben, I no longer feel quite so connected to my countrymen
But yet I feel closer to them than if I just crossed the border into France
yup
i consider myself swiss in general (like an umbrella term sort of) but in Switzerland i’m from my canton
I dont think thats a majority opinion here
Meh, Swiss for me
We're a bit too different with things like the EU for us to say we're European in my opinion
I don't think that's what OP meant
In the title I'm pretty sure s/he meant "German-speaking Swiss", emphasis on the hyphen
Not knowing the lyrics of the national anthem unites the swiss of all language regions
I feel plenty at home all over switzerland, especially when compared to visiting a neighbour country
I think there's also a difference between going to a 'German' city that's in a bilangue canton (eg
Bern) or a city that can't be further from the Romandie (idk, Zürich
Gallen
While I barely speak French and understand only the basics, I interact with Welsche almost on a daily Basis (live in Bern)
Not from Ticino but I think most Swiss-<blank> have affinities towards their language <country> when it comes to random things
Like I found out a lot of Swiss Germans support the German National team in the World Cup, Swiss-Italians Italy, and Swiss-French France
Geneva was buzzing with French support during the most recent World Cup/Euros for example
You'd have to ask someone from Ticino ... Language-wise, there's barely any difference, but I don't know if there's big differences in culture between Ticino and Italy
I think they also feel more Swiss than Italian, but it'd be still interesting to know
No I agree with you
While I might have more in common with you culture and language wise, I would probably go to war with you the moment you attack any of my fellow countrymen, roman or ticinese
Iu, ds hani ou scho so erläbt
It's one country, but it's a federation of cantons, similar to the USA
I guess it can very loosely be compared to how Scotland, Wales and England together form Britain
The head of government is a council of seven called the Federal Council
They take decisions together
There is no single person like the British PM
There is a president of the council but he or she has no more powers than the others, it's mostly so presidents from other countries can meet with someone called president as well
Definitely not in the countryside but I think it's not that uncommon in Zurich, Berne, Geneva, Basel
My life is more similar to someone's who lives in any other European city than someone's who lives 15km far away in a suburb
The fact that we're not in the EU doesn't really come up in daily life
Nevertheless, that's probably also why I really see the benefit of getting closer to the EU
I understood it as in culturally close to the Germans
Guess I worded it weirdly
Yeah, speaking another language for me doesn't mean we're from different countries
Even the German dialects aren't the same and we still group them all together as if the Swiss German part was one homogeneous region
Also about the anthem thing, our anthem isn't as present in our daily lifes as it is in other countries
Among other reasons, national Symbols are important especially for big countries that depend on them to assure national unity
The US is a prime example for this
Switzerland feeds it's patriotism in different ways, but at the same time it puts a lot of emphasis on regional autonomy
Yeah I definitely feel Swiss
Of course I feel closer to other french speakers than german/italian/rumantsch, simply because we mix more for work, studies, etc
We’re divided into cantons, but there is no superior administrative entity we could identify with that would rule over each languages as a whole
I think in that sense that the language barrier is more superficial than anything
To give some context to others, our national anthem is widely disliked because we feel its ultra-pious content is exceedingly awkward and doesn't fit our modern character any longer (didn't even when it was adopted)
We even held multiple contests the last couple decades to select a new anthem
South African anthem is my favorite one for this reason
Always get goosebumps when they sing it before big Rugby matches
It's a common name for supermarket chain because they are supposed to work according to a cooperative scheme (not an economist, don't know the specifics)
But they are not all the same company across Europe
I must have lived in the wrong Switzerland in all those years
I have not met one swiss german who supports the German Nation team
As a guy with dual citizenship I was bullied for supporting Germany
They were supporting Paraguay if they ever played against Germany
Geneva is special because its considered to be basically French by the rest of Switzerland
I too wouldn't answer "Europe" because while I prefer it, that is more of a romantic/philosophical answer and they probably wouldn't expect such an answer, but more a matter-of-fact place of origin one
Could be because more people in larger cities have a European double citizenship
I... I just never heard it and disliked it when I did
So yeah, fuck the anthem ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
Over Switzerland, no they don't. But in my experience, they absolutely do root for Germany
I'm also talking the general world of sports
Like loads of Ligue 1 fans in Geneva, and I know loads of Bundesliga team fans in the Swiss German sides
Yes Switzerland is a Willensnation
Its not really the nationality that binds us togheter but the will to stand up for our values
No war is always better and you could make the argument that we are kind of experts in that field
:D Didnt want to seem hostile either
The argument of beeing not a united nation is just something we dont like if people bring it up
Gadaffi even proposed to split our nation at one time
That probably helps
For me personally it's the fact that my life is more similar to someone's who lives in any other European city than someone's who lives 15km far away in a suburb
Yeah, that's what I meant with other ways of promoting patriotism
You might have noted that we have the bright red flag everywhere, but they're very often together with the cantonal flags
The national anthem, however, is pretty much non present
I honestly can't remember the last time I heard it
In other countries you sing it every morning in school while putting up the national flag
Also we might have all those flags around but they are mostly decor, no one does anything actively with them
There's a difference between having flags around and singing an anthem, the second one needs a more active participation
My comment was more to answer why most Swiss don't know the lyrics of our anthem
(also the flags are mostly seen on tourist spots
Yes Bundesliga fans I agree
Borussia Mönchengladbach has a huge following in Switzerland, but when it comes to international games I often felt a lot of hate towards their language brothers
But maybe thats because I grew up in a more conservative part of the country
Yeah unfortunately the average swiss is rather hostime towards anything proposed  by foreigners
But the dynamic is slowly changing
The nationalist party is loosing more and more elections because people realize that we can only stay "rich" if we coorporate with other countries
Switzerland really does have a weird history compared to other european countries
We were founded as a union, and still kinda are one, but dislike the new union that have formed in the last centurie
(Out of the perspective of an average swiss, not mine)
In Switzerland, being crazy is illegal

* Seemingly every time I entered a restaurant in Mallorca I was greeted in German
Yeah I know it's the 17th Bundesland or whatever, but apart from speaking fluent Spanish I am also of Asian descent and don't speak a lick of German, so I found that a bit odd
Not to mention I had a lot of elder German couples wanting to speak to me (in German) about who knows what
* Was at a hostel in Barcelona and befriended a really nice German dude that had MS (multiple sclerosis) and had to use a wheelchair
I'm out on the plaza drinking a beer when he comes up to me and asks me if I want to (pinches his thumb and pointer finger) "smoke". Sure
I'm game
Lo and behold this guy is going around asking others to join, but not like other tourists, like
"locals". Spent the night drinking, smoking, and talking to a group that included a paraplegic, a drug dealer, and two prostitutes
I think Jesus would be proud of the sight
* Wanted to get the scoop from locals as to where to eat in Firenze, so I asked a kind looking Italian man if he recommended a place to eat
Looks at me
Dead pan serious
"la casa di mia mamma
" And no he wasn't inviting us over, he was just postulating for who knows why
By the way, this isn't the first time I've heard that answer
A lot of Italians answer the same way
Maybe not that strange, but still a bit of a culture shock I guess
This summer I went to Stockholm with my mother
One evening we decided to go to the cinema
The movie was at 8pm, and –as it is normal in Switzerland– we arrived about 15 minutes earlier
The staff seemed very surprised to see us so early, and indeed we were the very first
We awkwardly waited alone in the hall for the 15 minutes, and even when we were in the room there was almost no one
The movie started about 20 minutes late and people casually started arriving only during that time
I’m certain we didn’t get the time wrong, so I wonder if it’s just a known thing in Sweden that movies don’t start at the scheduled time
I was on holiday with my parents in Paris when I was 7, an English kid dressed in my Sunday Best with a beret on (obviously, because France)
We went on a Bateau Mouche  to take in the sights and no sooner had we boarded the boat, a huge group of Japanese tourists started taking photos of and with me
My parents found it hilarious and just let them think I was a French child and carry on snapping away
I sometimes wonder where the pictures are now
Had a similar experience at an AibBNB in Germany
We knew it was just a room in a large house but assumed the adjoining bathroom was for our private use
The house was huge and the hosts had bathrooms in their own bedroom
Anyways I'm in the bathroom brushing my teeth and the host casually walks in and starts brushing his teeth next to me
Like dude
at least wait until I'm done
Will add more as I think of them:
* Found the nightlife in Lisboa to be fantastic around the Bairro Alto, but the drug dealers are a bit
extreme
(eye contact)
Marijuana
(shake my head no and walk away)
Cocaina
HEROINA
* Took a family trip to China and the tour bus stopped by a massage place
No big deal, we could use a massage
Except, as soon as you walk in there was a staircase (one of those long circular ones) with scantily clad Chinese women waiting
The hosts asked us to pick one and she would take you to the massage area
Wait
what kind of family friendly massage is this again
17 year old me was quite
intimidated
Anyways, the foot massage was ok, but super awkward
But at one point she just started punching my shins with both fists
Over and over and over again
I started laughing in pain/nervousness and she kept going at it harder
Not fun
But it did feel better when she stopped so that's that
Kasper the "extra friendly" ghost
When I was in Greece it was Russian for me
But I guess that could make sense
For Switzerland: Ctrl+c followed by Ctrl+v.
I was in Copenhagen and a random man passed by on his bike to the cheers of a small crowd
Apparently the prince
I dont really feel sorry for anyone really
I guess i kinda feel bad for more alpine regions that have just become more or less tourist villiages or are solely dependent on tourism :/
And of course ticino, but more because they have to indure loads of swiss german tourists lul
We had a civil war in 1847, with the conservative cantons splitting from the rest and then being defeated
On most votes on the constitution, like the general revision in 1999, you can still see the divide
In total, about 100 men died in that war
I would be surprised if anyone knew anything about our country history beside that we were neutral during ww I and II
As for a major event I would say the battle of Moorgarten (Schlacht am Moorgarten), which is considered the first battle between the Confederates and the Habsburg
According to historians,  there's a very good chance that The Battle of Moorgarten never actually happened and is mostly legend
Edit : I'd say the fact that Switzerland had a civil war over religion and government centralisation is a big one that no one knows about
Sonderbund War
Really cool game, haven‘t gotten around to play it lately
The general of the confederacy (*ironically not the seperating party*) told his soldiers not to use explosive ammunition, only conventional rounds, as they were firing at the same guys they went to bootcamp together sometimes
It lasted less than a month and there was only one or two „major“ battles
Yeah, there were neutral cantons
Yeah, Swiss mercenaries were contracted a lot outside of Switzerland
It is said that they suffered a lot from being away from home, though  Their intense nostalgia was know as the Swiss Disease (Schweizerkrankheit)
I think there's this anecdote where certain songs were forbidden in France as the nostalgia would overtake the soldiers stationed there and make them desert
But honestly I don't know how true all of this is
Swiss being mercenaries should be well known
Or have you never asked yourself why the [Pope has Swiss Guards]
Or from French history there is this little episode:
> The assault on the Palace began at eight o'clock in the morning
As per the King's orders, the Swiss troops had retired into the interior of the building, and the defense of the courtyard had been left to the National Guard
The Marseillais rushed in, fraternized with the gunners of the National Guard, reached the vestibule, ascended the grand staircase, and called on the Swiss Guard to surrender
"Surrender to the Nation
", shouted Westermann in German
"We should think ourselves dishonored
" was the reply
"We are Swiss, the Swiss do not part with their arms but with their lives
We think that we do not merit such an insult
If the regiment is no longer wanted, let it be legally discharged
But we will not leave our post, nor will we let our arms be taken from us
Stubborn until death
Yepp, that's completely plausible
The people back at home thought this was such a cool way to go that they made the [Lion Monument]
Jup, it's a common ocurrence in our history, like the whole Tell affair or how supposedly they named Bern after the first aninal they hunted
I'm pretty sure it was more than three times, we might as well be invading Liechtenstein accidentally again right now as we talk
The « Swiss army invading Liechtenstein and coming back with a friend »-story is just a funny story we like to tell
In fact the Swiss army ensures the sovereignty of Liechtenstein as well, and they often have to pass through there
It’s not a rarity that Swiss soldiers find themselves on Liechtenstein soil
Doesn’t really qualify as « invasion ». There have been some incidents where they mistakenly fired into Liechtenstein though
Yeah, you're right
I mean there are quite a few things that happened, like the national strike is something we study too, but internationally there's really not that much that's relevant
"Maybe an epic cavalry charge
"No that's too unrealistic"
"What if we threw trees down our mountains at them
"Brilliant
Write that down
You just get lost
There's even a [wikipedia article ] about this
The Rhein lies between both countries all along their border
The free hour of parking you get during lunch time
But it usually comes with ice in the U.S
Good point
I have to disappoint you: linguistically, there is no language in the world whose features are entirely unique, aside from a few individual words
Even the most rare and strange linguistic characteristics are shared by at least a few obscure languages
Romanian is no exception
For example the feature that you present here is very common in English as well
"Speed" and "velocity" mean the same thing, except that the former has Germanic roots whereas the latter has Romance roots
The same goes for "freedom" and "liberty" or "alive" and "animate" or "wrath" and "ire" etc
English has thousands of word pairs like that
Add *-li* in German-speaking Switzerland to make almost everything small (just *-i* if the word ends in *l*. But beware, there are pitfalls, most words require to change a preceding Vocal (Umlaut) and even add some other letters, as in
Chübel -> Chübeli (bin)Muus -> Müsli (that's not your English edible Müsli, it's a mouse, of normal or small size, resp
Mues -> Müesli (that's your Bicher-Müesli)Schoggi -> Schöggeli (chocolate, piece of chocolate)Maa -> Männli (man)
It's distinct from German *-lein/-chen*. You can't say *Schokoladelein* to mean a piece of chocolate (*Schokolädchen* might work though, but I doubt it would be mentioned in a conversation), whereas *Schöggeli* is perfectly valid
Grammar in swiss german doesnt exist, and there is no correct way of saying or writing something
Definitly not no other language, but Swiss German doesn't have an official written form, everything is written in German
And if we write in Swiss German we just write how we think it's correct
Well, in Swiss German we have the "ch" which is pronounced like you're choking and trying to get something out of your throat, but I think Arabic languages have that too, not sure though
Some French speakers do that too: a quick inhalation on the word “ouais
Wouldn’t that just be “-chen” or “-lein” in German
Or is the difference that anything can be diminutive in Dutch, but only some things can be diminutive in German
I can guarantee you that the Basque language is no exception to this
Languages are human products and since humans around the world are creative and a common trait of human languages is that they need to be constructed in logical ways, you will always find the same trait or characteristic in more than one language
I don't speak Basque but as someone who has studied linguistics, I could give you features that are probably far rarer than anything Basque possesses and yet, these features can be found in other languages
For example clicking sounds are a very rare feature among the roughly 6,000 languages spoken on Earth
Yet, there is an entire group of such languages called "bantu". One of them is Xhosa, another one is Ta'a. There's also a language spoken in Mexico where speakers are unable to use words like "left" or "right". They only use absolute (cardinal) directions such as "east" or "west". Rather than saying "you are standing to the left of me", these people would say "you are standing south-east to me". Now, this is an incredibly rare and odd linguistic feature but even this exists somewhere else, namely in a few aboriginal languages spoken in Australia
I think that decisions affecting public health should be approached by consulting science
Many scientific research communities and research societies  have publicly spoken out against permanent daylight-saving time (pDST) and in favor of standard time (ST, "wintertime")
From a joint statement of the European Sleep Research Society, European Biological Rhythms Society and the Society for Research on Biological Rhythms:
>We would like to emphasize that the scientific evidence presently available indicates that installing permanent Central European Time (CET, standard time or ‘wintertime’) is the best option for public health
The European Biological Rhythms Society further writes:
>ST improves our sleep (1) and will be healthier for our heart (2) and our weight (3)
The incidence of cancer will decrease (4), in addition to reduced alcohol- and tobacco consumption (5)
People will be psychologically healthier (6) and performance at school and work will improve (7)
The Society for Research on biological rhythms concludes:
>We therefore strongly support removing DST changes or removing permanent DST and having governing organizations choose permanent Standard Time for the health and safety of their citizens
The American Academy of Sleep Medicine further says:
>It is the position of the AASM that the U.S. should eliminate seasonal time changes in favor of a national, fixed, year-round time
Current evidence best supports the adoption of year-round standard time, which aligns best with human circadian biology and provides distinct benefits for public health and safety
There are some other aspects that politicians and citizens may also consider, e.g. safety, commercial activity or recreational activity, but science related to sleep and biological rhythms  - with a focus on public health - is pretty clear on that end
>I don't believe in this squabble about "natural" time
It's called science, you either accept it or deny it

You are not weird at all, the influence of natural light as a "zeitgeber" is well established in science
Scientific research communities in those areas are in favor of establishing permanent standard time ("Winter time") for exactly those reasons
So, people in here asking for summer time because they "enjoy more sun after work" are comparable to people who say that the like climate change because they enjoy walking around in shorts and flip flops all year round
They just ignore the problem at hand and the scientific evidence
>for a day but not in average for the week (which suggest that people who would have gotten a heart attack anyways just got it a few days earlier)
i) that still indicates that changing to summertime puts the body under stress
ii) the same studies also show that the risk of heart attacks drops after the change back to standard time in winter, indicating that the body never fully adapted to summertime
iii) it's about the mismatch of the circadian clock and social clock
Our body never fully adapts to summertime, e.g. cortisol metabolism has been shown to adapt by only 2 minutes instead of 60 minutes, leaving the body under constant stress
You are right, this isn't rocket science if people would care to read up about the topic before they comment
So, are you arguing to start schools eg at 9
00 instead of 8
00 and at the same time to move clocks forward from 8
00 to 9
You would cancel out any positive effect a later start of school and work day would have
You are missing the point: *even if* the weekly heart attacks wouldn't change overall, the results show that the body reacts to subtle changes on clock time, e.g. by disrupting sleep quality, which can lead to negative health outcomes
Furthermore, Sleep quality remains adversely affected during summertime, this has been shown again and again, e.g. more "social jet-lag" in summertime
Social jet-lag has been connected to adverse health effects
That being said, other studies show higher heart attack risk after change to DST for the full week (and lower risk after change back to standard time)
"Start's much too early" - but at the same time, you support summertime
It's tough to have a meaningful discussion with someone who doesn't seem to understand the absurdity of those two positions in connection to each other
No, it's you who doesn't understand the study
Cortisol peak levels were *later* by 58 minutes, referring to clock time, so e.g. at 7:58 summertime vs
7:00 standard time
7:58 summertime corresponds to 6:58 standard time
Hence, the body adapted by 2 minutes
If the body would have adapted by 58 minutes, cortisol peak levels would be at 7
02 summertime, which corresponds to 6
02 standard time
They even explicitly mention in the study how they showed that the time of sunrise and not clock or awakening times is the determining factor for cortisol levels
>For half a year: yes
For the other half year the time doesn't change so the effect is positive
That depends on what system we are talking about: If we talk about permanent summertime, then it would be the same in one half of the year and worse in the other compared to the current system
If we talk about the current system, where we keep switching between standard time and summertime, then yes it would be the same during summertime and better in winter
However, the best option would still be to use permanent standard time ("wintertime"), as then it would be better all year round
Additionally, there is evidence that the body never adapts to the time change during the months of summertime, e.g. in Australia during a permanent summer time trial the cortisol levels adjusted for 2 minutes, instead of a full hour
Cortisol levels are involved in the wake response and are thought to prepare the body for energy consumption and stress
Furthermore, studies have shown the connection of (permanent) summertime and the phenomenon "social jetlag" and the connection of "social jetlag" and depression and seasonal mood changes
But I'm definitely not going to start discussing anecdotal evidence, that's not science but personal opinions
I just used that time as an example
There is no standard starting time, as there is no unified school system in Switzerland, rather various regional systems
In my case, and this is a few years back, starting time would usually be between 7
30 to 8
00, depending on which level of school
>And yes, it's anecdotal, but most people I know prefer summer time
The funny thing is that many people say that - until they experience permanent summertime in winter:
e.g. in the US there was one year of permanent summertime in the 70ies
Initially, the support was around 80%, after the first winter that support dropped to 40%. Similarly, in different Australian states, there were a few trial periods of permanent summertime (of 3 years) with a subsequent vote
Voters defeated permanent summertime after the trial periods
Similarly, Russia adopted permanent summertime for a few years
The idea was initially well-received, however, after experiencing permanent summertime for a couple of years, public support dropped to less than a third
The decision was subsequently reversed
In any case, I don't care that you don't care about the average citizen
However, I do think that politicians should base their decision by consulting with science and if they would were/are to ask people they should accurately inform them on the topic
during the religious wars in France, we gave refuge to a lot of the hugenots (French protestants who were being persecuted), which is actually how the watchmaking industry came to Switzerland
I wish I could say the same for mine
I'm not sure, to be honest
not all of them were, perhaps it's coincidental
There's so many to choose from, I'd say either Paris or London, but preferably London
I think I didn't see a single car in Naples that wasn't duct taped in one place or another
The car that got us from the Airport just had mirror pieces stuck to the side view mirror with double sided tape
Yeah, those tiny steep little alleys where you almost get run over because cars drive through them even though they almost touch the walls with their mirrors
>1980's West/East Berlin
Oh wow didn't even think of a setting in a different time period, would be super dope
Oh god haha this would actually be hilarious

Water
Guys, there are fountains everywhere, please stop paying for bottled water
We don't really have any tourist traps here, not any that I know of
Edit: Okay, there are much more than I thought, I really haven't been around here that much apparently :/ Sorry guys
Zermatt (not that it isn't great but it's expensive, and well yeah the Matterhorn buuuuuut)
Lauterbrunnen/Jungfraujoch, maybe even the town of lucerne
Lucerne has a problem that big coaches full of asian tourist groups drive into town and storm the watch stores
I mean it brings lots of money, but the busses are a pain in the ass
They go walking by the Quai, want to see the lion monument and take the cablecaar to mount pilatus
Some of them even take a steam boat trip around the lake
Even the infoboards around town are written in chinese
Once the city locked a small proportion of the town around the coach-hub, because some swiss company invited 10'000 Chinese partners to lucerne, so for a week, there were even more than the average amount of tourists, which is already a lot
The interesting thing is, that the asians are already alot, but there's also a lot of americans and british, which you don't even recognize
The Arabians and indians mostly travel with their families, but they also spend insane amounts on the "most swiss things", like the asians (mostly chinese)
And for Jungfraujoch, the tickets to get up there are really expensive, even for swiss people
I think normally they start at about 80$, which is the early bird special
Normal tickets sale for around 100-150$. And then there's a restaurant on top where you can eat fondue which i didn't look up, but i guess it costs a fortune
It's also mostly big asian groups that the locals can profit off
They also travel in the coaches and do some sort of "Switzerland in a week" tour
They are mostly fairly rich people
While I agree that Florence and Siena are nicer, I find really weird saying that Pisa presents no interest outside of the cathedral area
I found it a charming city, although being married to a Florentine I should add : "Pisa merda".
Some restaurant definitely use the excuse of 'Switzerland is so expensive' to inflate their prices even more
Same for gift shops and other tourist attractions
Hate to say it but Lucerne really had  a tourist-trap feel to it the last time I was there
Overcrowded and all the shops selling overpriced, stereotypical Swissness
Love the Verkehrsmuseum, though
if you have enough money then absolutely visit the Jungfrau Region but if you’re on a tighter Budget i recommend going to every else except Zermatt
Yeah I went to eat there on my first evening in Copenhagen and thought the prices were reasonable
Yeah i wanted to go there this summer, but i guess thats not going to happen
I love chocolate and have a deep hatred for people who are late
Yes, the S-Bahn being late 3 minutes pisses me off
Spy movies have many scenes in Switzerland and usually it’s pure nature (not a single valley is uninhabited), a lonely castle (castles are usually amidst or close to a village) or old chalet in the mountains, comically traditional locals (Swiss people are normal)
Throw in a secret vault with gold here and there
Oh damn I want to watch this so hard right now
Or [that scene] in The Wolf of Wall Street
I’m fairly certain there isn’t a single building in Geneva that has such a view
It looks more like they’re on top of the Cathedral’s spire, or just straight up flying on a plane above the city
Yeah it looks like they put in an aerial view of Geneva
There is no building that tall there
Met quite a few Swiss people (and different ones at that) that have shared a theory that there are little/no "terrorist attacks" in Switzerland because the people who usually finance these attacks all have their money in Swiss banks
The the Swiss built CERN to communicate with the devil/hell/trans-dimensional demons, and that the Gotthard Base Tunnel is a portal we are building to release them from hell into our world
Why, you ask
Well because we are trying to build a new nazi empire with the help of the IMF, UN, Rothschilds, NASCAR, The Russians, FIFA, etc
, and the easiest way for a small country to take over the world is to clearly use demons
To be fair, I visited Canton Uri a few weeks ago and they have quite the obsession with Satan building public infrastructure for them
Lucky for us, they were "clever" enough to tricking the devil into building them an impossible bridge
So there's that
It would be much cheaper and quicker just to send all the university sport teams to an island with free booze for a week
We sometimes joke about conquering Lichtenstein
Not because we would like to, but because our great military keeps wandering into Lichtenstein territory "by accident".
Not necessarily reconquering, but we joke (or maybe not) about Liechtenstein already being the 27th canton
Not really no, but it might be because we haven’t lost our conquered territories
(Yes that is one way of seeing it)
we joke about reconquering valtellina and annexing haute Savoie, which we claimed in the Congress of Vienna but didn't get
We often joke about annexing Liechtenstein
I mean we invaded them by accident a few times already but the jokes are usually like "let's send half the police force of that really small town and let's conquer Liechtenstein". They're basically a part of Switzerland anyways like they were our little bro
Look we kicked you out many centuries ago, you're not fucking with us on this one
Interestingly, the original seat of the House of Habsburg is Habsburg Castle, which is located in what is now a village named Habsburg in the canton of Aargau in Switzerland
They moved out in 1220 or maybe a bit later because it was too small
About 200 years later, they lost it to the Swiss Confederacy
I am already excited for the sequel in november
I heard it will take place in the us
Why they have the medical system they have and a lot of people actually seem to support it
Measurement units

Their obsession with the army, and how soldiers get treated like absolute heros who deserve the whole world
We also do that in Switzerland
I see at lest 15 flags from my balcony
But we dom‘t have that cult around it
That’s an extremely normal way to open a sales call in the US
It’s like a formula
He says that, then you say, “fine thanks, how are you
” Then he says, “great
” Then the call begins
Pretty common in really big countries that depend on patriotism to secure national unity
You will find more than one country in America (continent) where they sing the national hymn and do simmilar stuff every morning before class
The bread thing is so real
Never been to America but to enough other places to know how hard it is to find a goddamn normal loaf of bread that doesn't have the consistency of a marshmellow
Feel free to ask
I‘m not an expert on our weapon laws but I can tell you the basics
But from what I've heard, advertising on TV is a huge thing and they want to advertise a single price and they can do that if they don't include tax
At least that's an explanation I've heard
Back until a few years ago
Moving to a new home/apt
1 day
Had a child (fathers): 1 day
So the joke is the Swiss considering a father's role in the birth of a child to be as tedious as moving apartments
in Switzerland mandatory paid leave:
* 4 weeks paid holidays, 5 for employees younger than 21 years (many companies go a bit further than 4 weeks and give 5 or more weeks for people that are 50 + years of age)
* 14 weeks of maternity leave  - by law only after giving birth, but you might get medical leave (i.e. a doctor certifies you are unfit to work) before giving birth, depending on doctor
Companies get reimbursed 80% of the wages of the employee
* 2 weeks of paternity leave within 6 month of a childs birth, can be claimed as weeks or seperate days -> this law was enacted in december 2019 and became effective 1
2021
* up to three days at a time to care for familymembers that suffer a ' impairment to health', but in total no more than 10 days a year -> also enacted in dec 2019 and effective sinde 1
2021
* limited paid leave for absences due to personal reasons not in ones powers; i.e. leave due to sicknes, accident, other duties by law, mostly military or substitute service, recruitment, fulfilling public office duties, like jury duty (although i'm not sure if any canton still has jury trial) - in these cases the company gets reimbursed 80% of the wages by the Government or (in case of sickness or accident) insurances
there are further "usual days and hours" that have to be granted according to Art
329 Abs
3 OR, which is very imprecise, which leaves a lot of room for interpretation, but those days and hours are usually/often granted as follows :
* appointments with doctors or government agencies, if it's not possible to have them outside of work
* 1 day for relocation (some companies grant more, sometimes depending on if you move out of canton)
* Marriages:
* 2 days for your own marriage
* 1 day for your childs marriage
* cases of death in the family:
* Children or spouse: 3 days
* other family: up to 3 days
* other relatives: 1 day (i'm not entirely sure where the line is drawn between other family / relatives, i presume brothers, sisters and parents count as family, the rest as relatives)
Also, if you are let go and are still in your legal persiod of notice, you are elligible to get paid leave of up to half a day per week to look for a new job - of course, dependiung on your job it is also quite usual to release someone from their duties as soon as they get notice - which means you basically might get up to three months of paid leave
Didn't we vote to have more father's leave just recently
Another speciality of Switzerland is of course the military service
If I’m not mistaken you’ll get up to 25 days of fully paid leave a year to complete it
Yes, fathers now get [two weeks]
Physically impossible - and i just did nit have the right word on the top of my head  edited
[Val Bavona] a small valley in the far end of the Maggia Valley
It is overshadowed by the Verzasca Valley which is next to the Maggia Valley
Verzasca is famous for it‘s „Golden Eye“ Damm, but Val Bavona has beautiful steep cliffs, water as fresh and clear as id gets and also a magnificent waterfall
Indoeuropean seven/siedem/sieben vs
semitic سبعة/ሰባት/שבעה (pronounced mostly like "sabaa")
Despite the superficial similarity, I don't think any relation of indoeuropean and semitic numeral has been proven
Oh but we got plenty
Here's a [small list]
„bekommen“ (German) vs
„to become“
„bekommen“ means „to get“/ „to be given“,
„to become“ would be „werden“ in German
This is a thing sooo many English students from German speaking countries struggle with
It’s even worse since Kommen means To Come
When I was learning German in school, this was a real struggle
Palestine wants their Hammas back
French speaking part of Switzerland here
While I do hear about France a lot, I feel like it’s mostly news about cultural aspects that we share, or news about major events that I am interested in anyway, so I’ve never really felt overwhelmed by it
We’re closer to France than any other country, in some regards even closer than other parts of Switzerland, so I think it’s only natural to be informed of what’s happening over there
Other countries such as Germany or Italy I hardly see any news about, unless it’s really big or I’m actively looking for it
In German news in Switzerland there is quite a lot of Germany and sometimes Austria related stuff but it's not overwhelming
Many people also watch German and maybe also Austrian TV though so they Ivorian /obviously get these news
I don't know how other regions of Switzerland experience it
However, I can say that the amount of news from other linguistical regions of the country is rather underwhelming
In French speaking Switzerland
I follow no French news, but that's probably because I mostly hang out on "English Internet". I don't even really see much of Swiss news to be honest
Definitely the Netherlands
Definitely not Germany
Norway maybe, dont know if I'd move at all
Me too
If you settle in one region, you really don’t need to speak the other languages
I live in the french speaking region, my German is pretty poor and I can’t speak Italian at all
Same for most people I know
Same, it’s definitely the nicest part of the country
I will <3
I'd happily change that rain for a bit of snow, we haven't had any so far
holidays in sicily at the beach: a group of german girls gossip and laugh about my very pale skin

I've never seen a Spanish deck of cards before
Until now I didn't even know it existed
We use French and German cards for most things
We also have lots of regional variations on both of these styles used for a Swiss card game called Jass
I’ve never heard of the spanish deck before
But where I live we use the french deck and the german deck more or less interchangably
There might be a few games that don’t work with one or the other but in general both are aproximately similarly known i would say
But correct me if I’m wrong
I will start to wear a jacket at 10 degrees
At 15 if i have to be outside for prolonged time

above that I only wear a thick shirt or a pullover
EU, blue, "home" (it's not the word "home" itself, but rather a feeling of being home)
Because I said "EU" or because I said "blue"?
Geneva is literally the most boring major city in the whole of Switzerland
Where have all you people been visiting in Switzerland to say it's boring
I'm really curious because I feel there always something going on in my region
How is Freiburg more interesting than Switzerland (I'm there like twice a year and think it's nice but kinda small and boring)
Boring
Where in Switzerland have you been
In my area, there's always stuff going on
Most likey Lauterbrunnen and Bahnhofstrasse
If you only visit the tourist attractions you might think Switzerland is boring, which it isnt
Definitly not more boring than the Netherlands
Like in any other country
The banking sector makes up less than 10% of the swiss economy  fyi
Switzerland has a lot of culture to offer
Theaters, events, shows you name it
For example the biggest hip-hop festival of Europe is in Frauenfeld, Switzerland, Zurich has the highest density of night clubs etc
I believed in everyone I ever voted for
Didn’t always win, but that’s just how it is
I don't vote for electing party members or things like that but I vote on laws so I don't really have that problem
Did you sometimes not vote for your party, because the candidat doesn't have any chance and your vote would go to someone/a party you didn't like
If not, could you imagine not voting for them, because of that
A question about UK politics: Do the MP's usually represent their party or their voting district
In Switzerland, the smaller chamber is made of 1-2 representatives from every canton/voting district
They *should* represent their canton in some way or form, but when voting and in pairlament it doesn't matter so much from where you are, but rahter which party you belong to/what your own opinions are on subjects
There is no such thing as "my" party
I usually look to vote for the party or person that is closest to how I see things
Of course you’ll never agree 100%, but I always vote out of conviction, not out of political calculation
For example there are many people in France who voted Macron instead of Hamon in 2017, because they didn’t want to see a second round of Fillon (right) vs Le Pen (far right)
That’s something I wouldn’t do
I do know I’m a pretty idealist person
How far do your idealistic views go
Example: I'm from a smaller canton (Solothurn) which has only 6 seats in the National Council, so only the biggest few parties can get a seat
My parents really like the EVP/PEV and even know some of them personally, but would not vote for them, because they are on a list with CVP/PDC which they don't really like
My parents would rather vote for SP/PS because it would align more with their views
Regardless of actual politics, would you still vote for the EVP/PEV or would you switch to SP/PS
>However it is important to remember that voting isn't all MPs do, they will still fight for their own constituency's interests in other ways
Yeah, in the smaller chamber in Switzerland this doesn't matter that much
Lol my mother is the same, living in Solothurn and knows people of the EVP
She does still vote for them though, she doesn't seem that bothered by the CVP, as long as it's not the SVP
I would absolutely vote for SP even if he may not get a seat at all
This is exactly what I mean by "sometimes you lose, but that’s just how it is". Imagine everyone just assumed the SP candidate would lose anyway and didn’t vote for him, although if all those who actually liked him had voted for him, he might have had a chance
The internet is a small place
it's very common, and in my personal opinion it should be seen less in public spaces, especially train stations
It's becoming less common
What I've noticed is that teenagers in the "easier" high schools (Sek B and E) tend to smoke way more often than people from the harder one (Gymnasium), I guess there's less peer pressure there (at least at the school I went to)
I am very happy with the no smoking rules put into place in some of the train stations, and the fine for tossing cigarette butts on the ground (80CHF)
I wish that both were better enforced
The amount of smoking in this country is unfortunate
And yes, this is despite it being lower than [most European countries]
>According to official statistics, smoking prevalence in Switzerland is among the lowest in Europe (about 25%, 28% is the average in Europe)
Did anyone else notice that people who go or went to a Sek B or E smoke way more often than people from the Gymnasium
Is there less peer pressure or are people from the gymnasium not cool enough
A ban on smoking at the outdoor section of cafes and restaurants would be wonderful
Actually in my extendend friend group hardly anyone smokes maybe 1 or 2 people
Of course I see plenty of people smoking at the train stations or im Ausgang but idk if it is that prevalent
In Switzerland it was banned for a short time in the beginning
But importing it for personal use was completely legal, just no legal way to sell it
Soon it became completely legal and now you can get it everywhere you can get cigarettes
Many are still directly imported from Sweden and just slap a sticker on it for translations
I was in the gymi and I've seen a lot of people smoke, I'd say that probably, people are more respectful about peer pressure there than what I've heard from my sek friends
but that's a personal experience
Then it probably was a personal experience with my school too, it's also possible that they were more strict about smoking, the school was foe grades 6-13 and you were only allowed to smoke om school grounds starting grade 10
And completely legal here in Switzerland
It's actually a pretty strange situation: there is tobacco free snus which is basically just cellulose with nicotine in the bag
And right now this does not fall under the tobacco tax, so the companies make a lot of money since nobody realizes and the prices are comparable to smoking, which is indeed heavily taxed
I know many people that use snus
Most aren't really addicted and could stop whenever
Some are though
They offered me a job and a residence permit
So here I am in annoyingly beautiful Switzerland
Welcome to Switzerland
What region did you end up in
Any troubles with the language(s)
Romandie/Geneve
French is conversational
But I have an advantage considering I speak Spanish fluently
Nah
I've been here 6 years
Calling Emmentaler "Swiss cheese"
We invemted like a dozen different cheese sorst; Gruyère, Emmentaler, Sprinz, Appenzeller etc
That's like calling Champagne "the french wine" or Kölsch "the german beer".
It has a name
Do your research
Edit: changed Pils to Kölsch
it’s grüezi, not grüzi gopferdamminomol
that works for us too
You're right, you are Bavarians
Weird, it's on wikipedia's german beer sorts article
Switzerland is the only country that has a "bunkers for all" policy, meaning that it has enough underground bunkers to fit the entire population in it, in case of a national emergency like a war or a nuclear strike
In WW2, Switzerland managed to get possession of the newest German Messerschmitt plane that has crashed into our territory
It had all the latest top secret equipment
The allies offered to buy it from us, the Germans offered us multiple regular Messerschmitts in exchange
Being neutral, we decided to let a high ranking German officer come witness us burn it to the ground
That honestly doesnt surprise me at all
Wat
I didn't know we had something so awesome
Oh wait, I know which thread I can post this to
No, they're nuclear bomb shelters, not air raid shelters
According to my corporal, the design was actually tested in the Nevada desert during a US nuclear test - don't know if that's true or not though
No they meant won instead of one
And I just lerned that fact yesterday
It depends on what you want to achieve
If you want to force a regime change, sanctions probably won't help much with that
If you want to hinder a country's capabilities, e.g. in acting aggressively towards others, then hurting their economy will simply reduce the amount of available resources they can spend on foreign policy adventures, or on expensive military programs - regardless of the consequences for the population
Are you my scientific writing prof
You dont understamd all of it do you
I mean i can hear the similarity in some words and maybe even translate or understand a sentence but do you really get all of it
That would be called a casemate, I believe
Help settle a debate
What % of women, sunbathe topless in Europe
Currently in an [argument] with a British redditor who claims up to 50% of women in certain European countries are topless when sunbathing (beach, pool, lake, etc) in public
I don't think it's that high, and put my number at less than 10%.
What's your opinion/experience
That 50% seems very high to me from my own random observations
I think it is less than 20% here these days, and probably closer to your 10% estimate
In the 80's and 90's this was more commonplace, in my experience, and has kind of diminished since then
I have no real numbers or statistics, just the feeling that it is rare
Pretty sure he went to an FKK beach in Germany lol
I agreed with OP in that it's definitely the highest in Spain compared to other places
And would even be confident to say it's probably closer to 20%.
Meaning if I counted 100 women at a beach, I'd probably see (around) 20 people topless
But 50 out of 100 seems crazy, even for Spain
OP's figures
>1 of 2 is realistic for Spain, 1 of 3 is realistic for France, UK I would say 1 of 7, UK is very prudish compared to mainland Europe
Do it regularly or have done it once
Article claims both and there's a huge difference between the two
Agree
And let me explain that I'm not getting into this debate with him/her because I absolutely want to prove their numbers wrong
But because I myself am an American, and the last thing I'd want is for another American to read his figures and come to Europe with the idea (either for pervy reasons or other) that he/she should expect to see half of the women topless
It just reads like a bad r/AskEurope question down the line
Because the beach is for beach goers in that one specific time frame
The Internet is forever and for everyone
Here the median salary is around 6000€ (not the average, I couldn’t find a good source) a month
The cheapest sets of lego they have on the swiss online shop are around 11€, while the most expensive one I found was the Millenium Falcon at 929€ (!)
I guess overall lego is pretty affordable for everyone, although I highly doubt non-fans would spend almost 1000€ on a single set
> I’ve never googled names of anyone I personally know, and expect the same of others
That sounds very naive for your age
But yeah
your host family was rude in that moment
Up to old English I understand pretty much everything
But the "old" and "oldest" English phrases are a mystery for me, I can't understand anything at all
Native German speaker here
Early modern English isn't that bad
Reminds me of Romeo and Juliet, which we read in school
Wasn't to hard to understand but need to read it a bit slower than the normal English we're all used to, probably because of the sentence structure that throws me off a bit
Middle English has a really strange effect on pronunciation
It just makes sense to me
Some words, if I wouldn't understand any English at all, would be pronounced like they are in Modern English just by reading Middle English out loud
Sentence structure is just as strange and old timely as Early Modern English though
Old English looks strange
If it were written in a more normal way then maybe but like this not really
I mean I don't speak Spanish or Dutch, never learned it, but can understand it much better (thanks to French, Latin and some Italian / German&English) than the Old English text
Edit: Scots is strange
Get the gist of it but who the fuck speaks like this
So still widely in use it seems
Nice to know
Switzerlands 1
of August - the story behind it is
Well Swiss people just wanted a national holiday and could not be arsed to actually check the date of the Rütlischwur
I mean, the 1
of August celebrates the Bundesbrief, not the Rütlischwur, even though we kinda mashed the two together somehow in folklore (even though the latter happened on 8
November, according to the tales written over a century after it supposedly took place)
And officially, the 1
of August has only been a national holiday since 1994
Probably this by Federal Council memebr Ueli Maurer
This interview with one of our federal council members Ueli Maurer:
Also our current president Guy Parmelin who can -in his own words- 'english understand'.
[here around the 4:20 min mark]
Switzerland's black spot wasn't so much an "active" atrocity as it was an act of incredible and shameful cowardice
Before and during WWII, many German, Austrian and French Jews tried to seek refuge in neutral Switzerland
In places like Kreuzlingen and Basel they attempted to cross the green border
Some waited until nightfall and swam across the Rhine
This was an extremely dangerous undertaking, especially if they were families or mothers with little children
They knew that if they'd be caught by German border patrol officers, they would be shot on the spot
There are reports of Jewish refugees who got lost in the forest and almost had a heart attack when two men in uniforms suddenly yelled "Hey, you
" - only to find out later with great relief that those officers were Swiss
In most cases, however, the relief did not last long
Instead of offering these people political asylum, Switzerland extradited them right into the hands of the Gestapo
The vast majority of Jewish refugees in Switzerland eventually died a miserable death in a Nazi concentration camp
What's particularly pathetic about this issue is that the Swiss government tried to cover up its responsibility for many decades, claiming it hadn't known about the Nazi death camps at the time
It was only in the early 2000s when a detailed historical research revealed that the Swiss federal council had already been informed about these concentration camps all the way back in 1937
There would've been more than enough time to act if they had wanted to act
Unfortunately, despite the fact that we remained a proper democracy throughout WWII, a significant number of conservative MPs and federal council sympathized with the "Frontist movement", a movement that was very Germanophile and shared a lot of Nazi ideology
The Federal Council at the time was scared shitless of a nazi invasion
They did everything they could to not provoke Hitler, including sending back Jewish people
In the end it worked I guess, but still, it's shameful
If you want to format urls, you can use \[TEXT](URL)  on mobile
I don't understand it either
It was probably out of shame
[Verdingkinder] And that's assuming you give us a pass for the nazi gold
Some might say, taking the gold of Jews during WW2 to secure it and then demanding death certificates for people having died in concentration camps from the descendants to get their money back
But I say, that was technically correct and as we all know, that is the best kind of correct
No, my choice is planning to acquire [the atomic bomb and testing it in the Alps]
Well the Nazi Gold thing is definitly up there, but at least that has been [paid back]
Then there was also the time when the state took [children] away from families because they were poor or because the mother wasn’t married, and sold the kids to rich people where the kids were severely mistreated and used as laborers
That happened up until the 1960ies
Then there’s also the [time] where we kept allied and soviet soldiers that landed in Switzerland in a prison with horrible conditions
Ah I see you got it covered
Merci
I guess
TIL
And I thought the nazi gold was the only recent bad thing
Arbeitswiedereinstiegssonntagabendsdepression
There, I just created it for you
Edit: Arbeitswiedereinstiegssonntagabendsdepressionsbesäufnis would be what you do when you get drunk because you feel so shitty that it's the end of the weekend ;-)
The term for that woud be r/suspiciouslyspecific ;-)
we burn a huge snowman made of hay and wood each spring
the quicker it takes to burn down, the better will the summer be
Höhenfeuer (High up fires)
For our national celebration on 1
August we light up pretty big fires on top of hills
This was used hundreds of years ago as a way of communicating and warning from enemy invasions and so on
Add some firework and lots of flags, if the weather's nice some backyard bbq + drinks and that's basically how we celebrate it
A Swiss who doesn’t have a bank account
Alternatively, a Swiss who doesn’t like cheese or chocolate
A Swiss person who can't ski, a Swiss person who doesn't eat cheese and a Swiss person who doesn't eat chocolate
Regional: Someone from Jura who doesn't have a watch, someone from Graubünden who is a vegetarian, someone from Bern who isn't slow af, anything else
Latin has sol (m) and luna (f) and therefore all romance languages have it like that
Terra (earth) is also female
Latin doesn't have articles though
In Arabic it's like in German: الشمس (aš-šamu, the sun) is female and القمد (al-qamaru, the moon) is male
الأرض (al-'ardun, the earth) is female
I’ve seen people give gender to some countries in english, like calling Britain 'her'. Is that an uncommon thing ?
Alter, „der Nutella“ ist doch beyond fucked
I don't use it myself (we in turn use "der Butter"), but it's probably due to implication with "der Aufstrich". Like it's "die Nintendo Switch" because of "Konsole", even though the older networking hardware is called "der Switch".
actually, I don't think we really had a golden age
in medieval times, Switzerland was very prestigious for its mercenaries, post napoleonic, we're more known for the quality of our products and our banking
I'd say we're more of a slow burn of constant, relative prestige, rather than having one golden age
Nah i don‘t think so
It‘s never been as good as now, in my opinion
Some may say the times before the vienna congress when we had some more territory down in italy, that we don‘t have anymore
I think if we there is a golden age for us, it is now
The rest is just one big silver age
Went to Paris for the Japan Expo 10 years ago with my parents and a friend of mine
The last Saturday she had **huge** pain in her belly, was lightheaded and a few other symptoms
We tried to go to the hospital but the E.R. was closed
Tried like 4 clinics with E.R.s but all closed too
The only one that was open had the on duty doctor only arriving in the middle of the afternoon when it was 10am
Receptionist tried to call her until she got a hold of her because my friend was visibly in pain
The doctor made my friend explain was was going on on the phone and sent us to another clinic to get some scans and tests
Turns out one of her kidneys had shutdown and she needed immediate medical attention
Yeah, never ever take a taxi in Switzerland
It's a rip-off
Use public transportation as it will take you almost anywhere
Still expensive, but not as much as a taxi
That's the question of the decade mate
We were puzzled to say the least
To be fair the E.R. from the Paris hospital was technically opened since we could enter but there was noone except for two cops and one cuffed guy
There was a sign on the receptionist desk saying it was closed
Yeah it was a great week until that point
Just like how the fuck does that happen in bloody capital
It's one thing to joke that France is a third-world country, it's another to experience it
Yeah
We were fucking panicked
I can't understand how the bloody capital doesn't have a decent E.R. and on duty doctor system
She would have gotten taken care almost immediately it happened here
Well we did ask the taxi to take us to the E.R. from the nearest hospital and the sign said both "hôpital" and "urgences"
The E.R. was empty except for two cops, a cuffed guy and a sign saying "urgences fermées" on a desk
We then proceeded to call another cab who was friendly enough to take us to 4 places and even waited for us in-between if it was closed
Sorry that happened to you
Really poor behaviour from the police
I usually feel pretty save in Switzerland but there's obviously shitty people everywhere
A hijacked Ethiopian Airlines plane was headed to Geneva (pilot wanted asylum in Switzerland), but had to be intercepted by French/Italian fighter jets because the Swiss Air force doesn't work on nights and weekends
In Geneva, robbers robbed a bank while they were at circa 50m from a police station
The police came to the scene and they did not land a single shot
(not one the robbers and neither on their can)
Thought of another:
French woman called in anonymously to Geneva Airport claiming a woman was carrying a bomb and planned an attack
Military was called in, airport was shut down, flights were cancelled
Turns out the woman was suspecting her husband had a mistress (alleged bomber) and wanted her to be arrested
She spent 3 months in prison and was ordered to pay a 100K fine
Iirc it was also during a time where we were discussing buying new airplanes
Which made it even more hilarious
Haha didn't know that pne but sure sounds like us
Explanation
Here in Basel we had a casino robbery a few years back, where the thieves ran to France since the border was so close to the casino itself
>Iirc it was also during a time where we were discussing buying new airplanes
Which made it even more hilarious
New jets, right
The Gripen discussion
And yet here we are again
Then that's on the store
I shop a lot in France and I've never seen something as expensive as a PS4
A) Not have a security tag
B) Be able to be taken off the shelf without a worker opening it with a key
The Jura mountains for sure
I love lac de Joux and the canton of Neuchâtel particularly
A good friend of mine lives in Basque and when I visited, they introduced me to the joy of pintxos and showed me around the area
I'm still not over how pretty the Flysch are
German is not really widely spoken outside of Europe though
No idea, porbably ourselves because of not letting the jews money into switzerland but not the jews themselves
Dutroux is a meme even in other countries
As far as "regular" people go, he is super hated
We really don't have any super well known and loved or hated public figures
Somehow it would be so *not* Swiss to have that
I think it‘s more because more people were racist and antisemitic back then
But it could be both ;)
I keep hearing the name here in Switzerland quite often when it comes to sarcastic comparisons or remarks regarding the justice system
Him, and Fritzl, though Dutroux is considered much worse
Well exactly speaking like a swiss german is i would say impossible ive seen Germans that did it pretty solid but you can tell the difference really quick
In French I think it the grammar is easily achievable, the problem lies more in the accent
I’d say it’s still possible to pass for a native as a foreign speaker, but the only people I’ve heard do so have learned French fluently as a child
Otherwise, all foreign speakers I heard had an accent
French - It is very hard for both, insanely hard
Hell even native people make a lot of mistake
Swiss german is pretty much impossible to learn perfectly as a non native speaker, I think
Some germans try it but it usually sounds off
I‘ve heard one accepted refugee speak perfect swiss german, though
I think he was some kind of language genius or something because he was only learning it for maybe two years
I’m french-speaking, living in Germany and speak german so well noone has ever suspected I am not a native speaker
I would say it is only possible if you learn it as a kid
I tried to learn hungarian for a few months with duolingo
It‘s incredibly hard and I think I forgot most of it again
My grandparents on my fathers side fled from hungary in the fifties but my dad sadly never taught me hungarian
My grandma told me that I was able to communicate a bit as a toddler after a long-ish vacation in hungary, tho
And I guess it‘s good that I‘m at least kind of used to hearing it
But yeah
I can‘t even pronounce egy correctly so it must sound horrible to native speakers haha
PS: loooooove the food
My grandma and my dad sometimes make goulash and I could eat tons of it
Also my dad sometimes brings some kind of  salami with paprika in it
Not sure if that‘s very common but i love it
That phrase is mostly used to mock natives who made mistakes
At least here it is
Yes, yes, yes
How is that even a question
Unfortunately, I know this is never going to happen
Swiss people are the kind of voters who reject a [popular initiative to get 6 weeks of paid vacation] Yup, people in this country have been offered more holidays and their answer was "no thanks, I'd rather waste more time in the office instead of having fun with my family and friends
" Swiss people are also the kind of voters who reject proposals to introduce a minimum wage, to introduce socialized healthcare like in the rest of Western Europe or to introduce a UBI
hell is going to freeze over before Swiss voters say yes to a 4-day work-week
Thanks to the Germans who put up with the endless flood of Swiss shopping tourists that clog your shopping centers, supermarkets and especially drugstores in all cities close to the border, stubbornly speak Schwitzerdütsch and demand you understand them, and make you give MwSt
back to them (if you import goods from the EU to Switzerland you can get the taxes you paid instore back, bc taxation in the EU is different than it is over here
You are allowed to import goods worth up to 300CHF to Switzerland tax-free so Germany is basically one big dutyfree store to us)
Dutch is so weird it sounds like I should understand it perfectly but no chance in actually knowing what they said
Reading is ok if it's really basic stuff
Swiss-French and other French aren‘t all to different
Swiss-Italian and italian isn’t all to different either
All the Swissgerman dialects on the other hand are a lot more different to the German and Austrian-German  dialects
About Dutch well if you try hard enough at least for me you can understand the context what they are saying
Oh the second one we sang in religion class, too
I really liked it it had a nice melody
Both the music and the language
Everytime I turn on TVI it's always football lol
Does it exist
Yes otherwise people wouldnt indentify with it
Do I indentify as european
No not at all
Yes, very much so
Not necessarily in the sense that we all are the same (or should be), but in that we're much more the same than we are different
I feel and identify much more as "European" than "Swiss".
The fact that we don't share a common language I don't see as a hinderance - quite the opposite in some way
Being at least somewhat familiar with several languages is something most Europeans share
Or take city planning for example
I can navigate European cities
There's usually a well defined city center, and often an old town area nearby
Central train station too, probably
Distances are walkable, and there's a ton of "mixed use" zoning with little shops, restaurants and cafes mixed into residential areas
North America
Not so much
Residential and commerical zones are often heavily separated, downtown might be mainly a business district
Train stations feel more like an afterthought than the hub they often are in European cities
Suburbia, strip malls with huge parking lots - that's just not things we're familiar with here, at least not to that degree
I feel like something fundamental like this contributes much more to a shared European experience than things like a common language - or a common currency for that matter
> Do you even feel "European" at all
Or you feel more "connected" to your own country of origin
no there is nothing which connects me culturally with someone from Spain, Estonia or Bulgaria
I can't think of a single thing we share not even the alphabet in Bulgaria's case
The only transnational bond I feel is to the rest of the German speaking world and even that declines quite rapidly the further away it is
But there at least the cities often look the same, the people talk the same language and we all know Göthe, Schiller and the Nibelungenlied or also more contemporary things like DSDS lol
> Do you believe that we can create a new Nation,a new "Superpower" just by agreements,good words and peace
If a European state is formed then for geopolitical reasons and not because the people felt the radical need to be part of the same country
I wouldn't like that to happen though if we look at other multicultural states which formed in the end one culture became dominant and started to replace the local ones like Prussia in Germany for example and now people in Munich only speak Standard German and no longer Bavarian
The German values for example are originally Prussian values
I never looked into it but I'd bet it's the very similar in Italy
> Do you really believe we can build a federation only through good words and good intentions,not even having a common language to begin with
yes Switzerland is the best example of that or how a federal Europe could work in general but Switzerland was also formed by foreign powers, a common identity only really emerged due to outer threats in WW2 and it nearly fell into civil war in WW1
>I think being something like Switzerland is exactly what a federal Europe would be like
Direct democratic rights on a European level
Having multiple "heads of government" instead of one (and constitutionally ensuring that the population is represented in those)
Edit: just curious what aspects you have in mind
Disclaimer: I hate it when people label a city/country as a whole as "overrated" or <another negative label>. They're toursity for a reason, and life outside of tourism also does happen in those places
With that said, I'm gonna shift the discussion to mean a landmark/site, because some of those truly are ????
The Little Mermaid in Copenhagen
Every single person around me was like "Oh
That's it
" Same goes for the Flower Clock in Geneva, and (to an extent) Stonehenge
while not really overrated, cause they really are pretty, Lauterbrunnen and Luzern are very touristic
Lauterbrunnen is the place that looks like yosemite Valley with waterfalls, that you'll see everywhere with captions about how pretty Switzerland is
Luzern is a city in Central Switzerland that captures the kind of Swiss aesthetic pretty well
it has a modern city life, yet an old city core, it is situated at a pretty lake and its position puts it on the border between the picturesque alps and the populated plateau
You'll see tonnes of tourists there and there's this running joke that there are more Japanese people in Luzern than there are Swiss people, because it is very popular with East Asian visitors
Saw Stonehenge driving past it on the motorway
Didn't look impressive
Also: Manneken Pis in Brussels,you have the massive and beautiful square with the town hall (so impressive
) but all the tourust flock into the side street to that stupud 40cm tall fountain that's squeezed in some house corner
Interlaken
Nice place, don't get me wrong, but you can get as cute towns nearby with less than a quarter of the tourists Interlaken has
Guess it's so crowded because Lauterbrunnen and Grindelwald are nearby
For the sculpture category also: Manneken Pis in Brussrls
It's like 40cm tall
>the Flower Clock in Geneva
Geneva is my home town and I love it, but that flower clock is the most underwhelming touristic attraction I've ever seen
And yet I bring people there each time they come visit because it's in their guides and they want to see what it is about
The good thing is that it's in a nice area so at least you can resume your stroll to a nice place quite fast
What gets me with London is just how big it really is
I've been there twice, each time for a few (intense) days, and I still feel like I haven't seen even half of it
I was only in Amsterdam for now and it definitely felt more like an "amusement park" rather than an actual city where people live
Lucca for example, half an hour away
I have ptsd everytime I hear a bike ring
Well that's not that bad then
Here in Switzerland you easily pay about 6-7€ per 0
5l just in any regular bar
So pretty much the same then for me, of course there's a big difference due to purchase power but yeah
Damn that's quite a difference though
Yeah now I got it, thanks
I only knew the fake wiesn in zurich was really overpriced (15€, seat costs additionally) so the real one looked nice enough to me
I heard you need a reservation but never checked
It's quite small and nobody I know has ever been so there's that
Ok, thanks for all the insight
I was thinking of going maybe this or next year as I've never been but in that case I think I'll check out a smaller one first :)
we‘re pretty neutral but i‘d say germany or austria
We like to keep to ourselves, so basically anyone that fucks with us
Maybe austria, because they are just a copy uf us or we of them
Depends on the region, but whoever is on the other side of the border from where we live in Switzerland
Edit : except Lichtenstein
Austria and Germany for sure
also Singapore; they're taking away all our shady bank business
I would say Germany
I just lost it at pussy phone, thanks for that
Jungfraujoch or how they like to call it "The Top of Europe". We have a million mountains to visit, why visit the one that costs you an insane amount of money
If you do it because you like the train experience there are other options as well
Gornergrat or the Bernina for example
Its by far the most famous tourist trap in Switzerland imo and as long as it is this expensive, not worth it
Also with the verb 'violer', Viola in english means Alto, but in french it means rape
The word "respectively" is quite similar to the last one you've mentioned
In German, "respektive" means something like "put differently" or "in other words". In English, "respectively" means something like "A belonging to A and B belonging to B" ("She and I were 25 and 27 years old, respectively
Overall it's pretty nice living here, but I don't like the mentality of most people here
If I were to move I'd probably choose the Netherlands
as much as I like complaining about it, I probably could not see myself living anywhere else long term
I've lived in Japan for a year and in the USA for a year, which was fun, but I couldn't do it forever
Yes I love living here
It's the best country in the world (both statistically and patriotically speaking)
I'd never ever move somewhere else
I've lived at various places for shorter times and everytime I missed Switzerland
wtf bdsm is not forbidden in Switzerland
This [meme] I made for this comment sums it up
Great natural armour, although I wouldn't mind being in Scandinavia as well, cause winters are too warm here for me
It really feels like we’re at the heart of Europe, so that’s nice
It’s easy to travel, from Lausanne where I live both Paris and Milano are only 4 hours away by train
It’s also what gave Switzerland it’s amazing cultural diversity, which I really enjoy
The landscape is obviously beautiful, with the mountains and the lakes
Only complaint maybe is that I sometimes wish we had access to the sea
CZECHIA
I love the historical borders of my first homeland Czechia literally in the heart of Europe
**Czechia**, also known as the Czech Republic, is a very picturesque country in Central Europe
It borders Poland, Slovakia, Austria and Germany
Every year millions of tourists from all over the world visit my country
Many people regard Prague as one of the most beautiful cities in Europe and worldwide
But Czechia is much more than only Prague
There are 12 UNESCO World Heritage sites, many medieval towns and picturesque landscapes
This website presents the most amazing places to visit in Czechia, the very heart of Europe

don’t forget you also have a huge as piece of jungle in south america
Love to Slovakia from brotherly Czechia
Amazing Lithuania, love from Czechia
But Switzerland has the front row of seats
You can then make Greater Switzerland by conquering all of the world
they aren’t part of proper france
they’re almost independent
i was wondering the same thing
Don't worry my dude
Black people are just like everyone else
So if everyone here is capable of understanding a joke with one exception it's going to be the same way for black people
I am German and grew up in Switzerland
You might not be able to take jokes about Germans but I love a good joke no matter if it's about my nationality or anything else
Pretty rare, so far i have seen two in my life
Both were a 4x4 variant
The Korean/American/South American side of me
French colleagues invited us over to a park for a bbq
When we showed up the host lead us to an empty grill informing us we could cook our food here
"wait
my food
"wait
you didn't bring food
"wait
you have to bring your OWN food
"yeah
it's a bbq
"exactly
"exactly
Reading these comments made me realize why my Portuguese parents eat dinner at 10
Growing up with Swiss culture and standards I always found it weird how my classmates ate dinner at around 6 and my family about 4 hours later
>He is obligated to let me cross the road by law
Every big european city: I'm gonna pretend I didn't see that
Was in Madrid for work last week
Spanish coworkers left for lunch at 2 PM
Had a meeting at 4 PM
They got back at 5 PM
"It's ok we usually work past 7 PM here
Just no
Yeah our dinner ended past 11 PM
F. me
Stage 2
In a lot of cultures outside of Europe if you invite someone over to your house during dinner hours (let's say 5PM - 8PM), the expectation is you will feed the guests dinner
Not the case in France/Switzerland/Scandinavia/etc
I've had many instances where I show up and am fed some charcuterie, wine, bread, nuts and the night kind of ends
That's a cardinal sin in Asian cultures
I've never been to an event like that where it wasn't specifically stated by the host that you bring your own food
My mom is Swiss, dad is Peruvian
Very often we eat dinner twice, a cold one at 5 and a huge Burger at 9 or so because we are already hungry again
Mom just accepts it now and even asks for the Burger too
Forgot to mention, I was grumpy because I was up since 5AM to catch a flight to make a 9 AM meeting, that THEY scheduled, which ended up starting at NOON (which is around the time normal people usually eat)
I'm not even Asian but still expect dinner when I'm invited to someone's place at those hours
Do people in Switzerland really invite their friends and then it's just that nobody is having dinner that day or something
Are there regional differences regarding this phenomenon
Yeah I wondered that too, always had trouble with it as I normally go to sleep at 11
Often I just skip diner
Guess it has something to do with business closing hours – when we're in Portugal visiting family, I often notice that many shops are still open on late evenings
Here you would have to be very very lucky to find any shops open after 6 pm
Or maybe it's just a simple cultural difference
Reading the comment from the Finnish flair above confirms my complaint
There's no need to specify that it is "FOR DINNER". If it's an invitation during dinner hours, my assumption is food will be served
>  They stayed untill midnight, and we had no proper food to serve
It was awkward to say the least
What I would do in this scenario
* Cook up whatever is in the fridge/freezer
* If the above is not possible, you order take out
* If the above is not possible, you sort of hint to the guest that it's time they start hitting the road
Thing is, in the cultures I'm from the 3rd option is not possible
You will go outside and cut some greens or hunt an animal before you let a guest leave hungry
Problem was
Our meeting was between lowlings, the lunch was with the super boss, and he was the reason it was 3 hrs
I guess hierarchy is big in Spain
I read that too
Also the whole struwwelpeter
I'm not that old and everybody my age knew and most read it as well/got it as a picture book
Der Wolf und die Geisslein
We have it too
Isn‘t it one of Grimm‘s Fairytales
Right, I didn‘t remember it very clearly
Also the decapitation detail is gruelling
Thanks for clearing it up:)
the Swiss
because we've got 7 heads of states
One of our guys in the  Federal Council already looks like Agent 47 [ , my money is on him
They would probably do everything to avoid joining the fight tho
Last time I checked there were seven
brother Maynard, bring up the holy hand grenade
would you look at that I really just misspelled 7 and didn't notice
I‘ve experienced something similar between Germany and Switzerland
In Switzerland, Mittag (noon) means like 12:00 - 14:00, while I‘ve heard some Germans use the term Mittag for the whole afternoon
Actually yes, we do have some
Billboards are pretty rare but we have a smaller versionnof those everywhere
Usually directly up against a wall of a house, sometimes free standing along roads and everywhere on public transport stations
They're about 1m off the ground and usually 1m x 2m in size
As it's easy to rent you get changing ads on those all the time and from timt to time even religious ones
The most common (maybe only
) Ones I know are a plain blue background with yellow font in the middle
The text is usually something positive in the way of "love your neighbor as you love yourself" or "god will protect you". (Not literally those but in this kind of way
Usually good sentences, not you'll rot in hell or something)
I unfortunately saw a few in Switzerland around where I live recently, but just some generic stuff like "god loves you" or whatnot
Dutch
I understand a lot when I read it but the pronunciation - totally different story
So I can't speak it and don't understand it spoken
Dutch, Its like we are long lost brother or something
This only applies to swiss though, germans dont have a clue when reading dutch
We love our little secret language
JÄ HUERÄ SIECH I VERSTICKÄ UND NIEMER CHUNNT CHO HÄLFÄ!
Man, every time I show any of my german friends written swiss german, they understand everything except siech, it's hilarious
We call it Bünzlitum
It's impossible to describe, but this should give you a good overview:
Chnabäschüüsse
A kind of festival where the best shooter gets a reward
Schwingä
A one on one fight with special belts in an arena of sand
Cities staying in a rather rural style than in a modern urban one
Here we for example have not a single sjyscraper
Reason given us that most people don't want our cities to become typicel skyline-cities
This is mostly Swiss-german tho, we french speakers are a bit more easy going I think
I think so, yes
Not for us
I did, for talking too loud at a public fireplace near the woods
Several times
I guess Döner/Kebab in the cities, not so much in the countryside
Generally speaking, Swiss people don't eat much fast food
It's considered something you do as a teenager and you're supposed to grow out of it sometime in your mid 20s.
Gipfeli mit Schoggistängeli
Kebab isn’t swiss tho
Also I’ve never heard anyone say you’re expected to stop eating fast food in your 20s, what the hell
I don’t know where you live but here in Lausanne fast foods have been flourishing, there’s more than ever

I have seen it a few times, but it's very rare to have a flag somewhere outside your home
Restaurants often have them, other than that it's not that common
it's not odd, you do need a permit to put up a flag pole, though
Swiss people casually wear shirts or hats or houseshoes with the flag on it
Thou 10-15 years ago more than today
I can see 10-15 flagpoles with swiss flags from my balcony
But we don‘t have that flag culture that we treat the flag as a holy object and it has to be folded in this way and stuff
No clue if it's common to have one but I definitely can't see the flag a lot when outside
The trams and buses have flags on them on important holidays (but also the cantonal flag), important buildings might have them but that's about it
The flags of the cantons can be seen more often in public
And then there's the allotment gardens where many people have flags but many of them are forgein ones
However, during the World Cup and the European Cup (or whatever it's called in English) you will see a lot more flags and during important hockey tournaments and the Olympics as well I guess
Depends where you live
In Valais, especially in the moutain, a lot of chalets have a pole with a flag
I see more people displaying flags of their canton than the national one
True, the mountain regions have plenty of flags
It's just not that common in villages or cities (I live near St
Gallen)
Oh damn, I completely forgot about the flags of cantons, those are pretty common on lamp posts or (not as often) just randomly waving in someone's garden
As for the national flag, you rarely see that one waving in public
Oh yeah for sure, in big cities it's much less common
I see more Portuguese, Spanish and Italian flags during football season than I do Swiss flags all year in my city
But definitely see a lot of Swiss flags on chalets and rural touristy places
In the cities it’s common to see the flag hanged in public, like on [bridges] for examples, but people hardly ever have one hanging around their home that’s true
The cost of living in general but the thing I hate the most is the work mentality
Constitutional sexist discrimination that demands me to either give up one year of my life or alternatively demands me to pay higher taxes
Nepotism to get good jobs
You often need connections
You got me with the “print it out” its so hilarious but at the same time makes me want to cry because it is so true
I work in Switzerland but for some reason live in Germany-after living in the Caribbean for a long time, I want to slam my head against a wall when I see my poor little children being swamped with stacks of terribly-done black-and-white copies to work through by themselves at home or sit in front of the worst, unstable, chaotic and unsafe “school learning platform” ever brought online
That'd be cheap in Switzerland
5 GB data is easily 40 - 50+ CHF (~35 - ~45+ Euros) a month (depending on what else is included)
[Example plans for Switzerland
[And another one
To be fair, the our salaries are proportionate to the cost of living, on median
I would say the constant "compromising". Everything takes forever to get done
Being able to "oppose" to basically anything is great, but makes everything have to start over too many times
Need to build a new school because of population growth
Just having authorisation by the community can take years because someone opposed to the project due to the fact that "kids are noisy".
Want to build a new metro line
Opposed, and by the time the project gets through, it's way over budget and already obsolete
Want to build a new house
Opposed because the doorway doesn't match the village esthetics
I'm aware I've only stated construction examples because I don't want to get into political stuff haha
Sure, it makes the country (usually) more stable than most, but it's a damned hassle
Edit : spelling
Yup
I have asthma and the military doctor just told me I was not able to be in the army, I asked to do the PC then and he told me no
Now I have to pay when I could have at least done the PC
It's time to accept "[Service Citoyen] (service for all citizens - but open up more ways of service)
I am a very enthusiastic supporter
what i find the most infuriating about that is the payment if you‘re double UT
I guess it makes sense so you can‘t just be like „yeah i wanna kill people“ and get double UT and be „free“. However it‘s really unfair for people who have no chance of serving at all
also the men only thing made sense when it was invented, but nowadays there should either be mandatory civil/military service for everybody, or none at all
I half disagree on this one
It is true that things end up taking longer to build, but at least once they're built they are very nicely done and everyone is happy with the outcome as everyone got their say
From what I've experienced (I'm a late millenial btw), most boomers are really set in their ways
You do it like you are supposed to, you do it because you are told so
Everything is very by the book and leaves no room for improvisation
Work hours are to be respected and and things like that
I haven't worked with zoomers that much but I think their way of working doesn't differ much from the other millenials I've worked with (all born between 89 and 95) Most are more relaxed, as long as the job is done by the times it's supposed to be done, you can work when you want
You do things in the way you want as long as it's good and you explain what you did and how you did it
Again this is just my experience but I found that boomers tend to focus on how things are done whereas younger generations only really care about the result
And for your fist question, I feel like Swiss work mentality is more like the old ways, the more you work the better
Even if you are sick you come to work because not going is mostly frowned upon, you also do unpaid extra hours
I've had many acquainances being burned out because of work, some as young as 22 years old, and some coworkers working at home on the weekends just so the boss is happy on Monday
Yeah, I can relate to your situation
It's just messed up and I unfortunately don't think it will be resolved any time soon
I will/do support that, but they have remained extremely quiet over the years since I first noticed them
Let's see how their plan works out
>open up more ways of service
PS: which in principle is already the reality for Swiss men, since in addition to mandatory military service, Swiss men also have mandatory civil defense service
In Switzerland there is mandatory military service for men only, lasting around a full year of service
If a man is unfit to serve they will pay a tax of 3% as compensation
Women are exempt from mandatory service and from the tax
That isn't true
Everyone us only half happy
Trying to satisfy makes no-one happy
So maybe you can say everyone is satisfied, but not happy
And that's when things actually get done
If I understood the Idea behind Service Citoyen correctly it'd also include things like Firefighters which are currently not covered
Spending one year of your life in service of the society you live in is more than fair
If you think what society provides for you personally I find it absolutely incomprehensible how someone could be against serving
Serving your community/society also helps with identification with that community/society
The current situation in Switzerland is that all Male citizens have to serve
They can do so either as Military Service (Military stuff), in Civil Protection Service (running and maintaining public bomb shelters, helping the civilian population in emergency situations), or Civil Service (eg
helping out in a hospital or school)
The idea behind "Service Citoyen" is to make it mandatory for all citizens to serve (yay - genderequality)
But in turn open up more ways that service can be spent, eg
by also including service as a Firefighter
Interestingly enough firefighting service once was one of the other duties that only were mandatory for men depending on the commune
But since that service was demanded by local law it was ruled unconstitutional after the equality law was implemented
they probably want to cover many different areas,. I just wanted to point out that contrary to popular believe Swiss men do not only have the duty to serve in the army but technically also the duty to serve in civil defense
Why does everyone call it "forced labor"? That's 100% the wrong comparison to draw
If it was anything like "forced labor" everyone would be opposed to it - obviously
It's not like the government get's a profit out of it, at least not in military or civil protection service, in civil service you do work for something beneficial for society, which I guess one could say the government profits off of, but it's absolutely your choice what work you do, the government doesn't tell you what to do, so again calling it "forced labor" is more than a stretch
So in one type of service it's your choice (and only your choice) what exactly you do and in the other two types you are primarily training for emergency situations, not doing any work (not saying that it isn't a demanding activity, not at all, but no direct use is gained form it so it's not work - it's training)
>perform a service of the state's choosing
**Which is not the case** \- you can choose to either do Military service or Civil service
While, yes, in the military you don't get to choose what exactly you do, the decision to do military service is entirely yours (and only about 30 - 40% do choose that path)
In Civil Service you are almost entirely free what to do, certainly no one will tell you what to do - find something that benefits society, get permission to do it as part of your civil service, do it (**You have to find what to do,** the government won't tell you
Popular options are helping out in a hospital or school, actions to help the environment (a friend of mine spent 4 weeks collecting garbage in forests for example), even just being a helping hand for families in need can qualify (During Covid working in Contact Tracing was also a popular option)
Civil Service isn't even necessarily spent in government organizations (Hospitals are generally private companies, actions for the environment are generally some sort of non-profit, etc
All the Swiss militia system (that's what the whole system is called) does is telling you to do something for your community for a fixed amount of time
Something anyone should do anyways, so what's wrong with making it mandatory
I think most people agree that doing something for your community is a good thing that everyone should do from time to time, so why don't just make it mandatory
I really struggle to see why everyone is talking about forced labor
There's absolutely non of that in the whole system
You choose one of three (or two) forms of service: yes, if choose military service you might end up having to accept orders and to what you're told, but in no way is it the case that you are forced into military service
If you choose civil service no one will tell you anything - you are literally free to do anything that benefits society, not even working for the government in most cases, non-profit organizations (eg
Environmental protection organizations) or even private companies (eg
Hospitals) are perfectly valid options - the only connection to the government is that they pay you during that time (if you are employed not even that, then the government pays your employer and they just keep paying you) .
That's absolutely true
Adding more ways of service isn't meant for "tayloring" serving to women, it's a simple necessity from sheer numbers alone
The argument usually given is that if you suddenly make serving mandatory for everyone you essentially double the amount of people, but all the existing categories are set up in a way that they are 'filled' with the current amount of people (not quite true, army and civil protection service are chronically understaffed)
Essentially doubling the amount of people in the army is not feasible politically, simmilar story in the other categories (the only exception maybe being the civil service), so to double the amount of people you also have to create some new categories
Tough to say at this point
It may even illegal by international law, which in contrast to military type services clearly forbid mandatory citizen work
To be honest with you, with respect to this particular topic, I have learnt to have very little expectations
My prediction is that Swiss men will continue to get constitutionally discriminated
There has not yet been any vote on it - so it's a bit hard to say
There are of course studies, but just because a study says it's supported by the general public does not mean it'd pass in a vote
That all said, the first study I found by googling just now said 63% of participants were in favor of the idea
Which I think is quite realistic - at least in my social circle the Idea is very popular
>You're forced to do *labour*, i.e. work, for the state
In the case of civil service you usually don't even work for the government (you are payed by them, but don't work for them); typical civil service things to do are working in a hospital (Private, or at least privatized, companies), working for some non-profit or environmental organization (WWF is a popular choice), working in schools is also a classic and among the classics is the only one where you work for the state (unless you work at a private school, which is also possible) - you can even go abroad and work for some humanitarian organization in some part of the world where help is needed
The militia system really isn't about doing work for the government - it just isn't. It's about doing good for society, be that by training for being ready to defend it (military service), training for being ready to protect/safe people in case of emergency (civil protection service) or by doing good work somewhere in society (civil service)
I think you probably agree that any of these things are good things to do, things ideally every individual should do (call it a moral obligation to do good to your community if that's your style)
What are laws good for if not to compel all people into being good people
So why not make it mandatory for people to do one of these, undoubtedly good, things things for a tiny percentage of their time
The point is that every member of society should do these things, so Switzerland made it mandatory (currently only for male citizens, but the political wheels are turning)
If you are employed, you employer is paid 80% of your average daily salary per day, and they have to pay you at least that much (as though you were still working for them), some employers continue to pay you 100% of your salary (paying the remaining 20% out of their pocket), some pay somewhere in between the 80% and your full salary - you get the picture
If you are not employed you get paid 80% of your daily average income or at least 62 CHF directly
Which for some people, for example for student like me, makes serving even interesting from a financial point of view (my average daily income is 0
- but I get 62
- a day during the four weeks of service I do every year)
In addition to that payment (called Salary replacement payment) you are also payed an additional sum per day (Greman: Sold) in cash (the exact amount depends on a multitude of factors, but it's somewhere between 5
- and 15
It's payed in cash because it's tax exempt, so it has to be cash
Do you agree that being a Firefighter, being a reservist for emergency response units (eg
helping after floods), helping out families in need or cleaning up forests is a good thing to do
Do you agree that in an ideal society everyone would spend at least a small portion of their time doing something in this vein
If yes - then you cannot be against the militia system, because that's literally all it is
Note: none of these things are things that can be done professionally, So your argument of "just hire professionals" doesn't work
Yet they either need to happen or at the very least it's a good thing that they happen - I wouldn't want to live in a society where these jobs are not done
we shall see
>so surely a lot of people would choose to do it if it were an optional program
I seriously doubt it - I wouldn't have
Yes it's financially interesting, but it's also a huge pain in the backside missing 4 weeks of Uni, not being able to attend exams if I'm unlucky (that thankfully has not yet happened)
People who are employed certainly wouldn't, employers would also very much like it if they did not have to let their employees go off for four weeks a year, having to pay them without them doing the work
Isn't that what laws are for
Mandating you to do things that one 'should do' anyways as a good human - unfortunately one usually doesn't without external pressure
Some certainly do, but it should be everyone - so it has to be mandatory
In any given town there'll be a fire maybe once a year, maybe two car crashes where the Firefighters are needed
What does that give, three days where Firefighters are usefull
Let's double that for good measure 6 days ~ 1 week
What do you with them the other 51 weeks/year
Pay them to sit around
It's just not a full time job, in cities maybe (in some Swiss cities there are professional firefighters), but outside the cities
A few weeks of basic training once, then a refresher for a day or two once or twice a year and you've got yourself a firefighter for years
They can have normal, civilian jobs through the majority of the year and on the few days a year you actually need them they're there, fully trained and ready to put out a fire or cut open a car
Same story with soldiers, 18 weeks of basic training (or more if you want to climb the ranks) once and then yearly refreshers
The Swiss army has just over 140'000 Soldiers, the vast majority (~95%) have a normal civilian job for most of the year and just go to refreshment courses for a 3 weeks (4 weeks for officers) a year
But in times of crisis they're fully trained and ready
>Laws are for creating a safe environment for everyone to live as freely  as possible
So people can make their own choices and pursue their own  desires without risk of being harmed by others
100% agree
To do so they limit each individual, mandating what they have to do and cannot do, mandating you to be a "good human", mandating you to let everyone have their freedom, just as you have yours
To allow everyone to pursue their own desires as far as possible the law sets equal (at least in theory - see equality discussions everywhere) boundaries and duties on everyone, one of these duties is serving your community
Because without that society cannot function, and everyone loses all of their freedoms
I don't know how other countries do it, it certainly is an extremely important corner stone of Swiss society
Without militia service (be that military service or civil service) , there'd be basically no Firefighters (within a margin of error there are no professional firefighters in Switzerland), hospitals would be severely understaffed, so would schools (Especially in rural areas), there'd be no one who could help after natural catastrophes/emergencies (basically all contact tracers and all other extra staff needed during the current CoVid crisis are people doing their service)
>than having to continuously train new ones that leave after a year
You obviously don't understand the system
A Firefighter trains once, for a few weeks (not quite sure how long exactly)
They are then available for service for literal years, decades even
Going about their normal civilian lives unless they're needed
Their counter of how many days they served only counts on a day when they are actually needed (or on a few training days a year)
Same with Soldiers, 18 weeks of basic training once (or longer if you want climb the ranks), then 3 weeks a year (or 4 weeks a year for officers) of repetition training for a few years, and then in reserve for years, sometimes decades
Having normal jobs, but being ready if needed
(For military service you can also do it all in one go if that's more convenient for you, but that's not the norm
What's cheaper: having professionals sitting around most days still being paid, or having a militia force being fully trained but usually in their civilian lives, with civilian jobs, not being paid by the government, but still ready when needed
In an emergency there's no difference between the two, in both cases you can call them and they will come and solve whatever problem there is
It also means that in basically every civilian environment you can imagine there are people with training in First Aid, Firefighting, other Emergency responses, Leadership (Officers) - that has a profound, positive, impact on society; That's the Swiss 'Militia' system, and yes it is deeply ingrained in our culture, but it's also extremely important for our society
I'm not saying it can't work without, I'm saying society would look extremely different if it was different
I remember a school mate got angry because Dragonball Z was interrupted by the 9/11 news
We were something between 8 and 10

Germany (heavy cultural influence)
Italy (roman empire)
France (especially Napoleon)
Austria (Habsburg family comes from Switzerland)
Can't decide USA or GB because swiss immigrants in the US and english tourists influencing swiss culture heavily
I guess it would be all the neighbours: Germany, France, Italy, Austria and Liechtenstein which conveniently enough are exactly 5 countries
You'd also hear their respective predecessors, like the Habsburg Empire and the HRE (or as I like to call it: HRR(dN)) since the territory that is now Switzerland was in large parts owned by the Habsburgs and the Habsburgs also originate in Switzerland (Habsburg is a castle in Switzerland) and it technically was part of the HRE for quite a while too, these can be counted as Austria and Germany respectively
I suppose also hear about the kingdoms that preceeded the national states like the Kingdom of Bavaria and the Großherzogtum (Grand Dutchy
) of Baden (now Germany) and the Kingdom of Milan (I think that's what it was called) (now Italy), as well as the Roman Empire if you go back far enough which we could technically also count as Italy
But I don't know in what order they'd be, you'd probably even learn quite a lot about Liechtenstein
If I had to mention a non-neighbor, it might be Russia
Most would be:
\- Germany
\- France
\- Italy
\- Austria
My list would have the same countries but in a different order:
France, because of Napolionic Wars, the Helvetic Republic, Liberal vs Conservatives --> Sonderbundskrieg and founding of the current Swiss state
Austria (HRE), I'd put Austria in second place because it (the HRE under Austrian control) plays a big role in the Swiss mythology (1291, Tell) and played a role in the founding of the Swiss state as *the* conservative nation between Napoleon and the Vienna Conference
Germany, big neighbour and huge cultural influence, also two World Wars
(Note: I'm from the German part of Switzerland, but I'd still put France first)
Italy, neigbour, cultural infuence
USA, Swiss people emigrated to the US, we copied much of their democratic ideas into our democratic system
I would put Germany first because of the meaningfullness of swiss reformation with Zwingli and Calvin
And I know the pre march rebellion came up first in France, but because Napoleon lll
I think it's context in Germany was more important for Switzerland, since Switzerland became afterwards a beacon of democracy for other german countries
Not in every game
Except if you want to argue that the biggest trading places on Steam (TF2/CSGO) are both scams
CS:GO only got free 2 play like a year or two ago
Before it cost 15$.
Tbf, CSGO never did it as scummily as all other games
Yes, they're "lootboxes", but nobody ever complained about them before the EA fiasco
I think it's pretty unfair putting them into the same basket
In fact, those third party sites were taken down by Valve, at least those dealing with betting skins for money / skins I believe
There's still some smaller ones up, and if it's big, it's only skins for money now
So the same as CS:GO, kinda
The EU in a 100 years
The EU will be going from one crisis to another, without ever breaking up or federalising- because that's just how things work in Brussels
Meanwhile the press will be clamouring about populism, despite them continuously rising and falling in most countries, just at different times
Inequalities between Western and Eastern Europe will have decreased, with the population of the latter one eventually stabilising, but Southern Europe will completely crash and experience a severe economic crunch as the weight of mounting debt, ageing and falling population, a German economy next door in need of millions of workers and a lack of enough globally competitive companies will become insurmountable
An interesting question mark remains on who the biggest European country will be - will Germany really be overpassed by the UK and then France before the end of the century
Globally, the EU will never become the next superpower, falling to below 4% of the world's population by 2100 and with an economy that has a hard time growing
That, together with it's internal political divergences, means the EU will be, internationally, a slightly bigger Brazil in 100 years
I think 100 years might just be barely in time to achieve federalisation of the EU and implementation of a widespread quasi-communist (although it wont be called such) post-scarcity economy fueled by asteroid mining and AI
Private enterprise will still exist, but most things that can't be serviced with said factors have been slowly wound down due to unprofitability due to collapsing resource prices
But of course things like fashion houses, everything related to art, some of the more innovative, less infrastructure-y tech companies etc
will still be privately owned

Well yes, that's obvious
For Germans, the EU is more than just a politico-economic union, it's an integral part of their answer to a post-WW2 Germany, it's worldview and it's identity
And then there are 26 other countries in the Union, and a couple more outside the EU too, every single one of whom lack this overwhelming sense of a national re-collection / self-imposed need to redeem themselves
The ~~C~~CCP, maybe
I think Central Asia is growing
Central Asia reestablishing the USSR and "inviting" Russia would be far from the wackiest thing that happened in history
French pro-EU sentiments is not comparable to the connection within the German people's national conscience between the EU and the end of the Third Reich
> (I’ve seen many people saying that you guys also don’t want to stop coal mining and it’s not fair that it’s required from us)
I though most Poles didn't like migrants
Yes, but English
Not in 100 years
Try 1000
Low Saxon died out because it didn't have any real actors (and I don't mean NGOs or cultural clubs, I mean state-level actors like a proper government) pushing for its use
And no, being "officially recognised" doesn't count
History has shown time and time again that the only way to permanently guarantee language survival is if the ethnolinguistic region in question is internally self-governing*. We Swiss try to keep Romansh (which doesn't have its own sub-state) alive at all costs (we are far from monolinguist supremacists), and while I wouldn't say it's dying, it's negatively stagnating despite us doing everything "right". This wouldn't be the case if Rhaetia had been an independent state for 1000 years
\* I don't mean to say the Netherlands couldn't be internally self-governing within the EU
Clearly the Netherlands is an established state, and as I said, if it happens due to being part of a bigger EU, it happens maybe over 500-1000+ years
Yes
those are unimaginable timescales
There was an episode of a regular talkshow once where they had some guys over
Topic was youth violence and so they had everything from 'normal' everyday school kids, the criminal immigrant up the hells angels
There are at least 10 memes that stem from this 1h long show
Everybody (at least in the german speaking part of Switzerland) knows this and you hear some sentences recited all the time in everyday life
Because it's funny
So yeah not a picture meme but rather multiple quotes (usually on how much of a gangster you are, how stupid/non gangster/childish the opponent is and similar) that actually get used IRL pretty frequently
We usually show this to new additions to our friend group if they didn't grow up in Switzerland
Just to educate them in a fun way and so they too get those inside jokes everybody has been using for the past 20 years
We also got other meme quotes from TV shows but they're just really random stuff
Definitely Lichtenstein
They use our currency and our military would defend them in case of an invasion
Switzerland also diplomatically represents Lichtenstein in other countries
Edit: They also speak a Swiss German dialect
I would say Liechtenstein since it really doesn't even feel like it's a different country
They use the Swiss currency, have the same phone numbers, same phone providers, their dialect is similar to the bordering region in Switzerland, their licence plates are like the Swiss licence plates but with white text on black background and the letters FL (for Fürstentum Liechtenstein) instead of the abbreviation for a canton
Liechtenstein feels more like a loosely attached small 27th canton (even most cantons are bigger) than like a separate country
When the borders closed in Europe due to the coronavirus, the border between Switzerland and Liechtenstein remained open while all the others closed
With this 'little brother' nation covered, we now have the 'big brother'. This isn't the same country for all of Switzerland since not everyone speaks the same language
So it's just the country where your language is also spoken (doesn't exist for our 4th language): For Ticino it's Italy, for the Romandie it's France, and for the rest it's Germany (our German is very different but we write in standard German so it still counts), more than Austria
I suppose this is because it's quite hard to get to Austria because the entire border is mountainous so there are only two routes you can use if you want to go to Austria
The border with Germany however is just along the Rhine River (more or less) in relatively flat territory
Also Germany is way bigger
None really
Germany and France are of course close to us in some ways but in some ways hey're also definitely not
Plus, Germans and French know very little about Switzerland although Swiss people know a lot about Germany and France, so the relationship feels very unequal
If I had to pick one, I'd say Japan
Switzerland and Japan are in many ways quite similar despite the vast geographic distance in between
Both our mentalities as well as the way we perceive our country in the context of the international community has many parallels
Japan is also the only country that has ever been genuinely interested in Swiss culture without displaying a condescending attitude at the same time
Probably Liechtenstein and Austria
It's not just he language (German speaking part of Switzerland), but also the 'mountain culture' I would say
And we accidentally invaded them a couple of times, so they basically belong to us now
Hug me, brotha
I agree, I did a cultural exchange in Japan and it was very interesting how much most Japanese people actually know about us
(they don't know much of course, but it's relatively impressive)
I totally agree about the part about Japanese people being interested in our culture or country in general without being condescending
There is (well, was because of the virus) a tonne of Japanese tourists here and they are so nice and pleasent
Compared to tourists from let's say France to pick a neighbouring country, they don't act superior but curious and interested
A tourist from France, especially the ones with lots of money or that come from a place like Paris, will tend to say things like "Comme c'est pittoresque" or "Comme c'est original" which are very condescending phrases
(Not all French tourists of course but you get what I'm saying)
They don‘t have their own military anymore
We basically share our military with them
So they technically can’t invade us
It isn’t that big of a deal
They’re neutral too and I feel like militarily Switzerland and Lichtenstein basically are one country (and have been for a long time) since we have a common military
We don't really see it as "another" country
At least I don't. They are very close to us, they use our currency, our post stamps and we even speak the same language
When I grew up my parents always made it clear to me that people in our country may be different (different languages and cultures) but that we are all swiss for the same reason
I still see Liechtenstein as a part of this
We basically consider them the "27th Swiss Canton" (canton = state)
The main reason they never joined Switzerland is probably that they have a monarchy, which obviously wouldn't be possible to keep
And they're doing great with the current arrangements, so why change a system that works
We leave again afterwards ;)
Yeah I met a lot of people from Liechtenstein during university and I was never be able to tell until they told me themselves
And I keep forgetting they aren't Swiss
Pour avoir eu une ex Française, j'ai entendu pas mal de trucs sur les Suisses
Mais c'est vrai qu'on est pas mieux
Mais dans mon commentaire je parlais juste des touristes, pas forcément d'autres situations
\*sad Swiss noises\*
Now you're a bit harsh, Switzerland is not *that* isolated
It is, but not as much as you said
But generally you're right, a big part of the culture of Switzerland is not being like Germany/France/Italy
We *want* to be distinct from our neighbours
We (Swiss-Germans) look at Germany like a big brother in whose shadow we are
Sometimes it is even a bit frustration and distrust
This is a reason why we would relate to Austria, which, to our *understanding*, is in a similar situation like us
I'm not sure how it is for the French and Italian speaking part, but I believe at least for the French-speaking part there is a similar sentiment towards France
From our neighbouring countries I like Germany the most
They are nearly the only one who take us seriously in European and international matters
The French say it is our own fault we are isolated and don't really want to help, the Italians have their own problems and Austria is too small to really do anything
In the negotiation for the bilateral treaty with the EU, Germany often is on our side, while the EU has a similar sentiment like France towards us
L'espagnol, l'italien, le portugais, pas trop de probleme a comprendre ces langues
Et puis bon, je triche un peu, j'ai etudie l'espagnol et l'italien au gymnase
La comprehension de l'allemand par contre
C'est une autre histoire
C'est seulement parce que j'ai du etudier l'allemand a l'ecole que je peux comprendre un mot sur deux, et encore

I would turn the white cross into a circle and then do some kind of black cross in the mid - wait no

It is ultra-symmetric
I let the people from [r/grouptheory/] decide on [how symmetric]
Especially the proportions
The government gives me 300 CHF a month per kid as an allowance
Do they know about it
They're toddlers
One could interpret that as rent
When I started my apprenticeship my parents asked me to pay 10% of my salary to help cover the expenses like food, rent etc
We were an average middle class family
I know of other young people who had to financially contribute
It's not unheard of, but I don't think it's usual everywhere and in every family
After I finished my education and got a fulltime job, I set up a fixed amount (CHF 500
-) that goes straight to my parents each month
It's not much, considering rent, food, internet access, etc would cost me much more if I lived alone
I always saw it as a compensation for the obligatory basic health care
My mom kept receiving the same money even though I moved out almost three years ago and pay for almost everything myself (because I'm still at uni, so they technically are still required to finanfially look out for me)
My parents pay my health care which is roughly the same amount
Yeah, it depends a lot on the family
It's common enough to not be weird, but not as common as to assume it's the rule
I pay about 3k a month for daycare
That's why
School is literally the cheapest part of having a child in Switzerland
Everything else is what's expensive
They might be higher but everything is more expensive so that balances out
really weird drunk german according to a german friend
Are you describing Swiss German
Bruh, I have learned Swedish
Danish is a throat condition
and romansh, yeah
no, but swiss german do sound kinda weird i suppose
France
For their revolution
It's what's set us up to be the country we are today
Thank you Germany for almost always siding with Switzerland in international/EU matter
Thanks Germany for not invading us in WW2
Except if you're Swiss
Nobody ain't got something to thank the Swiss for it seems
Edit : Thanks for the thanks guys o/ I appreciate it
Now I have "Fighters in exile" of Sabaton in my head
> Fighter pilots in exile fly over foreign land
>Let their story be heard, tell of 303rd
>Fighter pilots from Poland in the battle of Britain
>Guarding the skies of the isle
*That's* the biggest thanks you could imagine
Not, you know, them being the reason you're being independent (they lent their navy to destroy the British's, fyi)
Stalin did that
Wow
talk about two sides of a coin with that guy
Same
> and no one hates
Well, back in the day there was this [Gadaffi] guy because we arrested his son
But you see [where] hate towards Switzerland gets you (sarcasm)
Edit : But thanks for that compliment, not everything's perfect though as we are quite foreigner opposed sadly
I hope it'll be gone one day
Uhm
CERN, red cross, geneva convention just to name a few
Also, some thanked for food
Swiss chocolate and cheese comes to mind
We do stuff, it just gets buried I suppose
Well, I doubted that Sabaton could put all squadrons in a single song, but thanks for clearing it up
Sabaton also mentions the squadrons of other countries (Czechoslovakia and Canada I believe)
To be fair, you did kind of force them to become communist states and caused the iron curtain
I doubt that us being a middleman didn't help a lot in the negotiations
I doubt that anything of that significance would've happened without one
And about CERN, well you're right I suppose
I'm not saying we shouldn't be grateful, but today's Germany's relationship with Poland outweighs the relationship to the USSR in WW2
Germany isn't fascist anymore mate
This is not a talk Russia vs
NATO
Please don't turn it into one, especially as I couldn't give less fucks as I'm Swiss and we're not even in NATO
If you want to argue, do it about the actual topic on hand and not some NATO vs Russia crap
Yes, I always lock my doors when I am at home

Probably the ETH  for natural sciences, other than that it doesn't really matter I guess
(Basel is the oldest tho)
The Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich (ETH Zürich)
It roughly translates to federal technological college zürich
If i remember it correctly it is also because Einstein used to teach there or maybe he was studying there while developing his famous theory of relativity
Edit: Einstein studied there
(And he actually was a good student)
After that he worked in Bern at the Swiss patent office, and during that time developed his theory of relativity
Thanks u/JimSteak
In terme of prestige, it's certainly ETH Zurich
Gallen also holds a high reputation for its business school
i’d say Uni SG is famous for it’s economics and law courses but that might just be the stereotypes, idk
Einstein studied there

Ahh yess, forgot HSG for economics
I'm not rivh enough to go there  (stereotypical the university for rich lawyer-sons, there's tons of memes)
haha yeah, i’m just not interested in economics so idk much about the different unis that offer these courses except HSG from the memes
I don't know but I always forget that Moldova exists
It's just there
I don't hear or see anything about it, not in the news, not in movies, not anywhere
The only thing I know about it is that O-Zone (the group who made the Numa Numa song) is from there
Switzerland is so boring, it has a whole sub dedicated to proving it doesn't exist: r/SwitzerlandIsFake
I only think of Moldova when it's Eurovision time
Interestingly I feel that way with the sea, Lanzarote for example: the seais beautiful but without any other interesting landscape it's just

Dead body reported
How are you talking about our landscape tiddies
Country officials and employees are quite clean, especially compared to other countries
Sure, we get the occasional regional favoritism and we have a lot of politicians who work on the board of directors of large corporations but that is not secret and usually communicated well enough
Being home to many large international corporations and organizations, corruption is more often seen with influential positions there
Think FIFA or some UN figures of questionable reputation
Big corporations sure have some issues, but most arise working outside the country and don't really affect us much here
At least this is my perception
I can't really remember the exact words of my father, but wasn't it like that, you only got flats, especially in bigger, left leaning cities, if you were an SPÖ member or at least supporter
I'd say that's kind of corruption
Well explained
I feel like we swiss people are not really good at music
But hey, we still have DJ Bobo: [
Zurich, not a huge city, expensive as hell,very clean, safest city iv ever seen
hear english just as much as german when you walk around downtown,estimates are about 50% of the city are foreigners
Bern, Switzerland: Apparently we have 200k inhabitants, it feels more like a village sometimes
I can walk home from any party or bar
I keep meeting people I know unexpectedly when I go anywhere
The city is more chilled than any other I know
People are reaaaalllllyyyy relaxed
Do you live in Thessaloniki
Well my Athenian friend claims that everyone in Thessaloniki is crazy but maybe this is just Athenian propaganda
I think Athens is very nice but also kinda not, depending on where you are
It has clearly been better though (a few millenia ago)
Since I'm a big fan of trains (and I also care about the environment), I'd absolutely love for Europe to build one big, interconnected system of high-speed trains
I understand that some countries already have such trains but what I'm looking for is a unified network: the trains would all look the same and they would be owned/maintained by one public company
There would be a European fonds where each country would be required to pay into
The money would be used to build and maintain the infrastructure across the continent, so that you won't be able to feel much of a quality difference
Train stations for this particular high speed train would look just as nice and modern in, say, Ukraine, as they would in France
Architects and engineers should take inspiration from Japan and South Korea, where the high speed networks look super nice, clean and ultra-modern
The European network would make it possible to traverse long distances without having to get off and change in between
For example I'm envisioning a direct connection between Lisbon and Moscow or Palermo and Hammerfest (of course there would be stops in between for people to get on/off)
I know it's a bit utopian but you told us to think big, so yeah, this would be pretty awesome
Edit: By "high-speed" I mean somewhere around the 400 km/h mark
This would get you from Lisbon to Moscow in roughly 12 hours (disregarding stops in between) or from Athens to Hammerfest in roughly the same amount of time
Nuclear power plants to cover 100% demand
We should stop wasting resources on renewables, it goes nowhere
I interpret the question as a pure fantasy wish, because of that I raise your suggestion to a **maglev** network
This
Although the train network in most of Europe is already pretty good
I travel regularly between Zürich and Warsaw and I always take train
Just before the pandemic hir I was on vacation in northern Finland, all the way from Zürich and back by train (and a bit by ferry)
You can get almost everywhere on the contingent by train
Flying is no fun
I think the idea was that each station gets a similar budget
I do agree that it would be cool for each country to have their own style station or something
I would argue that modern-looking buildings can be well-integrated into a historical cityscape *if done right*. A good example is the opera in Hamburg
It is very modern-looking and surrounded by historical buildings but somehow the architects (Herzog & DeMeuron) managed to fit it in really nicely
Besides, our cities are being continuously mixed up with more modern looking buildings anyway
I mean, I absolutely love that 18th and 19th century architecture but we're not in the 18th or 19th century anymore, so it would be a bit strange to build like that
Zurich now has a skyscraper with glass facades amidst all the historical buildings
When construction finished 15 years ago or so, people were complaining how it's going to destroy the cityscape but in the meantime, most inhabitants have come to like the new tower
And they STILL open new coal plants (at least one this year, that basically balances a nuclear plant closed down few weeks earlier)
>Yeah travelling by train is so much easier and more comfortable than travelling by car or plane
I would go further than that and say it's genuinely enjoyable
Travelling across Europe by train is an experience I hope everyone gets to enjoy once in their lifetime
Imagine selling it like this:
*We've been working on this concept
Like a theme park ride, but much bigger
And instead of mock attractions, you get to ride through real world landscapes and cities with people in it
*You'll ride in roomy carriages, sheltered from the weather, with huge windows right by your seat
The ride will even have a fully fledged restaurant on it, as well as restrooms
*In a matter of hours you'll encounter vastly different landscapes and cities
From plains to forests, across rivers, valleys and montains
There will be small villages and towns, as well as large urban areas
*The languages you see will change, as will the architecture
Crossing international borders will be completely hassle-free, you won't even have to leave the ride
*You can even go on the ride overnight, and sleep in your own little bunk bed, and get breakfast in the morning
If you wake up at night, you might find that you crossed into an entirely different country, and look out into the streets of an unfamiliar city in a far away land
*Or you might open the window, and catch that unmistakable smell of a warm summer night somewhere in rural Italy
This so much

There are some photos and reports if you scroll my post history back to February
Flying is no fun
Yes
Unfortunately, the thing is, you cannot have all three:
stable energy supply
no new fossil fuel deployments
phase out of nuclear
you need to give one up
Giving up (1
) is a no go
So given the choice of (2
) and (3
) Germany chose 3
The best option in my opinion is to go via Basel and Berlin
You depart at 9am from Zürich and you are in Warsaw around 10pm
The problem is that the change in Berlin is rather tight
However, Deutsche Bahn will sell you a single ticket for the whole trip, so if the train to Berlin is delayed, it's their problem not yours
Thanks to the EU passenger rights regulations they need to offer you accommodation, and pay you some compensation for the delay
There is also a similar connection the other way
You leave Warsaw at 8:30am or something like that, change in Berlin, and you are in Zürich around 11pm
If you like night trains, there is NightJet from Zürich to Berlin
So you depart in the evening, have comfortable night on train (the rhytmic sound of a train makes me sleep really well), and in Berlin you catch the first train to Warsaw
Another option is to go via Vienna or Bratislava
There is direct RailJet from Zürich to Bratislava (or at list there was one before the pandemic messed up everything)
The problems are that you either have a very short change (and you cannot buy a single ticket, so if you miss your connection, the railways won't help you out), or you stay overnight there
That's where Bratislava comes in – hotels there are significantly less expensive than in Vienna
As for countries: on Berlin route you only cross two borders: CH->DE->PL
But on the Bratislava route, there are seven borders: CH->LI->AT->DE->AT->SK->CZ->PL
The train doesn't stop in LI and DE, but goes through their territories
We're on the same page
It's not an extremely known joke, but I've seen a few memes where it says that the entire canton of Jura isn't actually real, as pretty much no one knows people from Jura
There’s this sub r/Switzerlandisfake
But outside of reddit I don’t think we have one, at least not here in the french speaking part
If you admit that you are from Bielefeld, you've got more problems than arguing with people over its existence
I know more people from Liechtenstein than from Jura, while I've never been to Liechtenstein but I'm pretty sure I've been to Jura
> Making reference to a Bürgersprach – the equivalent of a US town hall meeting – she had attended in Bielefeld, she said: “...so es denn existiert” – “if it even exists”. “Ich hatte den Eindruck, ich war da”, she said – “I had the impression I was there
I hope I can go back”; “Ich hoffe, ich darf wieder hinfahren”.

I mean, while not part of the "new" Switzerland, Napoleon still had rule over Switzerland for an amount of time
So everyone would be called Napoleon
Nice
Isn't the Kingdom of Italy technically the Duchy of Savoy
Napoleon didn't rule directly he just initiated the Helvetic Republic and and when that didnt work he "helped" us to form a new order
So the government was still our own during those times
We just had his sword in our back
Ahh, got it
Misremembered it then
Until the German Empire was ended in 1918, the Kingdom of Prussia was the German Empire
[Source]
But technically we were part of some larger German Monarchies and the frankish
So for example I think we were part of Charlemagnes rule
Theoretically, yes
But as it happens Switzerland before the modern state was divided into own republics
For example, Bern was a Free Imperial city (until the end of the 17th century) after the extinction of the Zähringer House
So, there wasn't some parasitic prince inbetween; Bern was supposed to pay their taxes directly to the emperor
"Supposed" bcs whom to pay your taxes to, if it is not clear who the real emperor was

In Switzerland, there's a motorway where construction started in 1970
In 1975, a first section of the motorway was completed - and then all works stopped, since a commission was reevaluating the motorways
There was some local protests against the project, as well
So for a few miles there was an empty motorway running sometimes directly parallel to local roads
Here are [some] [old] [pictures]
Eventually, in 2001, the further extension of the motorway got approved again, and the complete motorway finally opened in 2009
The redesign of our bills

You can on interrail :) If you are traveling across few countries, it is usually the best option
But otherwise, I agree
For example, I can book a single ticket Zurich-Warsaw via Berlin
But if I want to go via Vienna or Bratislava, I need to book separate tickets
To make it worse: it is impossible to book the Bratislava-Warsaw ticket online
You need to go the the counter, and ask for it in Slovak
(I managed to do that in Polish, but English was no go
Any Slovaks reading this: please explain)
OTOH, you cannot buy a single ticket [Szczytno-Kwidzyn] Last time I tried, I had to buy three separate tickets in three different counters
**THREE**. I don't know if I would be successful without being able to speak Polish
I somehow doubt it
So being able to book a single ticket from Switzerland to Poland online is sorta surprising
They are working on that: [ And apparently locals don't like it: [
Ooooh, thank you for the hints about buying tickets online
Very appreciated, I'll give it a try next time
Almost :) Your gauge is 4mm wider than Russian (1524mm vs
1520mm)
That's because Russia changed their standard at some point to be more "metric", while Finnish is still imperial (exactly 5ft)
That means that trains aren't fully compatible, but it is possible to build trains that can ride both, so Helsinki-St Petersburg trains don't need to switch locos at the gauge break
BTW, you have really cool trains up there
I took the Kolari-Helsinki night train back in February
The powerful diesel locos in frozen arctic create the feeling of taking a Real Train
It's used often enough but typically reserved for people that report miniscule parking violations to the police or call the police on you for noise disturbance at 22:01

Idk if it's Germany-specific but you maybe know the type

Man do I love my country
Also: The Battlefield games are Swedish
Oh my, the perks of being an adult: anticipated games just coming out while life happens
Thanks for the heads up, bro
I'd like to thank Liechtenstein for being just straight up awesome
Sparing us in ww2
Jokes aside,
Italy: thank you for teaching this country that we deserve nice food
Germany: thanks for being our big brother and the perfect country for school trips
France: thanks for giving us swiss italian speakers the swiss french speakers, which we can to some degree relate with
Liechtenstein: thanks for forgiving us when our soldiers invade you by mistake during drills
Austria: thanks for letting all of our disputes be forgotten and being a good alpine friend
Wholesome content
You guys tried multiple times
It's not that unknown, but Rivella is pretty good (I think they have it in Luxembourg and the Netherlands as well)
We also have Flauder
It tastes s bit like sweet flowers
Himml I also kinda like
Is Sinalco sold outside of Switzerland
Esta Thé isn't really know outside of Italy and Switzerland I think
And it's f**king good
It's a shame you can't find the gressini/Nutella/EstaThé pack outside of Italy anymore
Turns out it's much more common outside pf Switzerland than I thought, oops
I completely forgot about Sinalco, it's sold outside of Switzerland as well but in Switzerland it's distributed by Ramseier Suisse
While it is indeed in the sugary side of things, it's one of the only that actually tastes like there's tea in it
Never seen Malzbier in Switzerland
But I've seen it in Ecuador and Cuba
I always try to play games in english
Just because germans translate things so weird and awful
For example
In the new animal crossing there are the two racoons tommy and timmy
You know how theyre called in german
PLEPP & SCHLEPP
Why
Whats so bad about timmy and tommy
Its so stupid at times
And also the voice acting is sometimes better in english
For example TF2 has so shit german voiceactors
The sound horrible
Like every character was voiced by one guy
And in english the voice acting is just so magnificent
99% of the time in English
I only choose French if the dub is better and/or of the  dub has voices from my childhood
Case on point: any Batman games
I would love to be able to speak more languages (fluently)
Especially French, as I learned it for years in school but could never speak it properly
If I could speak 40 languages fluently I would probably still think it's not enough
Absolutely, I feel comfortable speaking two (plus Swiss german dialect), and I can speak some Italian and French
But for the latter two it's barely enough to get around and my abilities should be better, considering that I've learned both languages in  school (same is true for Latin, but let's ignore that one for now)
I'm currently in the process of re-learning Italian, through an online language course and my lifetime goal is to be able to fluently speak all four national languages of Switzerland
In case I'll achieve that in a reasonable time (I doubt it), I'd would love to learn Irish as I find it an exceptionally beautiful language
At 17 i was able to speak 4 languages (B1+) and only when i met some foreigners in a language school in France, i realised that it was a lot
I still want to learn even more languages
I feel like the ones i already speak are only a foundation and nothing special
I feel the same about German so I understand
Probably the [explosion at Mitholz] (Wikipedia article in German) in 1947
Technically it was multiple explosions as it was an entire ammunition depot that burned
It destroyed the entire village of Mitholz, collapsed the whole mountain side in which it was built, killed 9 and injured 7 people
Because the fire initially caused a row of smaller explosions that were heard and seen in Mitholz the people had time to evacuate, without that the death toll would have been much higher
Edit: [Before] and [after] pictures of the mountain side
I literally made myself some warm milk to drink after school today
My family loves milk, my brother used to drink a litre of it a day and we always use it for breakfast
In Swiss German, "im Cacao/Caco" is often used for a particularly remote area
Sometimes the fictitious place "Hintertupfigen" is also used
If it is supposed to be particularly far away, it's often Honolulu
"Au trou du cul du monde" - the ass hole of the world, in French
We have a lot of wine too, aswell as we were/are also racist especially in ww2 when we denied entrance for jewish refugees
Germany gets all the jew hater fame
And the whole world measures screen size in inches
Everyone is a hypocrite
Everytime I'm in Italy the intial greeting seems to be "Prego". Which I guess you could say is even more polite
This is starting to become an odd competition lol: Heey we hated the Jews too
Why do the German gets all the credits
Bonjour
Is this only you or do Portugese and Brazilians not intermingle on the internet
The US and the UK are a special case, as there are lots of L2 speakers that are on English language websites
But I know how it is for German and there, each country has of course their own websites, especially for politics but for other topics, the websites are often not country specific (e.g. gaming or other hobbies)
You also can see this here on reddit where there are country specific subreddits but /r/de is the main German speaking channel for everybody speaking German and not only Germany
Which BTW often leads to interesting small cultural clashes
As others have pointed out, skyscrapers and old towns dating back to medieval times generally don't mix
The US on the other hand did not have such old towns, so I guess it was easier to sacrifice buildings that were only 100-200 years old for a skyscraper
the thing is we don't want a skyline except maybe one like this
most of us don't like or outright reject and despise modern architecture
but now imagine a skyscraper or even several in a place like this
I think it only works when you do it like in Paris and basically build an entire new city far away from the historic city (la dèfense) or to a certain degree like in London or Berlin where due to war damage there are already a lot of modern buildings inbetween so if you've already got a lot of contrasting styles you might as well just fully embrace it (London does it a lot better though imo)

Par chez nous on dit "caché ou pas, j’arrive". (Hidden or not, here I come)
I'm coming
I think that rarely ever happens, most germans (or austrians) i know who moved to switzerland kept their vocabulary and accent
Tbh, i think it sounds wierd if people only copy the vocabulary and not the accent
And since we all understand each other anyways there’s not really a point in changing
Its different however if you as a swiss person speaking swiss german go abroad to germany or austria
We have some words adopted from french  (example: Bicycle: German = Fahrrad, Swiss german = Velo, Wallet: German = Brieftasche, Swiss german = portemonnaie)
So for us we have to adapt if people want to fully understand us
I wouldn't mind, but French people usually use Swiss French words to mock us, not to adapt
They don't even bother using our numbers when coming here
Sometimes I hear ppl in Germany trying to make the swiss dialect and they always mess it up
It sounds so cringey
It's sad
With my experience, I would have to disagree
I've worked with many French people and have a few Belgian and French friends in my social groups, and they really tried to use our words, especially the numbers
Even 80, which can be used either way in Switzerland
There is obviously some mocking when they discover a new swiss word they hadn't heard before, but I mean, I do the same with words from other cantons or countries
I live in Lausanne, perhaps in other places or social circles it's different
iirc the French changed to the "four twenties ten" stuff later, Belgians and Swiss still say "septante, huitante, nonante" for 70, 80 and 90, a bit like in other latin languages or even English
Maybe I was just unlucky and met the wrong people, but the majority were line that
Usually wealthy tourists coming on vacation in Valais so maybe that's why they felt superior, because they came in zje mountain in a more rural area
Ah, tourists
Yes, I assume they may be nastier than immigrants, definitely
Oh yes, immigrants always (at least in my experience) try to fit in as much as possible while not forgetting their origins
As it should be
I've been an immigrant in other countries half my life, and I always do my best to blend with the locals, and I've only ever had good experiences :)
And I am myself the son of an immigrant family (my mom and her side of the family) I always enjoy different cultures and I can't wait to travel again !
**Germany:** The staring
Oh the staring
Also, the constant need to be in front of other cars when driving is also a bit odd to me
(Meaning: Let's say I'm in the autobahn, going 135 on the rightmost lane
Car behind me will overtake me and then slow down to 130
You'll see another car do likewise to him/her, and this continues on and on)
**France:** The incessant complaining, specially when it doesn't pertain to them
Example
Compared to Switzerland, neighboring France had much more stringent quarantine measures due to the COVID-19 virus
Government officials from the French regions bordering Switzerland were complaining that the Swiss weren't under the same strict measures and that it was unfair
To which a Swiss Government official clapped back with a statement implying "cultural differences" between the residents of both countries
**Italy:** All the irrational rules some people have with food
Example : Italian coworker of mine says she doesn't eat Asian noodle dishes that contain meat because in Italy you don't eat them together
But seafood is okay because that's normal in Italy
So she is okay eating Shrimp Pad Thai but won't eat Beef Pad Thai
HUH
Likewise, drinking a cappuccino in the afternoon
Faux pas
I just can‘t understand why all of our neighbouring countries went to war over something
Just stay neutral folks
Thought of a few more
Wanted to get the scoop from locals as to where to eat in Firenze, so I asked a kind looking Italian man if he recommended a good place to eat
Looks at me
Dead pan serious
"la casa di mia mamma
" And no he wasn't inviting us over, he was just postulating for who knows why
By the way, this isn't the first time I've heard that answer
A lot of Italians answer the same way
Why
How is that of any help
Probably just cheaper
Our german subsidiary still refuses to give up Fax
I frequent r/soccer, and their disdain for non-English people being fans of English teams is unbearable to me
The delightfully labelled "PLASTICS".
IIRC they built their railway with a wider gauge to make it harder for invading armies to use them
I agree
But I think she means larger chunks of meat (specially chicken), not meat sauces/pastas
But it's not just her, I've been scolded (sometimes jokingly/other times passive aggressively) by Italian friends/coworkers/waiters for things that I did't even know were rules
Some other examples
+ No cheese on seafood dishes
Asked for some Parmigiano to put on my Spaghetti Alle Vongole
You shouldn't do that
+ Want to put hot sauce on ANY pasta/pizza
You shouldn't do that
+ Want to eat pizza with your hands at a restaurant
You shouldn't do that
List goes on
Another example
Was driving through a small road with my French colleague and he went off about how a tree has collapsed on the road and no one has cleared it up for days
Lo and behold, we get to that part of the road and cars are queued up driving around the tree
The tree was probably 20 cm in diameter, and could be dragged off the road quite easily
Me: "Why
don't you just clear it yourself
I mean
we can do it now if you'd like
Him: "That's the job of the mairie, not mine
Me: F' me
Until you're no longer the first
That's my point
I live in the Swiss-French portion of Switzerland
But wouldn't surprise me if what you wrote it true
Regarding the nose picking
Maybe something of that region as well
Here it's coughing and sneezing without trapping it that gets of my nerves
Specially in public transport (pre Corona Virus)
I've been to small Portuguese stores/restaurants that didn't accept card payments or any note larger than 50 EUR
Mairie is town hall/local admin office for those that may not know
Plastics are resented all over, but at least on r/soccer the British are obnoxious about it
I'm talking, they will look through you profile/comment history to find out where you live to call you a plastic
Which is the irony (to me) considering this is being written on reddit
It's happened to me multiple times
Just let people like whatever they want to like
Lol my Portuguese colleague cuts up his spaghetti into tiny pieces (like long grains of rice)
I thought my Italian friend was gonna have an aneurysm
People in New Zealand LOVE putting "tomato sauce" on pizza
I like the sentiment of your reply, but it's honestly hilariously pretentious, and you sound like the coworker I was talking about
Why I don't buy it at all
She claims all this mumbo jumbo about delicacy, simplicity, tradition, and blah blah, just like you did
But we went out for sushi because she was gushing about how she LOVES sushi
Guess what she orders
Sushi rolls that are deep fried, covered in Mayonnaise and teriyaki sauce, served with mango and avocado, and just generally look like Tekashi69
Not to mention bathes them in soy sauce/fake wasabi
Oooh sushi
That's when I realized some people are full of sh
t, and don't really know what they believe
Mine is having to eat carbs and proteins separately
That's how they were meant to be eaten
(imo)
Think I know what you mean
I had similar experiences on the portions of the autobahn without speed limits, where I'm overtaking cars (using the left most lane), going an insane 170+. But from my rear view mirror I see another car quickly approaching using the left lane exclusively
Soon enough you hear the roar of an engine, and I have to quickly step aside to let a AMG/Porsche type car fly past me at what has to be at least 220+.
My car shakes/trembles as it passes
By the way
> Fish + cheese just doesn't go together
I take it you've never tried the gloriousness that is a Filet-O-Fish
Bruh
They call ketchup tomato sauce
I'm pulling your leg
I'm saying one can't be pretentious about one cuisine (usually their own), and then hold the complete opposite opinion/views on another
In my coworker's case
Sushi
"Pineapple on pizza is an abomination
But mango in a sushi roll is A-MA-ZING
It's the same basic principle, is what I'm saying
On that note, I absolutely adore Greek seafood dishes
But Mydia Saganaki
Sorry
adding some hot sauce on them
That's how I like it
You're missing the point
I'm not saying Italian palates are pretentious
I'm saying it's pretentious to gatekeep Italian food (or any food) as something that can only be eaten this way, with this combination of ingredients, at this hour of the day
WHILE, being completely oblivious of the same for other cuisines
It's pretentious to claim Italian fish dishes are delicate and can only be served this particular way, and on the other side asking that your Japanese fish dish be marinated in Mayonnaise, sugar and soy sauce and have it be served by someone that will make a volcano out of an onion and a heart shape with the fried rice
Hope that makes more sense
It's like you didn't even read what I wrote
Speaking of being pretentious
Disagreeing
Not at all
Claiming your own response is "eloquently" written
Kind of
But then again, you are THE "Talented Time Traveler". So apologies for my shortcomings
In Switzerland, *bostitch* is used as the generic word for a stapler
Also Babyfon, Bobbycar, Carrerabahn, Föhn, Jeep, Labello, Whirlpool, Aspirin, Pampers
probably a lot more
Man, in Switzerland it's just "Klebstreifen" ("Chläbstreife")
wait
föhn is a brand
It never occurd to me how awesome Drachenviereck actually sounds
Hell yeah, geometry
Older British man upon stumbling upon the queues for immigration in a foreign country (One for nationals and one for foreigners)
Where do I bloody stand
I'm neither Moroccan or a Foreigner
Well, they wouldn't see themselves as foreigners if they invaded 1/3 of the world
I can confirm tourists have a death wish
Every winter there’s news of some tourist dying or almost dying in the Alps because they ignored safety warnings, like hiking or skiing in an area marked with high avalanche danger, thinking they don’t need a guide to climb a mountain or a glacier, or that they can still do it with the wrong equipment or under bad weather
The mountains can be dangerous, don’t go out there thinking you know better and that it won’t happen to you anyway
Family friend of ours was visiting the Seven Sisters and was asked by a young Korean tourist to take a picture of her "jumping" (not off the cliff but up/down)
She slipped and fell to her death
Horrible
Wait wat
Are Americans shitting money or are houses just that cheap
> you disagree with
I don't think it's a simple disagreement
I've never heard of it and I'm from Switzerland
Wait wat
Now I know why Americans feel like they need a gun to protect them, the intruder can come in from everywhere
Never heard of but that's cool
Would you recommend it for tourism ? I may come to Hamburg some day :)
No, that doesn't exist in Switzerland
Bern is not actually that important of a city if it weren't for the capital
It's not even the largest city in the country
It's certainly beautiful for its historic architecture and I love the fact that it's very slow-paced, which is unusual for capitals, but it's not that important
And people from Bern (as well as everyone else) know this
If at all, it would be Zurich people who look down on the rest of the country but they don't. Ironically, in Switzerland it's the complete opposite from Hungary: the people who live in Zurich don't look down on other regions but other regions definitely look down on Zurich and its inhabitants
There are a ton of regional rivalries within Switzerland what one thing that everyone can rally around is hating Zurich lol
I've often heard people from other cities/regions say that Zurich folks are arrogant and unfriendly but I can't really agree with that
Although I'm not from Zurich myself, I've never made any bad experiences
I'd say that overall Swiss French people don't care about Zurich but feel that way about Geneva
Nah, they still want all the money Zurich pays to other cantons in the federal financial redistribution program ;)
Never seen so much odd dressed people as in England
it's not because they just don't care and are dressed bad cause negligence, they actively choose the weirdest style and are often the nicest and really cultivated people
In Switzerland, this is a very normal thing
For example a lot of Swiss people go weekend-shopping across the border to Germany or France because pretty much everything is much cheaper over there
A lot of people also live in Germany/France and work in Switzerland because wages are far higher here, so they cross the border twice a day
My wife and I sometimes go out for dinner to Germany
It can be fun because all the restaurants that people over there consider "fancy" or "luxurious" have prices that would be considered totally average here
So we get to feel a little bit like kings
It takes us about 20min to the Swiss-German border by car and about 1 hour to the Principality of Liechtenstein
France is a bit farther away, at 3 hours
Italy takes 3-4 hours depending on traffic
during normal circumstances, people who live close to the border go to Germany weekly for shopping, because Switzerland has stupid high prices
Swiss here near the German border
Although Switzerland is not in the EU, it's in the Schengen area
ID is enough, but it needs to be shown only very rarely when crossing the border
We go shopping over there, as the German prices are easily half the Swiss prices, except maybe electronics
Additionally, the German VAT of  usually 19%/7% is returned to the Swiss shoppers, such making even electronics cheaper
If one shops for more than 300 CHF = approx
300$, then the Swiss ask for their VAT of 7
7%/2
5%, so that's still a good rebate
Below 300 CHF per person the Swiss don't bother
Thus the cars often carry 4 passengers
Other than that, on sunny weekends, we often visit German Beer gardens at the Northern shores of Lake Constance, because unlike at the Swiss Southern shores you face the sun
Gf and family are all living in neighbouring countries, I visit them 1-2 times a month, then 3-4 times for holidays, plus I sometimes go shopping in Germany :) passport is not needed btw, just an idea withing the shengen Area (not only the EU)
When I was a kid we would go weekend trips to italy and austria every few weeks
Crossing a border is nothing more than passing a roadsign nowadays
But I still remember how it was before, kids these days don’t realizetheir luck
I’m moving to Switzerland next year for college (with egregious tuition fees of about $1700/year /s), so I’ve been going back and forth between France and Switzerland progressively moving my stuff there
To live there I need to file one 6 page paper, have some form of ID and the proof that I’m enrolled in a Swiss university and voilà! I can move to Switzerland
This is just tremendous
For swiss people it’s very common to cross the border
I live close to the german border and often go shopping there
It’s a lot cheaper
Just don’t go on weekends
Then it’s just crazy traffic and long queues for everything
Only in terms of borders though
Culture, mentality and customs still vary significantly from country to country and of course laws and languages also
While in Switzerland the Swiss drivers license is a valid ID
Can do pretty much all the same things you can do with the ID card
Except, like you said, it won't be one abroad
I think Corsica really would like France to forget they exist xD
Better bankrupt than French, am I right
I live in the south of switzerland and it took me 20 years of life to realize that "classeur" wasn't an italian word
I ain't no linguist, i just heard it being used by literally everyone for my whole life and just assumed it was italian
Or just pyjamas
Fo you use that in Germany as well
Ah ok
Yeah boxers/shirt is the same here
Serbian or Albanian id assume
Maybe Portoguese now
Stats for Switzerland: (from wikipedia)
(N) stands for national/official languages
German (N) 64%
French (N) 22
Italian (N) 8
English 5
Portuguese 3
Albanian 2
Serbo-Croatian 2
Spanish 2
Turkish 1
Romansch (N) 0
I think it’s Serbian as well
But of course this is excluding the official languages; otherwise it would be French
I looked it up
It’s portuguese
-Foreigners living in Switzerland also contribute to the country's linguistic diversity
English and Portuguese are the most commonly spoken foreign languages in Switzerland
-Spanish, Serbian, Croatian and Albanian are also common languages in Switzerland
[source]
German is the first language so it can't be second
very, you'll smell it everywhere (at least in the cities)
Not really, though I guess because we have multiple languages, depending on where you're from you'd write it according to that language
And then you have people wanting to use English versions or one of the many variations of that (Brian, Bryan, Caitlyn, Kaitlin, etc, or whatever they are)
But those aren't "from our country".
Cyril, Cyrill, Ciril, Cirill, Cyryl, Kirill, Kyrill
Sarah is also very common in German speaking countries
I see it like 50/50
Sara(h) is a very common name and both versions seem to exist about equally
At least in my experience
It's very high
The only "call out" I'd have is that the language is very Reddit-English if that makes sense
Moved to Switzerland from Spain, went back home, then moved to Australia, then back to Switzerland
It's been around 14 years since I left Spain (left at 21) and I don't plan on going back
Recently bought a flat here in Geneva, I find living standards much much higher in this part of the world, and culture wise I always felt I fit better here
I'm married to an aussie so maybe Australia will happen again in the future, I quite like it too, but there's something special about Europe
you can get lost in the wildrenes, yes
it is just hard to get to, since it's mountains
besides, you might not want to go there because of freezing hazard
We don't have a single head of state, so unless the entire Federal Council is made up of foreigners, or at least has a majority of foreigners, I don't see anyone batting an eye
Since most people can’t even name all Counsellors, I’m sure they don’t even think about their birth place
Are there other examples of political scandals started by le canard enchaîné? I know it as a satiric newspaper not as an investigation paper
In Switzerland there is a TV-show called Kassensturz where they go after shady business practics and Republik
Switzerland is like the rich kid in school
It looks like we have friends but it's all because of the money
Lichtenstein
Can we be friends
You’re definitely our closest friend as well, since we kinda don’t like everybody
I always considered Liechtenstein as our 27th canton that isn't really one but it's just like us, plus a prince
It's a proof of love
I'd go as far and say shirts with random words on it is the rule rather then the exception for young male clothing
As an adult, I wear just plain coloured t-shirts, which can be combined/layered much better anyway
Not just regular drunk, but drunk by swamp fumes
"Rire c'est bon pour la santé"
"Laughing is good for your health", said the Swiss president while looking dead inside
Don't know if this is a breakdown, but this was hilarious
On another note, I really do find commandable that our politic personnal try hard to speak every language of the Confederacy
Love them for that
Mistehr köppel, wat du yu du wenn de biimer bräiks down
Theres a video of a right wing politican during a meeting with her companys staff and her english is horrible
see for yourself:
Explain please
Seven thinking steps  I also liked ‘pingu macht problem’ although that might not be funny to others
But
why buckets
Of all things
I mean I like a good bucket as much as the next guy but this seems a little excessive
I love it
only Germany and Austria because you automatically get to know quite a lot just by having the same language
Otherwise maybe France and GB to a small extent
We do follow a lot european politics, especially subject relates to EU, France or Germany and Italy
But I live in a heavily connected region of Switzerland
For every Swiss, our communal, cantonal and federal politics keep us busy on a regular basis (it depends the level of consciousness)
For my part, my work imply that I must follow European and International politics, so yeah, I have to be locked on that
In Europe, the most depressing countries to follow in my opinion are Italy and the Visegrad group
Even Luxembourg
I can only think of the abandoned houses, hotels and bunkers deep in the alps
It would be rather creepy walking around inside of them and even worse at night
"Gegend von Schierke und Elend" is the description of the region
Yes, the place is actually called Elend (misery)
There is another village called Sorge (sorrow or worry or whatever) in the area
Most kids start to drink at the age of 14-15 here
You can drink beer and wine at age 16 here
Before ~15, most kids are probably still interested more in Pokemon than partying, so it's largely a self-solving problem
There are currently 12 (or 21 depending on how you count \* ) parties in the Swiss parliament
In general the concept of coalitions or oppositions is not known in Switzerland (I've heard the phrase 'consensus democracy' thrown around to describe this)
Since we don't have a singular president\*\* or prime minister there's never only one party or even only one side of the spectrum in charge; the highest executive power rests in the federal council which has seven members, currently from four different parties (ranging from right to left and from liberal to conservative)
In general I think the spectrum is not only quite broad but also quite detailed
Furthermore during elections we don't vote for parties, but for candidates directly (meaning you can mix and match candidates from different parties on your list)
The only thing that is maybe not quite fair is that the federal council currently does not have a member of the green or green-lib party in it
\* The bigger parties have 'youth parties' or 'young parties' and some of those also have some seats
** there exists the title of president of the federal council, but this position is almost completely ceremonial and does not hold any more power than the other members of the federal council (primus inter pares)
we have the anti-powerpoint party, but I'm not sure what others there are
>There are currently 12 (or 21 depending on how you count * ) parties in the Swiss parliament
To add to that, there are only 6 really relevant parties
The greens (left environementalists), the SP/PS (social democrats), the CVP/Middle (christian/conservative), green-liberals (greens with a market liberal ideaset), FDP/PLR (right-liberals) and the SVP/UDC (conservative/anti immigration)
The other parties are either local parties (SolidaritéS from genève [far left], lega di ticinesi from the ticino [far right]), the far left (PdA) or Christian parties (EVP [middle-left], EDU [far right, really conservative]) or parties without a destinct profil and no real reason to still exist on it's own (BDP [middle, the same as CVP])
I'd also like to add that we get to vote on specific issues on communal, cantonal and national level several times a year
These can be things like money for a new school (communal), certain laws or things in the constitution or really just whatever
Does anyone give a shit about EDU though
Do you confuse proporz-system with consesus democracy
(because you mentioned coalitions, and they don't have anything to do with proporz)
In the bigger chamber Switzerland has a proporz voting system e.g. the parties get a relativ amount of seats to the votes for them in a specific canton (it is more complicated than that, but it's ok for now)
In the bigger chamber you vote for a specific candidate (there are only one to two seats per canton) and sometimes have to chose the lesser evil
The thing that has to do with coalitions has to to with the concordance(?)/consensus-system
It is a system where you try to find an as big of an majority as possible
The opposite of that is a competitive system, where a *small* majority rules the country and not *the most possible*.
It leads to laws that are generally supported by everyone (if not, the people can intervene through popular initiatives and referendas)
The government (actually all of the parties) have to take everyone into account when making a new law, so it doesn't directly get vetoed out by the people
When making a new law, the parliament sub-chambers (which discuss a specific topic like environement or military) and then propose a new law to the national chamber
The national chamber discusses it and tries to find the biggest consensus and then, after discussion between the upper and lower chamber, the law gets enacted
During the discussion, all possible intrest groups are asked what they think (for example unions, NGOs, big firms etc
) if everyone (or most of them) can live with the solution it will be law
In the parliament the different factions (nearly the same as parties) have different aliances depending on the topic
For example there is the "Bürgerliche Allianz" from the right and middle parties the so called "Bürgerlichen" (SVP [far right/anti-immigration], FDP [liberal-rights], CVP/Middle [conservative/christian] and green-liberals), there is the "alliance of reason" (also sometimes called pro Europe alliance) from the left to the middle-right (SP [Social democrats], greens, Middle/CVP, FDP and green-liberals), and there is also the "unholy alliance" by the left and the far right (SP and SVP) the two biggest parties
It happens sometimes but then they agree for a different, mostly opposite reason
A reason for such a broad consensus sytem is imo the popular initiatives and referendas, where the people can correct a law or propose a new one
It leads the pairlament to avoid giving reason for such
One example ist the upcoming "Korrektur-Initiative" which wants to "correct" the decision by the executive who wanted to allow weapons export in some critical countries
The people didn't like it at all and started an popular initiative
Right now it is pending until we have a vote about it
They were the one who started the referenda against the discrimination law we voted on in the beginnig of 2020
Sadly they sometimes still are relevant
Usually when it's a specific issue which some left parties and some right parties (usually SVP) support or don't support for different reasons
They basically agree on yes or no, but they give totally different reasons
For example when the SP says a law is not enough to change anything so it is better to totally reject it and make a new one than continuing with the given
The SVP often says then the proposed law is way too much and thus it should be rejected
- I pay for a premium subscription for my favorite newspaper, which includes both a digital account as well as a mail-delivered paper edition (the latter of which is much more expensive), although I only ever use the digital account
- I'm still a member of the Protestant Church and therefore pay Church taxes, although I've been an atheist for my whole life (my mom originally joined and signed me up too when I was a child but she later left the Church again and I've always been too lazy to do so)
They do some decent charity work though
- I'm still an official member of a political party and pay my annual membership fees although I'm much more active in a different party with a similar platform now
Taxes
I trust the state to direct that money where it is needed
„Meinetwegen/von mir aus“ in German would come pretty close imo, but would depend on context
i think the closest would be "stimmt au wieder", which literally translated means "true too again"
C'est pas faux
In some contexts
or just "Bref"
Neither can I for the German speaking part of our country and it really bothers me
But "fair enough" is still kind of different from all of them, because I think fair enough is something more like "okay yeah, that's actually true" and I can't think of a real German translation for that
(vlt "da haste recht" oder so)
In Swiss German I‘d say „Denhalt“, but that has a passive agressive touch too
„Minetwege“ is probably pretty accurate, „vo mir us“ interestingly is ok too, bc in Switzerland that is not passive agressive, unless you deliberately make it so with your tone
Wie wäre es mit "da hast du nicht ganz unrecht"?
Swiss german is so insanely passive agressive
For example telling someone that he has made an intresting choice is often used as a harsh form of criticism
I don't think that meinetwegen is intrinsically negative, it depends on the context
See the synonyms in the [Duden] entry, some of them are negative, others neutral/positively assuring:
>einverstanden, es soll mir recht sein, gut, ich habe nichts dagegen/keine Einwände, in Ordnung, ja, nun gut/schön, ruhig, wenn es denn sein muss, wie du meinst/willst; (umgangssprachlich) in Gottes Namen, okay, von mir aus, wegen mir; (umgangssprachlich abwertend) soll er/sie doch; (veraltend) meinethalben
Yes
Didn't think of that but that fits pretty well
Hahah:D true
But I think „huh, that‘s an interesting choice you made there“ in the right tone probably has the same effect in English
Belgium can't take responsibility as a country because
well you know
I had several corrective eye surgeries when I was younger, so I assume I would be a blind beggar or something similar
Well
Napoleon and Switzerland for sure
Then of course the beginning of the oldest neutrality
Probably being a lot fitter than what I am now or dead
Would be to poor to use my smarts if I did actually live
Also it would be interesting on how things developed as my father was German, my mother Swiss
huh
100% agree
Taiwan is such an awesome and cute little country and they deserve the full support of the US and every European country
Nikolaus (Samichlaus) who comes on December 6th with his donkey and his helper Schmutzli lives in the black forest
Here a picture :)
It depends on the canton though (like everything in this country lol) I can only speak for the north-western part
Additional thing I just remembered: when the sky gets all read when tge sun sets in December/late November we say its because st nik is baking christmas cookies in the black forest
Cut off date for letters is December 14th
He just read leviticus a little *too* thuroughly
Gotta love that dog in the Fondue (there is after all "fondue chinoise" as well)
And even funnier they are mostly in the US
For a country that takes so much pride in having 3+ National languages, majority of tech and online services are exclusively Swiss German
It's pathetic really
I.e - Netflix only offering German subtitles etc
> I think large parts of the US military also still use Windows XP on their ships and subs
You'd think if any entity has the resources to pull off having an entire custom UNIX-style OS specifically tailored for them made, it'd be the US military
>For a country that takes so much pride in having 3+ National languages, majority of tech and online services are exclusively Swiss German
It's pathetic really
Yeah it's a pain in the ass when 80% of websites have German only
>Netflix only offering German subtitles etc
It what now
Never encountered this problem and I live in Geneva too
Consume mostly in English
I live in Lausanne and Netflix definitely has subtitles in french, as well as italian
What is happening I believe is that Netflix doesn’t have the same shows in every country
In Switzerland we actually benefit from the shows of the german, french and italian Netflix catalogues
If you can’t find subtitles in french for a specific show, it’s most likely because the french Netflix doesn’t have the rights to it, or that it isn’t extended to Switzerland
Except the annoying lack of Amazon
ch (that redirects you to Amazon
de) I’ve never had much issues with websites only in german in Switzerland
> majority online services are exclusively Swiss German
could you name some examples
Good
Carnotzet
A room, usually in the cellar, where you set up a table and benches / chairs, stock your wine and drink with friends
In the swiss german region of Bern there is the word „Äuä“, depending on the used context and pronunciation it can mean many things,
including but not complete : Yes, No, No way, Indeed, that’s a lie, that’s not a lie, can‘t believe it, believe it, „?“ , „!“ ..
and a lot more
Note that swiss german dialects are only spoken, not written, there are no grammatical rules
[the itis]
Yeah I know the struggle from translating Ancient Greek
It wasn't that frustrating because we translated the texts to German and not English, so we didn't have to use entire phrases as translation as we had conjunctions that somewhat fit but were still unsatisfying
But this isn't a new problem, it already was an issue when translating the New Testament from Greek to Latin nearly 2000 years ago, which is one of the reasons why this translation (and subsequently all modern translations based on this) is kinda terrible
In the Canton of Fribourg, school teach Catholicism from 6 yo to around 15 yo, so the whole obligatory school
If you are from another religion, your parents must sign some papers saying you won't follow the course
Afterwards, if you continue school (I did college), you have "religion sciences" for one year, where you talk in a more scientific and unbiased way about all the religions
Then you can choose if you want to have this course or not
yes, but it's been voluntary so far
they are planning on expanding the education on religion at the cost of geography which I find a rather bad idea, because geography is a much broader subject
If you are rude/accidentally touch or hit/ or spill beer in Germany to a man drinking beer, it's customary to challenge each other to a fistfight
After WW2, it became a custom to kneel before synagogues
May be more realistic with historical events idk
Never waste any beer, ever, or the bartender has the right to make you pay double
Since these are stereotypical, your friend might be more likely to believe it   ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
Tell him that in the Netherlands it is customary to bow to women in public
Tell him in Germany it isn't unusual for a man at a neighboring urinal to offer to shake your penis after urinating
I've never actually had an American dollar bill so this isn't too far off
I'd love to see and hold one someday when I go to 'Murica
>Tell him that in Italy, one must ask for ketchup on a pizza
We should really stick to things that don't get OPs friend killed
I must say, I was actually surprised when I first got my hands on a couple of them - didn't think there would be that much of a difference, it's just paper money after all
But many dollar bills are *very* worn
While ours are mostly pristine and very "stiff", dollar bills feel much more "clothy" in texture
Some of them have the structural integrity of a wet rag
And they smell terrible :)
*(No offense Americans, these were just the things that stood out to me)
Lol
I mean, I expected at least one case though
After all, it Germany ;D
Actually, I've heard several Americans say that they feel that Swiss people, and Germans as well, tend to stare
So there seems to be at least a subtle difference in what's considered a comfortable amount of eye contact
*Edit: Yep, apparently that really is a thing:* [*About the Swiss Stare*] *|* [*German Stare*]
Apparently we've won multiple awards for the prettiest bank notes
The more you know
Yeah but you would probably want to go for cheaper bank notes (because in some countries like 1000 equals 1 chf, so use that to your advantage) then you can make it rain for less
lifehacks
Yep I've heard of this too
Wasn't it developed during WWII because everyone was suspicious
Idk where I read that
>Plus it's such a chore to wash the money
Tell me about it
Yeah, I feel the same
Sure, most of it was probably in good fun, but sometimes these pile-ons on reddit can get a bit out of hand, where everyone just tries to outwit each other, on the expense of someone else
I have to agree
I don't dislike her or anything, but she can be a bit much
It's all so over the top
But the subject matter sometimes is still interesting, so I occasionally watch her
And it was the only source I could find for the Germans ;-)
If you want to see some of the other most beautiful bank notes
Meh, I would've laughed my ass off when I made that post
It's all just sarcasm at the end
Being a dick =!= being sarcastic
I wouldn't even have had to know to realize they're joking
That sounds
complicated
Yeah, but the color scheme is a bit all over the place while the Swiss one is all green
Maybe that why they picked the Swiss one to be most beautiful
Idk beauty is in the eye of the beholder
despite it not officially being the capital (we don't have one), Bern is probably still the best choice
very central when you look at the 4 language groups
if it were further east, the romandie would probably be a bit discontent with it
That would maximize Brno vs
Bern confusion
I had to learn in primary school that the capital city is Bern
Later moving to Bern and learning it's NOT the capital de jure, despite being headquarter of legislative and executive
Sometimes we go a bit far with federalism
For me it's the capital
If I had to move the Capital I would chose Zurich for being so central and important
But it would cause lots of problems
How about Fribourg ? A truly bilingual city
I'd put in Brüssel to trigger the UDC/SVP
I'm from Zurich countryside and I don't think it would be a good capital
I think everyone in Switzerland except zurichers would be upset about it lol
If Zurich became the capital, I hope Geneva became once again an independent Republic
Honestly - considering how decentralized our executive and judicative branch is - i think it's fair to keep the legislative branch in Berne
But if it needed to change, i guess Zurich, Basel or Geneva are the only 'modern' options, considering those are the only places with actual intl
airports
On the other hand, considering that you can be pretty much anywhere north of the alps within 1 hour from an intl
Airport it might not be relevant at all, and then it would simply be a quastion about regional politics - and i def
would not want to open that pandoras Box
Maybe Basel
Still pretty important
Switzerland is the EU’s fourth biggest trading partner behind the US, China and the UK (it used to be third before brexit)
It’s a pretty big deal for such a small country, and since we’re surrounded by EU members (except for our little Liechtenstein) we have a close relationship with its citizens
Many come to work or live in Switzerland, so the EU has been quite concerned about those aspects, hence why they agreed to sign the Bilateral Treaties
Yes
More seriously, we got lots of money and the EU needs that money
So we have agreements to exchange money
We're here to make everything that the EU does a little bit more complicated, as we are literally in the middle of the EU but won't join
Huh, I didn't know this about the Netherlands
It sounds very similar to what we have in Switzerland
The only exception is that almost all of our hospitals are publicly owned, which is something that I'm personally very glad about
I should say though that healthcare is a pretty important political topic in Switzerland too, and has been so for at least the past 20 years
Mostly because our insurance fees (premiums) are very expensive and they continue to rise
The left would like to change to a single-payer system or, at the very least, introduce more subsidies for low-income people
The right rejects all of these proposals because they believe the market should be as free as possible
So it's a very controversial topic
We had a national vote 10-15 years ago where we could've changed to a single-payer system but the popular initiative did not receive the necessary 50
01%-majority
I completely disagree
The nicest personnel over here are in the public University hospital
I don't like Doctors from private cabinets
In Spain too, the doctors and nurses are amazingly kind
Then you've never had any serious health problems
I have gone through some very, very serious health problems and I can guarantee you that a kind, friendly doctor makes a gigantic difference in a situation like
Sometimes it's worth sooo much to have a doctor sit there with you for a few minutes and tell you in a calming voice that things are going to be alright - *especially* if there's nothing anyone can do to help you at that moment
If you're the kind of guy who never cries but you're so deep in troubles (medically speaking) that you just want to ball your eyes out and give up on life, the very last thing you need is for your doctor to act like a total asshole
But Germany has a public option, doesn't it
I was not disagreeing with his own experience, obviously
I disagree from my own experience
Romanian sounds like a Slavic person mocking an Italian accent
Its still beautiful
catalan, it's not that it doesn't make sence, but for me it's spanish and french mixed, but you pronounce everything like a russian
Polish
It looks like they just take a bunch of consonants and put some accents on it
And when someones talk Polish, it's even weirder as Swiss German (that means a lot)
I wouldn't get even one word
I‘m sure here it differs as well but my experience was:
grade: school starts at 8:15 then there are two 45minute lessons until the big break (20-30minutes) then two more lessons until 11:45
in the afternoon school was from 13:30 to 15:00 three times a week
The other two times we didn‘t have school
to 6
grade: school starts at 7:30 (although i think we had one day in second grade that started at 8:15 still) the rest is the same as in first grade
Although sarting in ~4
or 5
grade some afternoons were until 16:15
In 7
to 9
grade the mornings were still from 7:30 to 11:45 with the big break after three lessons
The afternoons differed a lot because students could choose their own afternoon lessons
Many picked them so the would still have one or two afternoons off
Edit: there was also cooking school once a week in grade 8 and 9
Then students would eat at school and have the afternoon off after cleaning up and stuff
I think they get off at around 13:30
In highschool (kanti) because most students had to commute, the lessons started later
For me they started at 8:05
A lesson still was 45 minutes but we got 10 or 5 minute breaks between the lessons to switch rooms (the breaks weren’t the same in the morning and afternoon)
I usually had classes every afternoon
Some days until ~4or5 and some days only until ~3
It differed a lot from semester to semester
In one semester we had an afternoon off but two days of lessons until ~6
and only one until ~3
Oh and we ate lunch at home up until highschool
There we ate at the mensa or went to a supermarket to eat
Last school I went to wsd like that: start at 8:15, school hours were 45 minutes, no pause between them
Recess at 9:45 until 10:05
Lunch break at 11:40 and we start again at 12:40
Afternoon recess at 15:05 until 15:30
End of the day was either 16:05 or 16:50 depending of the day of the week
Cesaro is the most Swiss person
Lucerne
we often joke about how there are more tourists/east Asians in lucerne than there are Swiss people
apart from that, Lauterbrunnen and zermatt are also rather touristy
Zermatt has the Matterhorn, which is pretty much the signature Swiss mountain (the one depicted on Toblerone chocolate) and Lauterbrunnen is a yosemite-like valley that's got several amazing waterfalls and every second post about Switzerland you see is a picture of Lauterbrunnen
I’m not from Ireland, but I would have guessed cliffs of moher and the western coast in general
I know them all, I couldn't recite them on the fly but if I heard the name of one I would recognize it
Most people know half or more than half I would think
The names of the states and also most of the capitals are certainly known
However, most people probably do not know the exact location of all of them
Yeah
probably not 'most' but 'some'.
Komm, wir essen, Oma
Komm, wir essen Oma
The first one has the stress on the first syllable, the second one on the second syllable
It's only a problem in the infinitive form because they also conjugate differently
For 1st person singular that gives you "Ich fahre eine Person um" or "Ich umfahre eine Person".
I had to learn german in school for 10 years why did none of my teachers mention there are stress in german ?
Romandie
Yes
Swedish
I tried, I failed :D
Try Swiss German after German
To start probably the one from Zurich it's as far as I know the nearest to normal German
We aren't in the EU and I don't know how to feel about it
Hey, see the positives
Now you sit in the same boat as Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Norway
I bet it’s not that easy to shoot someone   you’ve never met, who hasn’t harmed you personally, especially if you make eye contact first
There is a [Swiss German (ie
Alemannic) Wikipedia] but it's relatively small (~27'700 Articles)
I only use it very very rarely (sometimes for regional stuff)
I primarily use the English Wikipedia, occasionally the German one
Isn't the Alemannic wiki just a translation of the German one
I don't think so
But except for some hyper-local topics it's probably more of a language conservation effort than an encyclopedia
Yes
Anywhere in EU/EFTA
Just say no to single use plastic
In Switzerland you can also safely drink water from city fountains unless they are clearly marked "kein Trinkwasser".
For sparkling water – a soda machine is a magical device and allows you to enjoy spiky water without wasting plastic
Here, yes absolutely (and the taste changes a bit depending on where you are because of the ground composition differences), but I have a friend studying in Paris, and when she dared to drink tap water (that tasted like chlorine apparently), everyone said she was mad for even trying it haha
In my region of Switzerland, my tap water is **literally** Evian
For me German tap water tastes like pool water, in Germany I definitely prefer bottled water
Out of curiosity, which ones
I drank tap water in many places in Poland and it was always fine
I find it reassuring that they don't ship water across the ocean
At the place I work I'm supposed to charge 2 francs per person for tapwater, but usually I don't or I just charge one head for the whole table
I do charge them full price if they are annoying or rude, or if I get the typical tourist couple that only wants tap water and shares one (1) small starter
I get it, Switzerland is expensive, but go to the damn supermarket if you're that stingy
Same in Switzerland
I was so confused initially, because in Poland, where I am from originally, blue bottle means sparkling, green means still
Anyway, still water comes from tap, sparkling comes from tap via a soda machine
Just say no to plastic
Have to admit that I was always in bigger cities (like Hamburg) when I visited Germany, that could be why it always tasted so bad
S.America -> U.S -> Switzerland
What turned out not to be true for Europe (in general)
* I'm shocked to find out how low the average salaries are outside of Switzerland
London salaries being the one that really blew my mind
* Speaking of England
I don't know where this stereotype about British food came from, but I have incredible meals whenever I go to England
For whatever reason I find pub food to be really top notch relative to "bar" food everywhere else in the world (Exceptions being S. Korea and Spain) - but those two probably has to do with there being a drinking culture that is intertwined with food
* The French, and Parisians in general, are not as rude as everyone makes it out to be
But maybe my experiences are different since I speak French
* Coming from S. America, and having been a huge football fan my whole life I must say I've been pretty surprised to find that majority of Europeans are not obsessed about football (Compared to my expectations)
Like I would say 98% of European women I meet have no interest in the sport, and put the number at around 60% for men
Thought it'd be a lot higher
Understood
But I'm comparing salaries in major European cities relative to the cost of living for said city
Let's say London salaries to (say) New York City salaries
My company has offices in both and for the same position, the salary in NYC is on average 60K USD v 35K GBP (45K USD)
From people that have lived in both cities, they claim the cost of living is quite similar
We have the same issue down here in Switzerland, the plains are warm, temperatures last week rose to 10°C. In the Alps it’s not much better, there’s snow but not nearly as much as usual
Went biking around Lake Geneva at lunchtime yesterday, it was sunny and warm, real spring vibes
Bydgoszcz was the first one although I would have known it by its German name Bromberg so the 100% first one is the one below Plovdiv
Others afterwards are Timișoara and Craiova
You need to know french, german and a little bit of italian and english
And then you need to live in switzerland for 15 years or so
Then you can maybe speak a bit, but you will clearly understand the language at this point
Don't be intimidated by the long words in German
You can understand them once you get the concept of a compound word
German has three definite definite articles (Die, Der, Das)
They all mean the English definite article "the". They also have no rule deciding where they should be placed
The syntax for German is SOV (Subject+Object+Verb) as compared to the English syntax of SVO (Subject+Verb+Object)
You can also understand half the language if you can speak English
These are tips for Standard German not Swiss German (my native language) and Alemannic (also my native language)
Those languages/dialects are demons and cans of worms I don't wanna open
French grammar and spelling conventions are similar to English
They have the same syntax of SVO (Subject+Verb+Object)
Like German, you can understand like 75% of the language if you know English
Sorry, I don't have any more tips for French, as I am learning French in school
I don't speak Italian
I will take it in College
There is none, you habe to do it the hard way
This is for swiss german
aaaand then you learn about genitiv and "Ich befinde mich in der Stadt
It's too late for me, my German is already awful
So at this point I just decided that if I don't remember the gender of a word, even if I get it wrong people will understand
Plus in Swiss German you can avoid genders almost entirely thank to the usage of "d' " to replace der/die/das
I don't know if it's just in my dialect or if I'm wrong, but when I think about it, I always use "de" for male "d' " for female and "s' " or " ds" for neutral
swiss german
oh shit that’s embarrassing lol i was thinking about whether it was akkusativ or dativ and somehow ended up with genitiv
We already have trouble figuring out what makes all of us Swiss
Hey, fuck that
Yeah, good luck with that
No offense, but to me that just sounds like another shade of "am deutschen wesen soll die welt genesen".
Yeah but fuck aristocracy too while we‘re at it
It was never important here as in „Swiss aristocracy“, we‘ve never really had that
It was always foreign folks, like the Habsburger from Austria
Fair enough
If you eat with your elbows and forearms on the table : "is your dad an aviator
If your fly is open :  "your shop is open"
If you’re being annoying and they tell you off : "go cook yourself an egg"
Same here

Here in Switzerland we have to pay around CHF 350
- for watching Tv listening to Radio or others newsmedia
You have to pay for only by owning a TV, Radio, Radio in Car or a phone, even if you don't use any of it for this
I hate this so much, I don't use any of it
"It doesn't matter, you might use it one day
Man that really makes me wonder what is going on in your forrests
If I'm right, you need a good reason to do this and you have to kill it without having it to suffer
Well Swiss German does not have an official orthography so you "write like you hear it".
The shitter (d‘Schissi)
The place where even the Pope goes alone
Not what I use in everyday life but rather jokingly
We just have such a poetic language
Beautiful
I was going to say s Hüsli (the little house) but this seems more valid
"quiet placelet"
The 'classic' answer is *'Chuchichäschtli'*, the hard 'ch' found in Swiss-German are hard to pronounce for most foreigners
I also like '*Grüazi'/'Grüezi*' especially with Germans because they struggle real hard with the diphthong 'üa'/'üe', usually they pronounce either only the 'ü' or they pronounce it 'ü-a' as two distinct vowels
Edit: I found [this] video of some dude pronouncing Chuchichäschtli, and specifically the 'CH' sound
"Trois arbre". For people who aren't used to the French R sound, it's not super easy
Gopfridstutz also leads to very entertaining results
And as a translation, Chuchichäschtli means kitchen cupboard
Grüezi is used as a greeting, usually with people you don't rrally know like a cashier, people just walking by and so on
TIL it has a tli at the end
I can say it but it's not like I see much written Swiss German here in Basel
Gopferdammi, I forgot about that one xD
"G"s yes, but I'm pretty sure our "ch"s are harder than the Dutch ones
Can't say Gopferdammi without the nundedie :D
Well, thah's my TIL for today xD
I added a youtube link to the original comment so you can listen to the Swiss pronunciation of 'ch'
We have a kind of weird thing, that causes a  ton of confusion with non-Swiss German speakers:
We call our friends Kolleg/Kollegä (colleague/s)
This is used as „friend“ or „Freund“ in German is used
The word „Fründ“/„Fründin“ (Freund/Freundin, friend) is exclusively used for romatinc relationships
It‘s used as a synonym for boyfriend/girlfriend
If you say „Er isch min Fründ“ (He‘s my friend), what you‘re really saying is „He‘s my boyfriend“. If you say „Er isch min Kolleg“, you‘re saying „He‘s my friend
This is specific for Switzerland, and causes a ton of confusion bc most Swiss people dont get that if you say „Er ist mein Kollege“ to a German you are actually calling him your colleague and not your friend
Some Swiss people also mistranslate colleague to mean friend in English bc of that
Other than „Kolleg“, we use mostly the same names the Germans do:
Junge/Jungs (boy(s)), Brudi/Bruder (brother), dude, bro
Some dialects have some fun names, bernese has the wonderful „Giele“ (Boys) (and „Meitschi“ (Girls), but I‘ve never personally heard Meitschi used for anyone older than 12 or so)
I’ve been to berlin for new years before and it’s crazy
The fireworks just do NOT stop from 8am the 31st til 8am the 2nd
You’re lucky if you get 10 seconds of silence in those two days
Germans LOVE their fireworks
(Or just really like new year’s)
That fact isn’t that fun, tbh
Nah, it's Rivella
In Switzerland the smallest coin we have is the 5ct and it’s still pretty hated
Weird thing is, some shops such as Aldi still put prices with .89 or .99, and they round up to the closest multiple of 5 (below) in the final bill
It allows them to make a few more cents
What are the boy scouts like in your country
TL;DR: What are boy scouts like in your country
I was a boy scout for about 5 years and really enjoyed my time there
I've got lots of fond memories from that time
First I was a member of the "Wölfli" ("little wolves"), which is basically the junior section of the Swiss boy scouts
I made a lot of good friends there
Around age 11, I was "promoted" to the real boy scouts
When I was 18, I went on a high school exchange year to the US
During that time, I learned how incredibly different Swiss and American boy scouts are
I would've never guessed
One of the most stunning differences was the general atmosphere
In Switzerland, being a boy scout is first and foremost meant to be fun
We did learn some handy skills (how to make a fire etc
) but most of our time was spent playing games and goofing around
Our leaders frequently came up with tasks and challenges loosely resembling a computer strategy game
For example we'd have to roam through the forest in small groups and find certain things, complete tasks, solve riddles etc
The whole thing was never meant to be uber-schoolmasterly though; sometimes a few boys would also just give up in the middle of the afternoon and go back to the central meeting place (usually an open meadow) to hang out
Our leaders would encourage us to continue but they didn't force anything on us
By comparison, boy scouts as I saw it in America was incredibly
uptight, for lack of a better word
The main intention seemed to be to lecture boys about the importance of community work
It felt much more like military service but without weapons
Everything was super strict and serious
My host brother was a boy scout and he'd do things like helping out in retirement homes or sitting in a room making packages to send them somewhere
American boy scouts didn't feel like a fun club a 12-year old would want to participate in but rather a school-like after-school activity that **parents** would want their boys to do in order to become better citizens or better christians or something like that
Here in Switzerland, we sometimes ran into boy scout groups from another municipality and we'd engage in completely pointless brawls
Our leaders thought that was hilarious (and so did we)
I don't think American boy scout leaders would ever allow that
Another shocking difference were the leaders themselves
Here in Switzerland, boy scout leaders are usually between 18-25
They can be both guys and girls
In fact, the leader-teams are usually mixed with about 2 guys and 2 girls
I loved all of my leaders; they were all awesome in their own way and they all had their unique personality
In America, most boy scout leaders seem to be middle-aged men
In fact, my host dad was a boy scout leader and he was nearly 60
I still think that's super weird
In Switzerland, leaders are something like older siblings
They're authority figures but they're also your friends
There was one leader-girl who all of us boys entrusted with our love problems because she was so sweet
As a 12-year old American kid, I would've never wanted to tell some 50-year old dude about my elementary school crush
It would have felt super uncomfortable
The fact that boy scout leaders in the US are so old made the uptight, philistine, school-like atmosphere even stronger
Another big difference was that American boy scouts seem to spend most of their time indoors, which really surprised me
Swiss boy scouts spend almost all of their time outdoors, usually in the nature
Finally, another interesting difference was that American boy scouts don't have special names
In Switzerland, every boy scout has his/her special boy scout name
In fact, there's a whole ritual that you have to go through in order to receive that name
It usually includes "surviving" a very scary scenario, such as having to walk through the forest alone at night and getting "abducted" by your leaders dressed as monsters or zombies etc
It's meant to resemble an interactive, real-life nightmare that is scary but also exciting at the same time
At the end of it, you receive your nickname by which you will thenceforth be addressed and most boys are very proud of their boy scout name
In the US, all the kids were simply addressed by their regular names and when I told my host dad about those rituals where kids have to walk through the forest at night, he just stared at me like I had lost my mind
having said all of this, what are the boy scouts like in your country
Do they resemble the ones in Switzerland or are they more like the ones in the US
Or something entirely different
Have you ever been a boy scout
And if so, did you have a nickname
What was it
Thanks for sharing :-)
Apologies for the long post
Edit: Thank you so much for all of your replies
I really enjoyed reading about all the different perspectives
One important correction: scouts in Switzerland are in fact also mixed (boys and girls together)
I must've phrased this badly
I was on a year long exchange in Tokyo (Japan), and I noticed how their scouts (i didn't join them) do a lot p it side too, despite living in a huge city and only having the numerous parks availible
similarly to Switzerland, they also do camps, which take place somewhere outside in a usually more rural area, though
Well obviously it‘s very similar to yours, but we have mixed groups
Only very few scout groups in my canton have gender split activities, but even those have a mixed summer camp
We try to get away from the military-theme, e.g. our saturday meetups are no longer called „üebig“ (lit
exercise), but „aktivität“ or „alass“ (lit
activity or event“)
Also my group is the only one in the entire canton that isn‘t attached to a church, thats also why we are one of the poorest
This is very interesting
I didn't know the Dutch scouts were banned by the nazis
Nowadays that can basically be viewed as a badge of honor ;-)
Thank you for your reply
Thanks for your reply
This is a great point that I left out to avoid making my post even longer
We also have a couple of different scouting organizations
For example the main one that I was a member of is technically protestant, while another big one is catholic
These are just labels based on tradition though
In real life, religion never plays a big role (at least it didn't in my troop)
There are also some organizations that are more adjusted for the interests of girls
Swiss boy scouts allow girls to join but you have to be a bit of a tomboy to be cool with all the rowdy, hyperactive boys
My little sister was first a member of the regular boy scouts but then it became too much for her, so she changed to an all-girls organization that focused on more calm activities that the average girl would be into
I'm very sorry you made such bad experiences
I can totally imagine it though
Not all scout troops and leaders are cool
A few years after I left (school was getting too demanding), I read in the newspaper that a scouting troop from a neighboring town had become the center of a scandal because several of the leaders turned out to be neonazis
They had been trying to indoctrinate the kids for years
I was of course pretty shocked by that
My leaders had all been such wonderful and caring people
Looking back, I must say they were also super mature for their age
I was reading your post and waited for the gender bit (because a couple days ago I just read a post on how gendered american scouts are and that that's not the case in Europe) we seemed to have grown up in different parts of Switzerland
I (a woman)  am swiss and also joined the Scouts (no one even calls the scouts boy/girl here) and it was never a question of gender (in fact I think it was incredibly ungendered) and you certainly didn't have to be a tomboy to like it, I certainly wasn't and I loved it
My guess is that we grew up in different parts in Switzerland (we also learned a lot of technical/survival things)
I think our group was very even (gender wise) and everybody loved it
But yeah, most of it has to do with goofing around, playing the part the leaders meant (they always put on some kind of storyline for the day and kinda role played it out) but it was always a lot of fun
&#x200B;
For a minute there I was thinking that you were talking about the Jungschii/Blauring thing
Oh, for sure
I didn't mean to promote traditionalist gender stereotypes
All I can say is that, in order to "survive" in our troop, you had to be a certain type of girl
I always had a lot of respect for our girl members because I'm more of a soft/calm guy myself and some of the boys in our troop were a royal pain in the ass
The reason it worked out for me was because I was the oldest kid for a very long time, so even the particularly mischievous boys respected me a bit more than everyone else (I kind of assumed the unofficial role of an assistant leader at one point)
The girls didn't have this advantage though and they really had to put up with a lot of annoying stuff at times
Looking back, our leaders probably should've been a little stricter with those boys
I think the reason they weren't is because they felt like it's healthiest for those kind of boys to act out a bit
like letting your dog run around outside for a couple of hours
To be clear, I think it's wonderful your troop was so evenly mixed
I love the idea of gender being irrelevant in the scouts
Maybe it's also a matter of age
I'm in my 30s... if you're 10 years younger than me, this may in fact have made a difference
Our society's attitude towards these issues made quite a leap from the 90s to the 2000s (at least that was my impression)
I can't say that gender was irrelevant in my troop
Like I said, we didn't have too many girls
Still though, in comparison to the US where girls weren't even allowed until recently I'd say it was very relaxed
And yes, I was in fact referring to Blauring ;-)
That's the organization my little sister joined after she left the scouts
I don't know too much about Blauring but I've heard from my sister and my mom that they're more "girls-oriented" in terms of activities and general atmosphere
This is really interesting
Makes me wonder if it's more of a "Germanic culture" (UK, central Europe, Scandinavia) type of thing
Yeah, I also find that a bit sad to be honest haha
there are a few, but they're definitely not common
My hometown is named after a former roman settlement/mansion
There aren't really ruins left but you can still kinda make out where it used to be (just farm land now though)
And many people find roman coins and stuff buried in the woods
Not common, but pretty cool
[Augusta Raurica] is just 10 kilometers from Basel, on the Rhine
There are extensive ruins there, including a (rebuilt) amphitheater that hosts concerts throughout the summer
Yea, he was a legend here too when I was a teen
That Migros Ice Tea is the best iced tea
Still some debate on whether lemon flavored is better than peach
I'd say everybody in my country EXCEPT people from Zurich will agree that Zurich sucks
LEMON all the way
But yeah, Migros Ice Tea is infamous
I think we can also agree on the fact that our swiss chocolate is far superior to any other chocolate there is
Lemon is the superior flavor and I'm ready to fight anyone on that
Peach flavor is obviously the best, it shouldn’t even be a debate
>cheese
oh boi
Tell that to my brother in-law
Most of the time one of my neighbors accepts the package and it's in front of my flat when I come home, but that's inside the building, there's no possibility of anyone stealing it
If they can't even find a neighbor to accept it, there's a little note that says you can pick it up at the post office or go online to (re)schedule delivery
Well, if we get a package, we usually either receive it while we're home or they bring it to a postal locker at our local village store, so it doesn't just stand around outside
Here, the parcel carriers put the parcels in front of the house door or in the back garden
So far none has been stolen
Yep - for the Swiss postal service
They're doing an excellent job lately, their digital services are really well done, and they strike a good balance between common sense pragmatism and still following proper procedure
For the international parcel companies like UPS or DHL it's a different story
My experiences range from decent to outright terrible
UPS is the only consistent one though - consistently bad
I try to avoid them whenever I can when ordering abroad (which is quite often)
DHL and DPD are a mixed bag it seems (depending on the driver), and FedEx I've had mostly positive experiences with
Yeah, we now have 'contactless delivery' too, but that usually means that they'll ring a doorbell and one of the neighbors (or me) will press the button to open the door into the building such that they can deposit the package inside the building
That way it's protected from the elements and only people with a key to the building (aka
Neighbors) can access it
There are expressions that are spelled exactly the same but are pronounced/emphasized differently
E.g. "öppis Umfahre" vs
"öppis umfAhre". The first means to run over something and the second means you drive around it
(Also works in German German)
I wonder why kjedelig means boring then
In Swiss Standard German (i.e. The Version of standard German that is taught in Schools here) there is no difference, but the difference is clear from context anyways
In Swiss German (which is the language we actually use everyday) the problem doesn't come up as both phrases don't really exist
I would say they do exist, however (atleast I) say im Mass for in moderation and in Massä for en masse
Ig suufe im Mass or Ig suufe in Massä.
Es trafen sich zwei Jäger im Wald
Beide tot
I thought about that, but it sound kinda contrived, in the sense that you'd only say that if you were translating the German expression
I don't think I'd ever use sucha construction when just talking
Going to visit other European countries
being in another country
Electronics
They are cheaper here than in most other european countries
Especially when you compare it to our high paychecks
I was just trying to think of something, good one
Yeah I was going to say nothing, but this is better
I haven’t been there, but according to [this site] Oslo is still cheaper than Zürich
I just googled it because i didnt know either
The article i read said it could be because theres a lot of competition between the sellers here in switzerland
Also it could be because they test how the items sells
I love them
Watching rain and hearing thunder is wonderful
No I don't. Just no
Rain outside while I'm in my bed is cozy but thunderstorms
just no
Kühlschrank (fridge) - Cooling cupboard
Scheinwerfer (spotlights) - beam thrower
Eigelb (yolk) - eggyellow
Faultier (sloth) - lazy animal
Stinktier (skunk) - stink animal
Flugzeug (plane) - fly thing
Feuerzeug (lighter) - fire thing
Spielzeug (toy) play thing
Fahrzeug (vehicle) drive thing
Edit: "Zeug" means "stuff" not "thing". While being very similar, it's not the same, sorry guys
Flugzüüg = Fly thing (plane)
Rägeschirm = Rain shield (umbrella)
Fernseher = Far-seer (TV)
Fahrzüüg = drive thing (vehicle)
Bratschufle = frying shovel (spatula)
Herdöpfel = Stove apple (potato)
those are some of the good ones I could think of atm
Also the german term for Computer is „Rechner“ which translates to calculator
I love the -thing words, way too many to list here haha
Also:
Dickhäuter (pachyderm) - Thick-skinner / Thick-hider (the word is much more common than "pachyderm" in English)
your sentence would be very similar to the german one so i‘ll make one myself
Ich rede Mundart
ich seg etz emol ned vo wo ich chume, will de huere kantönligeist regt mich uf

I'm unsure if we have bears, but if we don't have them, it would be wolves I think
I get you, It’s faster to cross Jestetten :D
wait til you see how Switzerland works
we have a council of 7 people who act as the executive, while there's also a council president who's mainly just a figurehead and doesn't have any more say
You might see a Europe flag here on the 5th for the Council or Europe day, but a flag on the 9th would be unlikely
Even on the 5th it would be at official government buildings and not something the average person would have
I recall seeing the Europe flag flying for all of May on some government buildings in the past, but I do not see that all the time and it might have been for some diplomatic thing
Sennentuntschi if you find it anywhere with subtitles
Watch ‚das weisse Rauschen‘ for Germany if you‘ve watched Goodbye Lenin
I don’t know, because our head of government has 7 heads and i‘d happily replace some of them but not the whole council
Switzerland’s is a great deal, you get 7 for 1
Same
I never really got that "we like Merkel" vibe from you guys up north
Changes yearly, has no real meaning
Technically it's the President of The Federal Council, so just the figurehead representing the aforementioned 7
Switzerland doesn't technically have a national president, even though everyone just says The Swiss President because it's simpler
And yeah, the council elects a new one every year and it grants no additional power, so
Well not elect, they more or less rotate in the order of years served in the council
Sure
I meant they agree amongst themselves, what the actual decision making process is, I admit I don't know, so I'll take your wordon this :)
I live by the contested idea that Swiss German is its own language and not a German dialect
I think Swiss German itself is oddly cute sounding
it uses loads of diminutives and also has some great, hilarious "made up" words like "schubladisieren" which literally means drawer-ise and means to put something off indefinitely
Probably that we understand the Germans but the Germans don't understand us
It‘s so diverse that even some people who also speak swiss german e.g. people from valais and people from thurgau have trouble understanding each other
We mock each others dialects all the time
I think it‘s really nice that no ther country (except the amish) speak swiss german
I couldn‘t think of going into a different country and speaking my native language
It‘s kind of weird, because technically it is german, but germans don‘t understand us, but we understand them
I think I've never seen someone compliment swiss-german, thanks
For me „schubladisieren“ means to judge people based on stereotypes
Everyone gets put in a akready existing drawer
It‘s lije box thinking
It does sound v cute
I really like the rhythm of the language, and that ‘singsong-y’ way of saying things
>we mock each others dialects all the time
AUÄÄÄ
Some people (who speak romance languages) have told me that it can also sound very rough with our "ch" sounds
guät, ich ha halt au ä zürischnurrä...
Yeah it's certainly possible but most Germans I personally know that aren't around Swiss people often have real trouble understanding a normal casual conversation
And then there's some swiss dialects like that from the Wallis or Graubünden that I myself have trouble understanding
But I would also have trouble with some German Dialects like Bayerisch for example
Sichoo nööd
For me Bavarian is more related to Austrian German actually, I think for Swiss German (in general but also especially where I live) the French influence plays an important role as well for words like "Trottoir, Portemonnaie, Velo (sometimes even Bicyclette), Parapluie
" Don't really think that there's much of a connection to Bavarian other than them both sounding weird to others though
Trying to read dutch (or flemish in your case) is always fun, it's like deciphering a text from a very drunk friend
Yoo I didn't know you say "Hoi" too, Swiss-Dutch alliance
Me neither I think, maybe it's used in some German dialects but in Swiss-German it's the most widely used form of "Hi" across the dialects
You learn new things every day
Fuck our effectiveness in war, our alliance would have the greatest chocolate, fries, cheese, beer and weed; sounds fun
Oh that would be nice but I personally don't understand you guys at all, I can read dutch reasonably well but when it's spoken it's a different story
I personally also never heard other Swiss people say that, but maybe it's those who have a more severe dialect themselves
Of course, you're probably getting accidentally invaded by us as we speak anyways
Woah okay, sounds like I need to listen to some dutch and see if I can get the hang of it
To people who don‘t like cheese: Fondue
And also in Valais (southern switzerland), they eat the balls of the bulls
(Stierhöde)
Fruit pudding is also delish  (Scotland speaking)
It's super common
I would even say that it has become a standard word in German
In my my canton, which both is French and German speaking I feel like both parts use it A LOT
I use it in both (Swiss) German and English in exactly the same way
I don't use it in French but I don't know how/if native speakers use it
I don't know if it's a me thing or if more people do it but I use it a lot with an "german" e at the end (oke)
Alternatively when I speak Spanish I change the e for an i.
C'est OK !!

There is a town of [Au] at Lake Zürich
There is a castle and some wine yards there
A very nice place to take a walk
I know of at least two places called Au: Au ZH and Au SG
There's also Bex which is about the same length in speaking because the x is silent
In the canton of Zurich, you will also find a (rather small) river called Aa

**French:** Article about [Angelina Grün,] former German handball player
Understood pretty much all sentences at the beginning, only thing I had to look up was "[réceptionneuse-attaquante] I can understand about 60–70% without problems
**Spanish:** Article about [Burka] since my mother tongue is Portuguese, I didn't have much trouble understanding the first paragraphs
Just a few words that are written completely different than in Portuguese
50 – 60%.
**Italian:** Article about [Nikolaj Ivanov] although this is a very short article, I had to look up "canottiere" and "stato" so I didn't even know what the article was all about
Had a bit of trouble with this one
About 40%.
**Romanian:** Article about [Electrometru Lippmann] again, *very* short article (2 lines of text)
I was surprised how many words I kinda could understand
But not enough words to understand the context
40–50%.
**Catalan:** Article about [Fjaðrárgljúfur,] i don't know what «congost» means, other than that it's pretty similar to Spanish
Couldn't make out the second paragraph tho
About 50%.
Speaking French and Spanish (and learning Italian), it was quite easy to understand all of them except for Romanian, which was not impossible to understand, but required quite a bit of effort

Writing a passive aggressive letter to your neighbors about whatever issue it is you're having
This is considered proper and acceptable in Switzerland
Considering the alternative is simply calling the police at 22:01 PM and letting them get a noise violation summons
Or going straight to the building management where they will be warned and have a record against them
The rest of the world is more of a "feel free to knock on my door if anything is bothering you" type system
You know face to face discussion
Hahaha yes, extra points if its an anonymous "open letter" pinned somewhere in the entrance, either calling out the people in apartment xy or describing what "someone" is doing wrong and urging "them" to stop
>Writing a passive aggressive letter to your neighbors
These are explicitly forbidden in my building
By means of a passive aggressive note from management, plastered all over the laundry room
Oh god yes
Recently there was one in my laundry room
Someone had slipped into the *horrible* habit of leaving their laundry detergent and sometimes a basket of dirty laundry they want to wash in the laundry room *when it is not their designated laundry day* . Only took two weeks for a note to appear: „As per the house rules, tenants are not allowed to store personal property in the laundry room
The laundry room is only to be used by tenants on their designated laundry days
The fun part
Our laundry room is huge
Noone could possibly be bothered by a container of laundry detergent standing around
But oh well
I’m much cooler in french :D
That's a difficult one to answer, I don't even know really
I 'feel' different when speaking different languages though
I feel like there are two general modes:
Swiss German and English
This includes my 'school high German' which is just standard German with a Swiss accent
Standard German and French
This standard German is actual standard German I speak with non-Swiss native German speakers
This is the one I use less often and I feel like I open my eyes a bit more here and just 'light up' a bit
Weird, I know
Another weird thing is that in standard German and English I am what my former Latin teacher calls a 'dialect chameleon'. To some extent, I automatically adapt my accent to the person I'm talking to (which gets uncomfortable when talking to a non-native German speaker)
This results in people sometimes being confused when I tell them where I'm from after talking to them for a bit
This leads to a second slight issue: I don't really have my own accent when speaking English which means that if I have to start talking before I have a 'reference' I have to choose an accent
If I need to sound angry when speaking English, I sometimes use an aggressive Scottish accent because it's easier to sound angry then
And sometimes I use a Scottish accent just because I feel like using it and making life difficult for everyone
I'm quadrilingual, can I still answer
I change my behaviour depending on whom I'm talking to much more than depending on the language I use to speak to them
But I guess the same is true for monolinguals, so the actual answer to your question would be no
Probably not, Italians also shout quite a lot and speak quite aggressively sometimes
As soon as you cross the border everyone is so loud
The Italian speakers in Switzerland aren't though for some reason
From what I've heard, guide dogs are usually trained in Italian for those reasons
And because they don't want guide dogs to be limited to one area
We're indifferent about Bern
In Switzerland it's not the capital city that gets the hate because in theory we don't have a capital, Bern is usually just considered to be the capital
The hated place is the largest city, Zürich
They say we're arrogant but they're probably just jealous
I actually quite like it
Geneva as well for us french speakers
De jure we don't, but the facto it's Bern
But it is the capital de facto, everything else is just splitting hairs
it wasn't s controversy, it just is geographically, strategically, historically, politically and aesthetically the most sensible choice
They're not as nice as the rest of the French-speaking part of Switzerland
Same goes for the Lausanners
I guess you could say that in Switzerland‘s case, Zurich and Geneva kinda fulfil the role of capitals and that‘s why they are disliked
Bern is too insignificant to be hated
> Declaring Zürich as capital (de jure) would be interesting
Sure, if you like thermonuclear war
Jura Bernois or Neuchâtel, provided you speak French
I see you've been to eastern Switzerland, possibly Zürich
People there are not representative of the rest of us
We're a tiny country but mentalities and people's characters differ significantly if you go West only by 100km or so
Lol aargau, the nuclear wasteland DMZ between our glorious capital and the filthy cokehead banksters centre of Zürich
Many of us are total cunts
Avoid the east, it's worse there
It'll be harder to make friends, and make daily life harder in general
Don't count on everyone speaking English
Some won't even though they could
You might feel excluded somewhat
Imagine you come here, live here for a few months, have a job, blah blah blah, then one friday evening your coworkers invite you to a beer
Great, you think, they accept me
But when you get there, they'll speak French 99% of the time, and getting progressively more annoyed having to speak English with you as they get more drunk
It's nothing personal, but still you'll feel a bit excluded
Situations like that will happen again and again and will take their toll on your emotional well-being if not your mind
So, long story short
If you plan on living somewhere, doesn't matter where, learn the language
Italian: Bellinzona, Locarno/Ascona, Lugano
German: Fribourg, Berne
But honestly the French speaking Swiss are just nicer in general
Of course not, we're not barbarians
Our executive branch isnt even able to collapse, therefore basically never
Our executive branch consists of 7 people (Bundesräte)
We have the so called "Zauberformel" which basically makes sure that all the major parties have government responsibilities
The three biggest parties get 2 seats and the 4th biggest party gets 1, totalling 7
Therefore the opposition in Switzerland has historically been really small
If one of the 7 people fucks up bad, they tend to get replaced by another person of the same party
The only time that hasnt really happend was 2007 but that story would take too long to explain
Swiss politics is based on consensus - it's always about finding a solution that works for everyone so there are never ever any coalitions or oppositions that could fall apart
As far as I understand in a coalition principle the danger for the executive branch is that a coalition might fall apart and they'd loose the majority in parliament and thus the ability to do pretty much anything
That simply cannot happen in a consensus democracy
Edit: I remembered a story which illustrates Swiss politics like no other (Newsstories in German: [1] and [2] :
There was a political meeting, and everyone knew that they'd vote on some legislation that day
One of the politicians present (Christian Levrat - then president of the SP, Social Party, Left Socialists) mentioned that on that day his daughter was graduating from school, but unfortunately he couldn't be there for the occasion because the vote was so important
Another politician from a different party (Konrad Garber, CVP, Christians People Party, Conservatives) was appalled and told Levrat that that's unacceptable and that family should always cowe first
He was so appalled by the idea of someone misning their daughters graduation, that he offered to vote as Levrat would - even if this means voting against his own political views
The deal wan made and Garber promised to follow the vote of Roberto Zanetti (SP, as such a close friend of Levrat) in questions to faithfully replace Levrat
The problem was not quite solved yet though, as Levrat had lost his Car keys and would not make it in time
Federal Councilor Ueli Maurer (SVP, Swiss Peoples Party, right-wing conservatives, the polar opposite of Levrats' SP) stepped in and offered his car to Levrat for the day
According to all involved all promises were kept
(The car keys were later found and Maurer took Levrats car so they could meet up and swap cars back
It was first used in 1959 as an ironic description of the proposed 2-2-2-1 system by Switzerlands most important publication NZZ (Neue Zürcher Zeitung)
When the 2-2-2-1 was first introduced, the FDP (market liberals) would loose a seat as a result
The NZZ and the FDP are so closly connected that they are basically a party publication when it comes to politics
Therefore the NZZ attacked the supporters of the 2-2-2-1 system and ironically called it a magic formula since only in theory and with magic the 2-2-2-1 would be a good idea
Over the years it lost its negative connotation and basically became the official name of the 2-2-2-1 system
Because it magically holds our politics together
Edit: typo
For two reasons: First the greens had a massive boost  in the last election - it's new that they are that big
And secondly, and more importantly, because it's not about who has how many seats in parliament - it's about consensus
It's about forming a government that everyone can agree on
See the discussion between me and u/[stijinp] in this thread
Also: if the green manage to repeat their success in 2023 I fully expect that the distribution of seats will change - but probably not to give the greens a seat, but to give the green-libs (GLP) a seat - even if they are smaller than the greens - again: consensus not proportion is what matters
If you look at our last election (2019) of the first chamber (parliament) you can see that the greens just surpassed the christian demorcats for the first time in their history
The 2-2-2-1 formula isnt written into law which therefore doesnt give the green party an an obligatory seat
The parliament elects the seven Bundesräte, its not a direct election
If the green party confirms their result in 2023, their claim to a seat become a lot more substantial since the 2019 result can no longer be considered a fluke
Its more likely tough that the FDP or the SP need to give up one seat, which would make it a 2-2-1-1-1 formula
Also what is not mentioned is that the christian democrats are actually the biggest party in our senate(Ständerat) with i think 12 seats while the greens have 3 or 4 so, which means cvp(christian democrats) will not give up a seat soon
If the greens will get a seat it would logically come from the fdp since they have 2 and proportionally "should" only get 1
There are more fundamental differences between a Westminster-style coalition/opposition political system and the Swiss political system
In Switzerland, the 7 cabinet ministers are expected to publicly defend a single common position, even if it contradicts their own personal party's opinions
Furthermore, it's very common for the 4 parties represented in the government to vote against the work done by the government, and this isn't perceived as a threat to a governing coalition
Essentially, there is a clear line of demarcation between the legislative and executive roles in Switzerland, it's less about party tribalism
Ironically, the two parties that statistically support the proposals of the government the most are the GLP and the BDP - two smaller parties that don't have a seat on it
A vote of no confidence is also something that doesn't exist in Switzerland
The difference is that in Switzerland it's not 3-4 parties - it's every single party, even the smallest, most fringe party
There's never "Parties A, B and C are in charge now" it's always "Parliament, who as a whole is in charge, looks like this: Party A 24%, Party B 20% ...".
Even excluding a fringe party with one or two seats wouldn't work, because their supporters would just organize popular initiatives or referenda
This even happens with organizations that aren't parties, there's a huge sea of NGOs, NPOs, interest groups etc
that are included in the process of finding a consensus because literally anyone (even private citizens) can override anything parliament or the federal council does by initiative or referendum
Unless the GLP makes a huge jump next election, I personally really wouldn't expect them to gain a seat without a complete rework of the Zauberformel
If the Greens are the significantly bigger party, they'll get the "green seat" - the Greens (and the SP) electorate would otherwise riot if they get treated like that
However, I saw some journalists suggest that we might eventually end up with a new 2-1-1-1-1-1 Zauberformel: 2 for the SVP, and 1 for everybody else - FDP, CVP, SP, GLP and Greens
Well it'd be a very Swiss compromise
There's certainly good cause for a greener Federal Council, but the greens and the SP being as close as they are having two SP seats and a green seat wouldn't work
Prioritizing the GLP would represent green ideas without destroying the left-right balance
But I see that 2-6X1 would also solve the issue
>t's impossible to always have consensus on every topic
Not only is it possible, it's necessary
In Swiss politics absolutely nothing happens if there's no consensus on some sort of compromise on the matter
No one ever get's their way
And that's the secret sauce of a consensus democracy: compromise - you have to find a compromise that (nearly) everyone agrees with
There's really three things that can happen to any proposed legislation:
\- if you don't find a decent compromise your proposal will fail in parliament, (and that's the end of that - you could launch a popular initiative, but if your idea has failed in parliament the chances of it passing the public vote are very slim)
\-  if you do find a compromise that satisfies parliament but does not satisfy the general public it will likely fail in a popular referendum,
The **only way** to change anything is to make it such a good compromise that neither parliament nor the general public disagree
Pretty much so, yes
Even if we may suck at it, most of us had to learn at least two foreign languages in school, usually english and german/french/italian, sometimes spanish
But it’s a common enough skill that I think most people aren’t impressed if you’re bilingual
Define "foreign". I learned a total of 4 languages in basic school
Only one is considered foreign
That's the only one I can properly speak besides my mother tongue
I consider knowing 2 languages nothing special
I mean I can, and have, read books in French
My French is Okish at best, definitely enough to get by but nowhere near as fluent as my English is
If somebody is completely bilingual (like completely native in German and French) that's still impressive to me
Just a whole other level I'll probably won't ever be able to reach
I would say that I know a decent amount of English, but every damn time I have to ... you know ... actually speak it - I always feel like I've lost all memory
"Excuse me, do you know where I can find this restaurant
"Yes ju hev to go ova der den left"
Why am i like this
Unless you know the person extremely well (good friend/regular visitor) or were specifically asked to get something out of the fridge, yes it's seen as rude
And it's also weird
Basically, don't do it unless you were asked to do so
Yes it is very rude in Switzerland unless you are giving permission
**France:**
I like the culture of having to greet each other before making a request/transaction/what have you
It humanizes interactions
i.e: (At a department store)
**Bonjour** can I help you
Which leads me to
**Germany:**
Whereas in Germany, people don't feel the need to greet you prior to interactions (in my French example they tend to go straight to "Can I help you
What I appreciate about Germans (specially in the service sector) is that they take their time to explain/help you out if you request it
Which conversely I think it's one of the biggest weaknesses of the French
Germans feel it's their job to be thorough and I appreciate that as a customer or someone that needs help
I ended up buying a Zwilling nail cutter at an airport store in Frankfurt only because the lady spent an inordinate amounts of time explaining me the difference between all of them
It cost me 12 EUR
Meanwhile (in France) I was once trying to decide between 3 different bottles of champagne
All around 50+ EUR and the French dude basically said "I don't know what you like
so you decide"
**Italy:**
Apero culture is the best
Order an Aperol Spritz
Get small pizzas with anchovies
Not a fan of anchovies but I'll always say yes to free food
And it's DELICIOUS
I really like the mindset of the EU and the idea of a united European peninsula
however, I also like the idea of Swiss neutrality and independence :p
**Germany** Those guys know how to party, very polite people who love to help
**France** Beautiful art and the language sounds unbelievably pretty, learning it atm
**Italy** Breathtaking scenery, super yummy food and I love that you're so passionate about it
**Austria** Sadly only been to Bregenz, wanna visit Vienna and Salzburg too, beautiful country
**Liechtenstein** It's like a cute mini-me-version of Switzerland and I love that it's only 20 mins away from me :)
How laid back they are compared to us
Here everyone is really strict
If you‘re more then 5 minutes late to a meeting they will call you and ask if everything is ok and if you have trouble finding the place
Oh and also Pizza
The prices
Love living close to the German border <3
After going on a summer trip with a camper van in Germany, I became envious of two things:
They have (and much like a majority of nothern countries) bicycle roads ONLY FOR BICYCLES
Because let me tell you, here a lot of people hate bicycles, and in some cities, if you try to ride a bike, you'll have a 1/4 chance of getting in some accident
They have not only clean campings, but also places especially made for camper vans, which I simply couldn't find in counties like France or Switzerland
Meanwhile (in France) I was once trying to decide between 3 different bottles of champagne
All around 50+ EUR and the French dude basically said "I don't know what you like
so you decide"
Could happen anywhere if the staff can’t be bothered/are hungover
Not sure which part of CH you’re from but this happens to me regularly in German-speaking CH
I was in a bakery once where there was a choice between two kinds of mandelgipfeli (sugar or glazing) I was really just trying to practice my Swiss German by having banter with the assistant, but it failed miserably
This has never happened in France e.g. Paris, Montpellier, from my experience
Then you might like norway even more
They are even crazier about winter sports
Also, they have way more nature than we do
The architecture is really different tho
This wasn't Carrefour, it was an independent spirits/wine store
The assumption is (to me and maybe it's incorrect) that if you open/run a store of that sort you should more or less have some say in these type of questions
To the contrary
I'm in the opinion that it's much easier to describe why I like (say) one type of beer over another and give recommendations accordingly
Like clear differences in taste, feel between wheat/white beers, lagers, pale ales, lambics, dubbels, etc
But something like the iOS v. Android debate seems to be even more subjective to one's personal tastes/preferences
First i thought Christoph Blocher, but then i thought, nah he's gonna die soon
An now i think Roger Köppel
He's a far right politician and writer at the german "newspaper" *Weltwoche*
I guess we probably know who you are talking about
I‘m sorry
We don't want him either, so don't get any ideas
[link for the lazy]
My favorite part:
>> He proposed setting up large fans on the borders to blow airborne radioactive waste into the Baltic states
It's as accurate as Democratic People's Republic of North Korea
Switzerland is quite strict
No names that would hurt the child's wellbeing
This includes names that can be offensive for other cultures or names that when combined with the surname end up sounding ridicolous (my mother knew a woman called "rosa capezzoli" which translates to "pink nipples")
No names that do not align with the baby's gender
No names of negative figures from religious texts
No brand names (you can't call your baby "adidas")
No names that double as a toponym unless they already exist in the parents' language ("Asia" is fine, "nottingham" isn't)
No made up names
No names that are typically surnames
George Foreman in shambles
Friend of mine is Brazilian of Italian origin and has the same name as his father but Junior
Italian authorities refused it, so he had to legally change his name to include "Junior".
Uhm I think it's usually Jonathan with just one h but yeah
Ah right, that exists too, though interestingly enough unrelated to the other one
Maybe that's where the G comes from in your example, the Italian for John would be Giovanni from what I know so it's actually correct here
But there are probably spellings like Jo(h)vanni out there too nowadays lol
Ah right, that exists too, though interestingly enough unrelated to the other one
Maybe that's where the G comes from in your example, the Italian for John would be Giovanni from what I know so it's actually correct here
But there are probably spellings like Jo(h)vanni out there too nowadays lol
Ah that makes sense
I've started learning Italian a bit and this makes remembering the spelling of words a lot easier
The only thing you have I believe is the ho, hai, ha thing
The Technorama in Winterthur
It teaches science in a playful way
For me, the national transport museum in Lucerne
The national railway museum of the UK is great, but the Swiss museum is even better as it also includes other modes of transport
Surprisingly the exhibition that I loved the most, besides trains, were the cable cars
That really depends, but for me:
Art: [Fondation Beyeler] in Basel (also the most visited artmuseum in Switzerland)
Technology/science: [Swiss Science Center Technorama] in Winterthur
Historical: [Freilichtmuseum Ballenberg] near Brienz (open-air museum, seasonal)
Natural History: (haven't been to any in quite a while
Military History: [Flieger Flab Museum] in Dübendorf (literaly: Plane Antiaircraft Museum)
Zoo: Zooh
in Zürich
&#x200B;
And some odd-Balls that are definitely worth the trip:
Criminal/criminal history: [Kriminalmuseum der Kantonspolizei Zürich] in the headquarters of the cantonal police of Zürich (only guided tours - parts of it are not for the faint of heart )
Former military fortress and now
military and crystal exhibitions:  [Sasso San Gottardo] on the Gotthard mountain pass
&#x200B;
**Note:** Some of them have reduced opening hours or are only open for guided tours at the moment, for obvious reasons
&#x200B;
edit: Links and further information
we've got the Landesmuseum in Zurich, which is great for the history of Switzerland itself and the country's story
there's also the Verkehrshaus in Luzern which is great to go to with children and its all about transportation and technologies like that
then there's the Technorama in Winterthur, which is another one that is incredibly great for kids and its got a ton of cool science exhibits, most of which are interactive and fun to play with and as a child I always had time fly by way too fast in the Technorama
[Das Tram-Musemu Zürich]
Pretty fun and entertaining
Fun fact: the tickets to the museum look like old tram tickets, and you actually need to validate them at the entrance
I tend to appreciate it when people try, though it can be annoying if their skills are so bad that I either can’t understand them at all or it’s prolonging our interaction inconveniently
It’s also annoying if they refuse help
Also, please be aware of how appropriate the setting is language practice
With friends or in casual settings, my tolerance is a lot higher for language learners, compared to if I’m in a business setting or at work, or in a rush somewhere
I lived in Germany for a few years, during the time that my German was A2 to B2
When I tried to speak to any German person in German, they were always absurdly patient with me, and if I didn’t understand, they basically dropped everything until I did
Like, honestly, I have never met a people more motivated to help a non-native speaker find the Aldi before, or explain how the bus stop had moved, or get my kids registered for school
And all this in a country where even my garbageman spoke great English
Amazing
That attitude was one of my top 5 favorite things about living there
either chocolate, cheese or the smell of pine forests
That smell of cheese fondue that lingers in your home for hours and hours after eating one
Yes
Because it would terminate the business model of a huge mafia overnight, and police forces could get back to fighting actual crime
I thought the Kingdom of Syldavia was a real country in the Balkans because of the comic 'The Adventure of Tintin'
Also as a french speaker watching french TV as a kid, seeing all these incredible adds about products and fast foods that didn’t exist in Switzerland made France look like a magical place
You'll get plenty recommendations for major cities
Here is my take with second-tier cities:
* Bern, CH
* Aache, DE
* Stockholm, SE
* Gdańsk, PL
* Grodno, BY (once the situation settles down there, right now it isn't safe)
With apologies to Swedes for calling Stockholm "second tier". It certainly isn't Paris or London
But it's my favorite city in Europe
Right
I think Bern might be longitudinally too close to Aachen to
Dated albanian swiss and serbian swiss women
Wouldnt do it again, dealing with their racists families wasnt worth it in the end
Dated a French girl 5 years ago
It was long distance but we saw eachother every 3 months
It was good while it lasted but she didn't have feelings anymore after 2 and a half years so we ended the relationship there
Never spoken to her since because I don't like speaking to exes, it's always awkward and more often than not I still have feelings for a while after a breakup
The distance made it easier to accept things and I had no chance to bump into her at the supermarket, unlike my more recent ex
We have them too but we're less focused on them and they are different
For example, the baby boomers don't start immediately after the war, but go from 1954 to 1964 or something and before that it's the 'post war kids' or something
In Europe, we couldn't do the boom immediately because there was cleanup to be done after the war
And then it goes like X, Y, Z. Don't know the exact years though
That‘s fucked up
we usually write "ä" in Swiss German to say what would be "eine" in high German
U (which means "and", but we also sometimes say und)
Ä ( which means "a". Like in: a house)
Standard German doesn't, but some Swiss German dialects have quite a few (although there is no official Swiss German orthography, it's only written in informal contexts)
Most of these do not occur in all dialects:
* *a* - syonymous to Standard "an [den]" (~to [the])
Pronounced long (sometimes written aa/ah), it corresponds to Standard "an" (a detachable verb prefix)
* *ä*/*e* - masculine and/or neutral indefinite article
* *i* - syonymous to Standard "in [den]" (~into [the])
Pronounced long, it corresponds to Standard "ein" (a detachable verb prefix) and/or the pronoun "ich" (I/me)
* *o* (long) - equivalent to "auch" (also/too)
* *u* - equivalent to "und" (and)
Pronounced long, it is used as an intensifier (like very/hella) in a few dialects
Some are just consonants, although I guess it's debatable whether those are true words or just clitics:
* *d* - feminine definite article
* *s* - neutral definite article
* *z* - roughly equivalent to Standard "in" (~in/at) for geographical statements, and "zu" (~to) in some other contexts
I’d say there’s also 'ô' as in 'ô mon roi'
Rinderkennzeichungs- und Rindfleischettikierubgsaufgabenübertragungsüberwachungsgesetz
Yeah in Swiss German too: "i" for I, "o" for "also", "ä" for "a/an", "u" for "and", "d" for "the (feminine)", "z" for "at".
How come
I'm not Mexican but this was such a huge meme :o (idk maybe it was just in Peru
But I feel like I saw it quite a lot
Fair enough xD
Swiss people are infamous for being extremely private about their income
We even have a saying that goes: "You don't talk about money, you simply have it
So yes, while there are exceptions such as myself (I'm totally fine talking about my income), Swiss people over all consider it very rude to ask others how much money they have or what they make
I know people who don't even talk about this stuff with their close family members
Money is easily the biggest taboo topic in Switzerland
Swiss here
We don't talk about money
Like, at all
I think this is mostly true for the older generations, most people I know who are  my age (I’m 24) have absolutely no issues with talking about money
But, the topic rarely comes up
Even though I have no reservations in talking about it, it‘s just not such a common topic in Switzerland
It‘s certainly very taboo in many older generations
I would also say Swiss people are infamous for being extremely private, period
I don‘t know if money is THE biggest taboo topic, since there are so many big taboos, I’d venture to say that especially in the older generations there are other topics which are just as taboo as money
I personally don‘t really enjoy this taboo culture, I like to talk about anything and everything:)
I think black olives are more popular here, but I don't like both kinds
While there are many, surely soon to be pointed out by other redditors, I think it is interesting to also consider the one big failure:
A program written in ADA caused an exception, resulting from the conversion of data from a 64-bit floating point format to a 16-bit signed integer, leading to an “Operand Error”.
That, boys and girls, [is how one turns 775 tonnes of rocket including 4 satellites into confetti]
No, not everyone is fluent in all the other languages; though most people know enough to survive if for some reason they get stranded in another part of the country
For example my French isn't great and my Italian is extremely basic but they're sufficient to ask for help, order food and get a hotel room
Generally speaking, the bilinguality of people also depends on how closely they grow up and live to the language border
For example if you're from St
Gall, your French will probably be less fluent than if you're from Bern
If you're from Biel/Bienne, you may be fully bilingual
Likewise, people from Lausanne will probably be better at German than those who grow up in Geneva
And the same rule is true for German/Italian and French/Italian (and there's also Romansch)
Being able to speak the other national languages used to be considered extremely important in Switzerland in the old days
For example my grandmother and many others in her generation went on an au-pair year to another part of the country
In those days, becoming fluent at another national language was viewed as a type of patriotic duty
After all, Switzerland is a nation of will and the way we keep and strengthen our community is by practising a culture of exchange and togetherness
Unfortunately in my opinion, this attitude has become significantly weaker in Switzerland over the past few decades
These days, English is increasingly being used as a lingua franca even within our country and people are losing the ability to speak with their countrymen and -women in French, German or Italian
The language of instruction in Swiss schools depends from Canton to Canton
In Ticino, it's Italian
In the Cantons of Geneva, Vaud, Fribourg, Neuchâtel and Jura, it is French
In the Canton of Wallis/Valais, it depends on the region
In all the other Cantons, the language of instruction is standard German
It's important to note that standard German is not the same as what "German"-speaking Swiss people actually use in their everyday life
In fact, children who grow up in Basel, Zurich or Bern have to learn standard German in elementary school
It doesn't come to us naturally
The starting point and duration of foreign language teaching in Swiss schools also depends from Canton to Canton
For example my French lessons began at age 11 (grade 5)
In some places this happens later
In recent years, the linguistic battle between English and the foreign national languages has also become a hot iron in Swiss politics
When I grew up in the 1990s, it was still widely accepted that children should first learn German/French and later move on to English
These days, many Cantons have shifted to a model where children first learn English and then move on to German/French
As a tendency, it is the German speakers in Switzerland who are most welcoming of this cultural and political shift
This is not surprising since we are the most powerful/linguistically privileged group in this country
It is easy for us to ignore French; more so than for our French speaking countrypeople to ignore German
If push comes to shove, Romand and Ticinesi culture are more threatened to go extinct or be overtaken than German-Swiss culture
This can also be seen when you look at Swiss national politics
Most Romand and Ticinesi politicians are fluent at German, while many German-native politicians struggle to deliver a speech in Italian or French
In the Swiss national parliament, everyone gets to use his/her native language thanks to an arsenal of interpreters
However, this doesn't change the fact that German is subtly viewed as a must-know by most of those politicians
Some Romands are rather frustrated by this condition and I can understand them well
It is not a fair situation but unfortunately one that is almost impossible to change due to the demographic power dynamics
This being said, I also believe that Switzerland is doing a pretty good job overall to keep its different cultural parts connected
Contrary to Belgium, we have never had any serious animosities between the different regions; at least not in recent decades
Despite the hurdles and problems I have mentioned above, I think Swiss people are still very much cherishing the cultural and linguistic diversity of their country
I, for one, certainly feel emotionally closer to a person from Lausanne or Geneva than a person from Paris
Rationally, this doesn't make any sense and you could say it's a little stupid but I think it also shows a certain feeling of national unity that transcends linguistic borders and in my opinion this is something positive
Lots of my young friends here in german speaking switzerland laugh about themselves not being able to speak french
Sadly most of them can only speak english, some can even speak better spanish than french, even if we started spanish classes at age 14 and french at 11
I think of it as some sort of a patriotic duty to learn at least french
I also know lots of people who speak better italian than french (also started learning with 15)
I don't like this trend that les romandes are expected to speak german while the swiss-german always speak german with anyone
Often english is used between the different linguistic groups, also in the military, at least among the recruits
I talked lots about the german-romandes relation because it is way worse with italian
I always feel shit when i go to ticino and have to speak german or english because i don't speak italian
However, i don't have that feeling when i cross the border to como in italy
I also have to say that it is only obligatory to learn one other language in school
So we only have to learn french and then we can chose to learn italian, but we can also chose spanish or another subject
I think in all the other linguistic regions they have to learn german
The first comment summed everything up pretty good
I'm currently practising my french (A2/B1) in order to be able to speak with my fellow people
If you want to see some demonstrations I highly recommend the Swiss press conferences about the COVID pandemic
Posted it on another comment here:
Thank you for writing this, otherwise I would have felt the obligation of doing so and probably wouldn't have done such a good job
Two additions: 1
in the Romansh speaking areas (parts of Graubünden) Romansh actually is the language of instruction in school but they start to learn German as a forgein language at an early age and pretty much everyone is bilingual
They also come into contact with German a lot so this is natural and in gymnasium most students choose German as their language of instruction
In Ticino, Lombardian dialects (Ticines) are spoken, but unlike Romansh they aren't an official language
They are intelligible to other Lombardian dialects but other speakers of Italian can't understand them
In Bregaglia, a valley in southern Graubünden, another Lombardian dialect is spoken
There is also the local Bargaiot, based on Lombardian, combines Italian, Rumansh and even some German
In most parts of the Romandie the spoken language used to be Franco-Provençal
Now it is only spoken in the municipality of Évolène, but also not as an official language
This is a personal statement
I find it sad that people use English as a lingua franca
We have four recognised languages as well as some others, we don't need to import a new one
Replacing this multilingualism with English would be a loss
Not knowing another national language also shows that you don't care what the others do over there
The concept is 'chacun à sa langue' not 'ok we're using another language that isn't even native to this country'.
To add to the whole politics german/french situation: I highly recommend watching some press conferences of the whole covid pandemic
They're a great example for being able to have mixed conversations, many occurrences of reporters asking in French and getting a German answer and vice versa
And even the people giving the speech switch around and mostly have the full details in their own language but abbreviate them again in another one in French/German and sometimes Italian
And they all take care to be easily understandable
I wouldn't consider myself fluent in French even though I learned it for more than 8 years in School but those press conferences are no problem for me to understand
They're on YouTube, search for Point de presse (by BAG or the Swiss Federal Council)
>found signs and supermarket labels often written only in French and German
When a third language was available, it was English
Well to be fair legally signs and labels only have to be written in the local language
Now if the company wants to write more it can and yeah usually it will pick the most used: German and English
Products with labels in more languages are usually imported
>The fact that many couldn't understand one of their national languages annoyed me greatly at the beginning
You cannot expect us to be fluent in 5 languages
That's a highly unrealistic expectation
So the mindset among my school collegues is that the french classes are boring and that it's hard to learn
I think some of them prefer other langagues because they are able to chose them themselves at a much more mature age
My willingness to learn french only came when i grew older
I also think that they still need to learn what it means to live in a multilingual country
As far as i know, there haven't been any tension in our country concerning languages
They just prefer english because you use that almost on a daily basis with the internet
There's the thing we call Röstigraben
(Seemingly the German part eats Rösti, French part doesn't really)
This stands for the social and cultural differences we have between those regions, you can see it in votes and elections, the French part often has a different opinion than the German part
And in the Military, if you're stationed in one part, the few people that speak the other language usually hang out together and those are the ones that fuck up the most
Obviously cause nobody takes the time to explain everything twice so as long as no one asks questions it's assumed everybody understood, what leads to misunderstandings and so on
Just in the nature of things and the environment
It's not really a tense situation
We love each other very much, especially for those differences
But we like to poke fun at each other
I've heard that it's considered inappropriate to speak dialects in Italy so that doesn't really surprise me
You are basically replacing your dialects with the variation from Rome which is basically what France did with Parisian French a few hundred years ago (I think it was then)
As a french speaker, I feel like the situation is a bit similar here
I mean we’re notorious for being bad at German I think, and since it’s not even the language you use there’s a certain disdain about having to learn it in school
It’s also a difficult language
However German in school was a compulsory subject (at least for me, I did 7 years of German as compulsory classes, and 3 as optional ones in High School, but it will vary between cantons) as opposed to Italian which has always only been an option
Italian is closer to French obviously, so I think many people like to learn it better than German
Yes, that is a normal thing here that happens for Kindergarten
Children are taught independence very early, and that includes making it to school
Kids wear a special yellow sash/vest with a reflector light and it has their name and address and school on it in case they encounter trouble
It is not unusual to see children about age 5 or 6 on a public transport tram alone or in small groups on their way to school
I live in the third largest city in Switzerland, which is small compared to most other countries, but the metro area is a little more than half a million people
Yes, it's normal
Kids are encouraged to walk alone as soon as they start Kindergarten (age 4)
In the first days and weeks, a parent will usually accompany them, but later, walking alone is considered an essential part of the Kindergarten/school experience
That being said, many kids walk in groups of children and most of the time, the Kindergarten isn't too far away
Usually like 5-15mins (there are exceptions, but at least in my town, we had a school bus for kids who had to walk long distances)
I'm not sure I would consider Swiss drivers as particularly safe, but I think walking alone to school is just part of our culture
It also gave me a lot of confidence when I was 4/5
Lessons on road safety and how to behave around cars are part of the Swiss curriculum and they are usually taught by the police
I remember my Kindergarten class practising crossing streets with a local police officer
The police didn't come every week, but they returned regularly throughout the years
In Kindergarten, they even gifted us an audiobook about road safety for kids, which I listened to frequently when I was younger
One common mistake is "make a picture" instead of "take a picture", because in (Swiss) German, we make them (ein Foto machen)
I often mess up convenient and comfortable
I know which one is which but somehow have to stop myself quite often mid sentence to correct myself
Both translate to "bequem" in German so maybe that's the reason behind my mistake
My Turkish boss recently had to say the word “sewing” out loud for what I assume was the first time and pronounced it “suing”. Totally legitimate guess, but wrong word altogether
I know someone who doesn’t like to remember verbs in past tense so he uses the do auxiliary for everything
So instead of, “I called you yesterday,” it’s “I did call you yesterday
” Instead of “I ate at that restaurant last week,” it “I did eat at that restaurant last week
” Instead of “I already submitted the proposal,” “I did already submit the proposal
It makes him sound so emphatic
I find it very charming
In Swiss German, we "do" a lot, e.g. "Ich tue dä Abfall use" (I'm taking out the garbage)
Also common in questions, e.g. "Tuesch hüt no wäsche
" (Are you doing laundry today
There's other ways to say or ask these things, but that's one of them
That's also true for German (ein Foto schießen), but not for Swiss German
That doesn't really work in Swiss German, but you can "make someone legs" (jemandem Beine machen) if you want them to hurry up ;-)
Mine was in my Erasmus semester in Sweden when I wanted to get my login for the university account
I approached the counter and was explained in Swedish that I needed to take a ticket
Ok, did that, waited and went back to the counter
I started in English (my Swedish wasn't good enough for such situations) until I had to show my ID card
The woman behind the counter asked from what region I was from (it's Zurich) and for the rest I was served in Wallis German
Later I met a guy at a party also from Wallis
I wouldn't have recognised if no-one had told me, not surprising because his mother tongue was French
The latter is probably the normal case for Swiss people abroad: German speakers don't recognise francophone or Italian Swiss but more likely the other way
I was in Amsterdam with a good friend and we were eating dinner in this very nice Italian restaurant
The food was excellent, and there was this very charismatic waiter
When he brought us our drinks he heard us talking a bit in Swiss german, then asked "Sind ihr au Schwizer
" (_'Are you guys Swiss as well
'_)
We were very surprised as Swiss people are much harder to find in foreign countries than German people
So we had a good laugh and talked for a bit
He told us that he grew up in Basel and later moved to Amsterdam when he was still young
He brought us some free Limoncello afterwards
Very nice experience
Switzerland issues one with your passport IIRC
Everything is in 5 languages
They are issued to everyone, regardless of age
Since I don't have a Swiss ID, here's what a [Portuguese] one looks like from the front
And apparently I'm unable to find a good resolution [picture] of both sides
>Switzerland issues one with your passport IIRC
Only if you ask for one when issuing the passport
You can choose to get the ID, the passport or both (price will be different of course)
The passport and the ID can be issued separately
I had an ID card basically since I was born, but only got my passport made when I was 17
I have had both since I was born
You don't have to have an ID/passport when travelling inside the Schengen-Area
From Switzerland at least you must have one of those things
I (31, swiss) dodged it in school
It was not taught in elementary school back then when I was a kid, and it was not mandatory yet in highschool
I chose English as an elective subject for half a year but didn't continue after that because it was sooooooooooo boring
I think I couldn't stand it because I was already way above the skill level they tried to teach us
And that was mostly due to online multiplayer games and MMORPG's (mostly GuildWars as I wasn't into WoW because I was poor af and the monthly subscription didn't appeal to me)
My English skills were quite limited when I started playing these games at first, but after a while they basically 'forced' me to communicate with other people in English - in writing and later also in voice chats
Also I joined a few international forums (yeah, it was quite a while ago
Are forums still a thing
) and got harshly corrected for my inferior grammar there - there are quite a few mistakes I learned to avoid that way :D (your, you are, you're)
When I joined university, I was still feeling insecure about my English skills and was intimidated by the amount of English literature I suddenly had to read
Oh boy, in my first year there I was reading that stuff with google translate open, basically
I learned a lot of new words quickly and during that time I also decided that I really have to improve my English so I started switching language to English whenever possible
I watched movies in English with English subtitles - and played games whenever possible in English as well
Vocabulary greatly increased with Minecraft and strategy/city building games, really
I felt comfortable to write my first scientific essay in English when I was almost finished with my bachelor's degree
I felt insecure about it first but the tutor - a native English speaker - told me that it was well written and that raised my confidence
In the last few years I started working in academia as well and suddenly I had to communicate in English every day because the research group was very international
I also had to write in English every day - mails, applications, scientific papers
I also made a few new friends from all over the world in the process
These days I almost text more in English than in German on a daily basis, and i read, watch and listen to more English content than German too
I can't watch German dubbed movies or tv-shows anymore, and most game translations make me cringe so hard I can't stand it anymore
so TLDR: games, more games, and academia forcing me to use English on a daily basis
In 2nd grade (schools in Zurich work like that) and I improved it my frequent visits to England with my family
Mainly from TV channels like Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, Boomerang, and Disney
And then Discovery and Nat Geo as I got older
As for the improvement bit, English is so pervasive in day-to-day life that it isn't that hard to come across native speakers
Yes it's weird, isn't it
The only reason i could dodge it was because my class was basically the last one with the old system in the last year the old system was in place
The old system would have required me to pick English in the next Semester in high school for the last 2 years of high school
The new system however was already in place for the students below my class, and for them English was already mandatory
With the new system, they were not required to take English in the final 2 years of high school because they already had it
The year i would have been required to pick English, they switched systems entirely
Therefore i was no longer required to take it, nor did i have the mandatory courses the newer students had
Only option for me was the electives course and that one sucked so i quit it after half a year :P
but a thousand of pictures of things with names attached
I know many words for different types of wood now :P
I had a friend who spent her Erasmus year in (southern) Germany
Now, while Germany by itself isn't a weird place or destination, I thought it was a bit strange for a university student from the northern part of Switzerland to go on an exchange year to southern Germany
I mean
this is the one year where you have the opportunity to go literally *anywhere you want*. I spent a year studying in South Korea
I know a guy who spent a year in China
You could go to Uruguay or Namibia
And even if you prefer to stay in Europe
you could go to Iceland
Or Portugal
Or Russia
But southern Germany
I mean, her exchange university was located near enough that she could come home by train and spend her weekends at home
I guess it worked for her, so that's good but I find that a bit strange
Honestly, no
I know a lot of people feel this way but in my opinion, you're only 20-something once and
yolo
Before I went on my exchange year, I had already wasted time on learning Latin, which my home university forced me to do for my majors
Down the line, nobody really cares if you graduate at age 25 or 28
It's like your final grades in your high school diploma
you may think they're important in the moment but 20 years later, nobody will care about them (not even you)
On the other hand, there are moments in life when you are presented with a unique opportunity to make a special experience and I believe you should grab those opportunities
They may never return
I'm not saying you necessarily have to go outside of Europe but I do believe the experience should be priority number one
You'll have your whole life to work on your career
Statistically, you'll be spending more time at work during the next 40 years than with your friends, romantic partner or children
There are just two relatively short periods in life where you are somewhat free: your late teens and 20s before life becomes super serious and your early retirement before you get too old and sick to be very active
In my opinion, these periods should be used to the fullest
But see, that second part is exactly what I personally find weird
To me, a big part of an exchange year is growing up and maturing
Having to deal with things on your own or finding people who help you if you encounter problems
If you can just take a train for 2 hours and go ask your parents for help, that kind of defeats the purpose of an exchange year
Or at least ONE of the purposes
Erasmus isn't the only study-abroad program
And like I said, you don't *have* to go outside of Europe
Just
y'know, maybe go a bit further than 200km across the border
I'm convinced I can recognize french women
It's mostly their style that gives them away I think and a minor part are facial features
But that's it
Sometimes italian or german but that's more hit or miss
- "Hopp de Bäse" literally "Go that Broom (??)" means hurry up
- "Läck Bobbi" literally "Lick Bobby" said when shocked, astonisched at something
- "Dr schnäller isch dr Gschwinder" lit
"the faste ome is the swifter one", first come first serve
-  "chasch nid s Föifi und s Weggli ha" lit
"you can't have the 5fr coin and the bread roll", means you can't have everything
- "Blos mer doch id Schueh", lit
"blow into my shoes", fuck off
- "Rütsch mer dr Buckel ab", lit
"Slide down my hunchback", fuck off
- "Mach kei Büro uff", lit
"Don't open up an office", don't make things complicated
- "Mit allnä Wasser gwäsche", lit
"Washed with all waters", someone being sneaky/treacherous
Can confirm, I know all of those as well (except for the sausage ham one)
Oh we have that one too
But instead of a stallion it's an elephant
No, it doesn't at all actually
We say: "Du sollst aus einer Mücke nicht gleich einen Elefanten machen
Yeah we know about the Académie here, and some of us might comply with it, but it has even less influence than it has in France so it’s not very relevant
Is it somehow related to the Alliance Française
I always asumed it was the Cambridge English Language Assesment, but now that I think about it that doesn't really make sense at it is for non native speakers while the RAE does way more than just give language certificates
That's the most RAE thing I read today
Not really with French, but definitely the case with German
One time someone thought I was french after hearing me speak
I told him I was Swiss but of course he took it as that I was from Sweden
I found it funny so I didn’t correct him, and now I like to think that there’s at least one guy out there who thinks they speak french in Sweden
Every freakin time
You're a French speaker
You must be from France
The only time it helps me was when I am on holidays and someone's asking me where I am from
I often say France, as Switzerland is always assimilated to rich people
It stops them from trying to sell me some expensive scam ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
But one downside of being a French speaking country which isn't France is when it comes to French youtubers
They're doing a tour
Only in France
They're selling merch
Only in metropolitan France
Kinda the same goes for some singers
This happens to me and my family all the time
What about Italian and Romansh
Well, we ve have a [beach]  too
W-Nuss vo Bümpliz by Patent Ochsner
The scottish people from the karaoke bar on Lanzarote seemed to enjoy it
and you have Manele music
Great song in a room full of drunk people
Suddenly everyone sings along
Have always thought you guys sound Scottish
I think that’s why I enjoy Swiss German more than Hoch Deutsch
For the longest time I only knew Deichkind from "Leider Geil" it was only recently that someone showed me some other songs by them (1000 Jahre Bier is great)
There's a different dialect every 2 kilometres or so
When i was in secondary school, my teacher showed us a website that could track down our position by asking us questions about the words we are using
The site managed to locate the exact town i grew up in, thus leading me to think there are indeed variations of dialect from village to village
Major ones ? No, clearly not, but they are many differences
Also, this was in the French speaking part of Switzerland, who isn't nearly as known for having dialect compared to the German/Romanche speaking part
This also applies to Switzerland Idk about the Romanic Part, but in Swiss German Allemanic Dialects vary very fast from one village to the other
Dialects are basically dead in Romandie
Only older people, in more isolated villages, still speak their local "patois".
This is exactly how it is in Switzerland, except that we have no King
Not an expert, but I'd say it's mostly due to Romandie having a lot fewer isolated areas
Everywhere is "near a city" so the common French has spread a lot easier
Cuckoo clocks are Swabian
I can only think of something that is the other way around
Everyone always acts like Switzerland was neutral and didn't do anything and that we're the nice ones
While we didn't go to war, that's about it
This country definetly isn't innocent
(Polish part of my soul speaking)
Sex ed
Seems to exist everywhere else
Some Gymnasiums in Switzerland still teach Classical Latin and Ancient Greek as a mandatory subject
I don't know how common that is in other countries
A diploma in Latin is also required at many Swiss universities to study certain fields in the humanities such as History
At my Gymnasium, we had gymnastics as a mandatory class in addition to regular PE
It was basically a dance class
We also had to attend musical instruments class as a mandatory addition to regular music class
Upon entering Gymnasium, every student had to pick a musical instrument of their choice - for example I picked the guitar
Contrary to regular music class which we attended with everyone else, musical instrument class was usually a teacher with 1-3 students per lesson (I was always alone with my teacher)
There were exams just like in every other class and the grade of our final exam had the same weight as that in math or French
It's also mandatory here in Switzerland, also grades 7-9
We have it in Switzerland and I was probably the only guy to like it haha
Here it's not mandatory but depending on the regional rules about high schools it's possible to switch from mandatory english classes to ancient greek and from mandatory french to italian
The second one actually makes sense considering both are official national languages here but the greek one is used by noone, just a strange relict of the past
I actually had most of this during primary school, so grades 4 to 6 (only little emphasis on cooking, though, mostly crafting, sewing etc
Also, the situation is more nuanced in grades 7-9 and depends on whether you go to a middle school or to a high-school (gymnasium) directly after primary school
Afaik, it's not mandatory in high-schools
At least not when I went to school in Zürich
In Aargau we had sewing (2-6), crafting (1-6) and cooking/cleaning/nutrition (7)
We have the small village of [St-Gingolph] that’s literally split in half between Switzerland and France (Wiki in french for the pictures, but it exists in english)
There’s even a [custom house] in the middle of the village
I’ve been there once, and it’s pretty striking how different the atmosphere in the two halves of the village is, you can really tell they don’t belong to the same country
Basel is considered a swiss city but the suburbs stretch into germany and france
There is 3 train stations: a swiss, a german and a french one
i think Rheinfelden is also a good example
You mean the one in Zürich
The one in Bern doesn't skip that part (if I remember well, haven't been there like in a year)
Edit: I just remembered the one in Bern is the historical museum, so I guess you mean the one in Zürich
How do Austrians view the Anschluss today
Depending on who I talk with they either see themselves as victims or collaborators of nazi germany
**German**: 100%
Native
**English**: 100%
**Norwegian/Danish/Swedish**: 25%.
Sorry man, the sentences just look too different even if individual words look recognisable
**Dutch/Afrikaans**: 90%
Absolutely no problem
The only hiccups are a few words
**Low German**: 95%
It's very familiar because even if people don't often speak Low German anymore, the stereotypical High German accent from the region still often makes use of its features like e.g. exchanging "s" for "t" and turning "t"s into "d"s.
**Luxembourgish**: 95%
See above, but with some different rules
**Icelandic**: 10%
Can only guess the gist because of recognisable place names
***BONUS:***
**Alemannic**: 99%
Not my dialect
Just wanted to say that there's also an Allemanic Wiki :)
I have two t shirts signed by nba players
I stopped wearing them because I got annoyed by all the people asking me who’s signing this is
They are now my pajama shirts
EU4: Tried Switzerland a few times, but never finished a run
I love HRE runs - I finished Austria -> HRE 2 times (both pre-1
30) and Brandenburg -> Prussia -> HRE once (post-1
30)
Apart from that, I mostly choose nations from all over the place, often randomly - one of my first finished runs was as the Indian kingdom of Orissa (pre-Dharma), and another one was as the East-African minor nation of Dongola
CK2: I loved playing vikings, but I realize they were pretty much easy mode
I also started a few games where I would randomly switch countries every time my ruler died or every 100 years, with the goal of exporting the save to EU4 and doinf the same thing there
I only continued a game in EU4 once, though - mostly I would lose interest beforehand, in part because bordergore would get worse and worse
CK3: I'm doing a viking run atm
Sadly, I think they're even more "easy mode" than in CK2
Stellaris: I mostly play materialistic, egalitarian empires
I sometimes feel like I'm the only Stellaris player not commiting war crimes
Berlin
I was planning to go there with a friend at the end of May, but we had to cancel it
I really want to visit it, I just love the vibe of the city, the art scene with the museums, theaters and the nightlife as well
You got scammed like hell
Well, my kids are in primary school in Switzerland right now, and they definitely know where Switzerland is on a map
It’s possible that the reason the kids in your example didn’t know who the president was is that there isn’t really a “president” like in the US—there’s a 7-person federal council with a rotating leader
The only reason I know who the current president is is that he grew up in a village near where I live now
And it’s possible, depending on the age of the kids, that they hadn’t learned European geography yet
In 6P (9-10), the kids learn about reading maps by studying the map of their own canton (state)
Switzerland is very federalist—in general, local is much more important than central
So they learn about their canton before they learn about their country
Saw two campers with chinese license plates a few years ago
Clear like rock water xDD Never heard that one translated to English
Had to read it twice to understand why it sounded funny
Crystal clear would be the English version, but I now prefer l'eau de roche literally translated :)
Generalizations but
Swiss Germans root for Germany
Swiss French for France
Swiss Italians for Italy
* Italy
* Whomever is playing against France o)
Yes, France or Switzerland because I'm from both
If there is a match between them I will root for Switzerland
If there is none of them, I will go case by case
I loved the Iceland soccer team during the Euro in 2016
I don't know what I'm doing
I'm just doing some random things, but I usually support the neighbours, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, Japan and Greece and then some random others, depending on who is available in the first place
Swiss Germans do not root for Germany
Also generalizing, of course
As a Swiss French believe me no one roots for France except the French themselves
Especially not during the last world cup
I usually root for Germany, but that’s because my grandfather was German
Not the case in Geneva
Lots of support for France during the WC and Euros
How open italians are, I met some in france we didn't know eachother and they were full on cuddling etc
I kinda miss this now in Switzerland
Not OP either but I also see it with Brits abroad
Group of families I know befriended an "upper class" British family (whatever that means but they identified themselves as such)
And though they were courteous they generally wanted no part of any of us
Meaning we'd invite them over, get an excuse
One day one of families in the group brings up the fact that her parents are extremely well off
Which none of us were aware of, considering they live very modest lives
Like she remarked that her father takes private jets to go on ski holidays
Suddenly that British family wanted to be best friends with them and have their kids have play dates all the time
Not for the rest of us
I was in Bristol and got so tired of the small talk (specially Taxi drivers) that I started pretending I don't speak English
I dream of *accidentally* bombarding oe invading Lichtenstein, just like my forefathers before me
I think Switzerland should conquer Liechtenstein
... Yes, I'm joking
but only half-joking
They basically speak a Swiss dialect and they already use our currency so
On a completely serious note, though, I think the political system of Liechtenstein is absolutely ridiculous
Basically, they have direct democracy just like we do but with the key difference that the Prince gets to veto everything he wants
This led to the following, amazingly absurd situation: a couple of years ago, a group of citizens in Liechtenstein wanted to abolish the Prince's veto right
They wrote a popular initiative for a constitutional change and began to collect signatures
The idea was hugely popular, came to a vote and was approved by a large majority of the country's population
And guess what happened next
Yup, Mr
I-like-to-smell-my-own-farts-Prince-of-Liechtenstein vetoed the outcome of the vote
I mean, you've got to let that marinade in your brain
*he vetoed his population's decision to abolish his veto-right*. It would be funny if it weren't so sad
But hey, it's totally cool because last year, the population of Liechtenstein got to celebrate the 500-year anniversary of their monarchy
*Thank you so, so much dear Prince for ignoring our wishes and ruling over us in your pretentious castle while we common peasants get to line up at the street, clap in admiration and kiss your ass as you drive by in your luxury car*.
I don't know
I think it's time to spread some freedom and democracy in that country
I just learned recently that they have their own tiny Olympic-like games called [Games of the small States of Europe] and I just find it cute
Also apparently next year Vatican City is going to join, which blows my mind because I didn’t even know they had anything like athletes there
I hope we’ll get to see the Pope run the 100m, but I think there’s little chances
personally, I love liechtenstein
it's fun having this fellow central European, neutral, rich nation as a neighbour and they share a lot of things with us
other microstates, I like too
they make things interesting to me and they're a remnant of when things used to be different and I like that
They can't drive for shit tho
Somehow I can't find anything about this, only about the time when people actually voted for him to keep his veto right, and about the time he threatened to move to Austria if he didn't get more power in the country
Do you have a source
From what I've seen, they're pretty regular folks
The International Criminal Court (ICC) will decide whats wrong or right .... ohh wait
I'm staying neutral
And it will certainly not bring more stability and peace to this region of the world
> Big countries are above the law
Has nothing to do with the size
the US isn't part of the International Criminal Court (ICC) ...
Ze Germans
Just kidding
Nobody is going to invade us
They're all too scared
Besides, what kind of idiot would attack his own bank
Even Adolf had figured that one out
Liechtenstein
Tbf, he did have plans but didn't commit to them because it wouldn't be worth it
So our strategy technically worked
Liechtenstein has it's own Banks
The EU could invade and occupy your Parlament
Actually do Brexit and leave again
Imho the fastest way this will ever be solved
In Switzerland everyone knows this song:
There's some songs from "L'Abbé Bovet" which are beautiful, and some others are very funny
It's typical choir songs in my canton, but I'd say the catchiest I've ever sung (and I'm always happy to sing it again and again) is [Méli-mélo] from him
Edit: oh and some people will kill me for that, but if we change genres, I'm always up for singing [that] :)
Yes, I was going to say the same
I think the reason they went for this is because Hagrid dropped out of school early, so the implication is that he's not exactly a sophisticated person
I think he's supposed to sound a bit like some kind and caring but eccentric dude who's been living in his tent in a forest for the past 20 years
In Geneva we use *mascogne* which doesn't really have any meaning other than that to my knowledge
No etymology or origin either afaik
In regular French it's *antisèche* from the verb *sécher* which can mean go blank/dry up
We too call it „Spickzettel“ or sometimes just „Spick“
„Spick“ is also a childrens magazine here in Switzerland
bigino also in Ticino, Switzerland
That concept is too niche/new to have a word outside English I would say
We have had lockerd in the Gymnasium I've went to, I used mine for all my books and stuff but there were also people who didn't use theirs at all
Basically when you get to the school you get the key to your locker and you keep that until you leave, so I had mine for 8 years (grades 6-13)
We had lockers but you had to pay for them
Like at the start of the first year of high school you could decide if you wanted a locker for x amount of money per year (it was pretty cheap)
I think they just didn‘t have enough lockers for everyone
After a while they changed the system in my school, built new lockers and from then on i think everyone just got assigned to one
Not sure about the second lockers but on the first ones you had to install your own lock
Also the placement of the lockers wasn‘t that great
There where three rows of lockers on top of each other, it was kind of a narrow corridor and some people had to walk by
Often times it was very crowded there
And having multiple buildings for different classes you often still had to carry a few kgs of books and folders in your backpack
Otherwise you‘d have to run from one building to the one with the lockers and maybe to another building to get to your next class in ten minutes
And hope you get fast enough access to your locker in the crowded space
Had to do that a few times when I forgot something in there
Wasn‘t fun
Also many people came to school by public transport and many just came on time
I for example had to carry the books for the next morning with me otherwise I would be late for the class
But that‘s different for every school i guess
In middle and high school, yes
In primary, they often have space beneath their desks for books and stuff
Not really, but we do often have little "chapels" gilled with bones
Our entire country is basically one big bunker
We have huge bunkers in the mountains and every citizen needs to have a place in an underground bunker either in their house or buildings like schools and hospitals
In addition to bunkers for civilians there are the bunkers in the mountains for military use (even though more and more of those are getting closed or turned into museums and stuff)
Being located between some of the biggest warmongers in central european history made our military really paranoid
In case of war our main strategy is literally hide in the mountains/bunkers, blow up brigdes and tunnels (this can actually be done remotely at any time for many important tunnels and bridges) and just keep enemies out

If you're interested some pictures and wikipedia article
[oh we really don’t stand out at all
Not standing out
The economy and we dont get involved in any disputes
Just chill in the middle
Trains, hella expensive places for tourists and beer that costs 6-7$ a pint in the town center
Well we have 4 official langauages, although one is almost extinguished
Its about 62% German 23% French 10% Italian and 5% Romansh
I remember in London people were always saying cheers mate !
I've got a boner for historic borders that are aesthetically pleasing
like the polish Lithuanian commonwealth at its height, or napoleonic France
the qing empire is also a nice one
some of the persian empires too
I could go on for days
I kinda like our shape, it's so cute and put together with two little arms
Italy, because it has all natural borders, either it‘s mountains or the sea
I will absolutely steal Swineland and use it from now on in map discussions
I find Switzerland kinda looks like a pig
I think it looks more like a fish
I love that, except for the North Germany part
how mental is it that they just randomly owned dalmatia
as an alternative, I like the look of the "Frances natural borders" idea, aesthetically speaking
The UK always looked like a bunny to me
stay neutral and try to start dialogue between the two parties
Well, your neighbour Spain apparently sent troops to help Turkey
Can you maybe shout over the border for them to stop
we can't really do anything else
Or it's easier to hide genocide outside of your borders as "war"...
Not saying it is the reason, but it is way easier to justify dead civilians in a war than in your own country
[Comment with a linked tweet]
To me, it leaves a bad taste in my mouth to even help them while they're committing such actions
Personally, I'd withdraw the support
But I see that they're there for (4
) years now, so that may be hard to do
Time to start a referendum in Switzerland, just give me about a year or two
I didn't fact check if any other country is similar to this, but because our country has 4 official languages (French, German, Italian, Rumantsch), in order not to prioritise any of those, our official country name is in Latin (confoederatio helvetica), which is why our country code is CH
We have four official languages, that‘a kind of unique
And then there‘s our infamous neutrality (this is an age old policy that states that Switzerland will not involve themselves in any armed conflict between other countries, it is still in place today) which is why we were very close to both world wars (Geographically, we’re between Germany and Italy, or Austria and France
Schaffhausen was even accidentally bombed by the allies during ww2) but were not directly involved in either
We have four official languages:  German, French, Italian and Rumantsch
Our political system is also pretty cool
Legislation is done on three different levels: federal, cantonal (our cantons are the equivalent of the American States, though they're not quite as large) and communal
Each level has its own legislative, executive and judiciary organ, and each level is responsible for different things
The federal parliament (let's not get into the others, shall we) has two chambers, very similar to those of the United States
The federal executive body is the Federal Council, which composes seven members that are elected yearly by the parliament
This forces members of very diverse political parties and opinions to find compromises, and the same thing is valid for members of Parliament, too, because there is no dominating party there; for a new law to be passed, it has to have the approval of several different political parties
And pretty much any major new piece of legislation is subject to a popular referendum, in which a majority of the population has to approve of the piece
In addition, the people can force parliament to pass a new piece of legislation through a popular initiative, which again has to be approved of through a referendum
All in all, the Swiss political system (at  least on the federal level) forces compromise between the major parties (we call the fact that the different parties rule together "Konkordanz")
Because a new piece of legislation requires the direct approval of several major parties and of the population, it usually takes years for a compromise to be found and approved of
The result is usually a solution no one likes but everyone can live with
The system works very well (though it is a little slow), but it only works because Switzerland is such a small country
If the interests involved were much larger and diverse, it would probably not work as well
i thought this was like the babyklappe which is
a different thing
I think the biggest thing that sets us apart is our form of democracy
Having 7 head of states, initiatives, petitions and beeing extremely federalist is really unique
I cant really find anything similar in Europe
Just as a sideinfo for all foreigners
We dont have a direct democracy
Its a semi-direct democracy since we still elect two chambers
Yeah, even as a native German speaker I will never ever not find noting numbers down difficult because of this
In spoken speech it is completely natural, but transcribing numbers does require more mental effort that Anglophones simply don't have
Your hand is moving against what your ears tells you you just heard, and it takes a few moments for the brain finally to intervene as the arbiter
If I am dictating my phone number, I always say all digits individually
I too thought the exact same thing
This right here
The right to start initiatives and petitions and practically propose laws or changes to law (on a constitutional level
) is not only unique but also leads to some funny situations in law
Our constitution (Schweizer Bundesverfassung) is a mix between human rights, what authority the "Bund" has, but also random things that got changed or added by the people who voted
Truee, I didn‘t even think of that:)
Long words are "unique" in the german language, but not Germany (Austria and Switzerland got that too)
And yes it is a real word
It means to deal or overcome ones history or past
(Vergangenheit = past, bewältigen = to overcome or cope with sth)
I honestly don't know any other languages that do this, but it doesn't seem to unlikely to me
After all it's not that crazy to put words together to make a new word
&#x200B;
If anyone knows another languge that does this I would really like to know about it
Ah yes that actually makes sense
It's the same for our swiss-germand dialect which sounds similiar to dutch at times
I kinda forgot about Dutch to be honest but I guess it shares a lot with german too
We don't have much of a music scene so the "popular" songs are going to be played to death for years to come
Most current one is probably still "079" by Lo & Leduc which came out in early 2018
Oh absolutely I love Faber, would have gone to his show in 2 months
But don't know how much he is actually played on the radio
Nice
I would say he's pretty popular, especially with the slightly ~alternative people (uni students) in all German speaking countries but again, not one to get blasted in stores haha
So I think he might be the most popular swiss musician right now, but "079" is just more universally known (and by now, hated
Ah yes sorry, I meant in Switzerland itself, don't think it was ever much of a thing elsewhere
Honestly same, so I wouldn't take my word on anything I said haha
Thurgau or Tessin
Romands and Thurgau
Yeah, but overall I'd say that Graubünden would be the "odd" canton
Well, that or Appenzell (both of them) :D
It’s from Germany but I need to share [this] It’s a beauty youtuber who tried to become a musician
I believe it’s in the top 10 most disliked YouTube videos
For Switzerland, [this] is a bad one
Especially if you consider that someone thought it would have a chance at the Eurovision Song Contest
0 points for that
Actually a fun song but it's been played to death by every radio station for the last two years now
My first boyfriend's parents even bought him a bigger bed, because he only had a small single bed
They had zero problems with me staying over
I even got my own key after a few months
And they were active church-goers and attended a bible study group etc
I've never quite understood what the problem is with my, or my partners, parents knowing what's going on
Why would that be an issue
The culture around Sex is just quite different here, much less 'prude' than in the US
Yup
My parents didn't care
When I brought a boyfriend home, it was clear he'd stay in my room, and it was obvious what might happen
There wasn't even any question about it
Americans have a really wierd relationship with sex
That's why I put prude in quotes, on the one hand they are an extremely sexualised society, on the otherhand they view Sex as something dirty and taboo
Maybe the word 'chlidish' is the better choice than 'prude' to describe the American mindset when it comes to sex
Or somewhere in between childish and prude I guess
At least that's consistent then
What utterly baffles me about the Americans is that they are so highly sexualised but still treat sex and nudity as a taboo
Having a Taboo and respecting that taboo makes sense, it's a mature thing to do
So is openly talking about things that aren't taboo
But pretending that something is taboo only to constantly break said taboo and giggle about it like a bunch teenagers is, well, immature (which is ok when you're a teenager but just seems silly when you're an adult)
I know it's not an agency, it's apolitical party; but in Switzerland, we have the "anti powerpoint party" as a real political party
We have a president
Sounds weird to list that here but there's a reason
The head of state is not one person but it's the Federal council, consisting of 7 members that have equal power
The president is just one of those, usually for one year and then they switch it up again
So the president is first among equals
The reason we have one is simply for representative causes, kinda hard to meet other presidents/leaders of other countries if they have to accommodate 7 of us
I don't think it is
Yes but it's not an important symbolism like the queen is for England
Pretty much only exists for convenience
9/10 people couldn't name our current president even if they had no trouble listing all 7 members of the council
Historically those paper formats where a DIN standard first
It was issued as DIN 476 in 1922 and adopted in 1975 as International Standard ISO 216
as far as I know, it's serious
It’s quite slow and kinda boring, but in a sense I find it very Swiss so I like it like that
The lyrics are also all like 'the sun is shining on the mountains and it’s a nice day'. Not epic or grandiose, but again very Swiss
To be honest, nobody knows it
You have it in like, four different languages, and people usually know two sentences and then just mumble the rest
I'd like to change it, but it's difficult seeing as it should include all regions
I think they tried to, but Switzerland being Switzerland, that didn't work
Stupid fun fact: people who want to be naturalized Swiss have to learn and know the whole thing
Swiss here, our national anthem's called Swiss Psalm and like the name indicates, its text is too religious in regards to how demographics have changed, at least in the German version
Most Swiss students learn at least their language region's version of it
I was fortunate enough to have grown up in a bilingual town and we learnt both the German and the French text
I definitely prefer the French text as it's more concerned with the beauty of the country and its mountains rather than to respect and fear God like the German text
There were attempts in the past to change the text in all four languages to a more neutral version, that is more representative of today's Switzerland, resulting in a now a still inofficial text that can be sung as an alternative
Yeah it’s not too bad but it would be nice if it was in swissgerman
I would say about 6 or 7 different kinds
I never really counted them though
never counted em, but at least 10 in a normal grocery store
probably around 5 in my local village shop
Also I think it depends on the time of the year
There’s usually at least some Golden, Gala and Pink Lady here at my local Coop, but the rest varies quite a bit
Boskop is also quite common
mmmmmm pink lady my favorite of them all
100% agree they're so good
A fondue or/and raclette set
I was specifically looking for this comment
Here in Switzerland too
When I visited Sweden last summer I brought back a swedish can of aromat as a souvenir
We call them Walkie Talkie here as well but i think Tratschi Watschi would be a way better name
We use a shit ton of diminutives which makes our entire language seem kind of childish
We generally use the diminutive -li a lot (Apfel = apple, Öpfeli = small apple), it makes things sound cute because you'd often talk to children with diminutives
one of the most common names for a swiss restaurant is Rössli, "Ross" = "horse" so "Rössli" basically means "horsey" which is a weird name for a Restaurant
Lol, my mom (Swiss) calls it "Füt-Füt". I've always felt a bit emberassed
There were these weird things called handy talkies
The Germans started using the word Handy for their mobile phones
The original handy talkies are now known as walkie talkies
Yes, we really do that a lot
I think it's interesting that sometimes it even sounds wrong if you don't use the diminutive
I would say "Chlämmerli" for clothespin, but never "Chlammere". Or "Wägeli" for shopping cart
In German, this is the sound of a rooster
Excellent
Makes sense
Why isn't it called "Verhü(e)terli"? It would make our language even more ridiculous
The Austrian diminutive -(e)rl isn't used that often, right
A year ago, I found out we don't speak the same language
We were in a small shop in Vienna and my mom didn't understand the word "Sackerl" (which is a cute Austrian word) and I had to translate it for her
Natel for me is like the old ones (not smartphones) and a word that I associate with our allemanic dialects rather than standard German
The word makes a bit more sense because you use the device for NAchrichten and TELefonieren
Prepare to be invaded, heretic
It's "Säckli". The word "Tüte" is forgein to us, just like many other German words
We use it neither for ice cream ("cornet", a French loanword) nor for marihuana (joint)
Right lol
Those ones that you had in your car if you were one of the very cool people
Not a native speaker, but I use "If I were
" instead of the incorrect but more common "If I was
Also I use whom, as in "asked by whom". This looks very outdated to native speakers but I can't help it because the distinctiom who/whom is very real to me
There is probably more
It's the same for Swiss German and Swiss standard German, which is mainly used in written form or in schools
In Swiss German, we put "the" in front of names, but that's wrong in Swiss standard German
In German countries we have coloured little cheap "reclam" books
Most are yellow, these are for I think mostly literature with open copy right (but not only)
Orange ones are in German and another language (left side italian, right side German), red ones are only in another language and the blue ones are for secondary literature about a work of literature
Very similar to bird language is the German "Löffelsprache" (spoon language)
Every vowel (including the Umlaute ä, ö and ü) gets doubled and you put a "lew" between them
So "a" becomes "**a**lew**a**", "ö" becomes "**ö**lew**ö**" and so on
"Das ist Löffelsprache" -> Dalewas ilewist Lölewöffelewelspralewachelewe
"This is spoon language" -> Thilewis ilewis spolewoolewon lalewangulewualewagelewe
Interesting
I have never heard of this before
It's not really as popular as it used to be, it was big with teenagers in the mid 2000's maybe
I thought the same, it reminded me of [this]
a bit off-topic, but I live in Japan at the moment, where one also drives on the left side of the road, usually people also walk on the left side past each other
It's not super strict though, and there are lots of places like train stations, where you walk on the right
The closest I can come up with would be the [Reisläufer]
I thought at the "Senn". They are kinda Cowboys in the alps, protecting their cows
But they even lived harsher lives than cowboys
One of them was Willheln Tell, who killed an evil tyrann
Fair, but I've never seen weapons being used as a defining characteristic of an Alpöhi or Senn
If I remember correctly "Wucher" doesn't apply to prices but interest rates
"Because I am not a fuckin' alcoholic" is an appropriate response to that
(I don't believe that having a single beer is alcoholism, but such a question from a waiter is highly inappropriate and deserves a response)
I'm not that experienced with german law, but we have something similar here in Switzerland too
(Art
20 [OR] and Art
21 [OR] Here it only applies if you sell the product to a higher price by abusing the other persons emergency or their
inexperience
I'm pretty sure you can choose whatever price you want if these don't apply
Maybe it's the same in Germany
I‘d say the education system in finnland
Ours is good but I heard finnlands is better
the prices from litterally any other country please it's like 3
50 for a coke here
Hungarian Beer
legal system from Norway
as well as the aspect of being situated in Scandinavia
I did BritRail last summer and it all worked out better than I expected
But yeah, I couldn't really go to rural areas because the way would have always been something like"5 changes, 30min waiting period each change"
Here you really can get pretty much anywhere with public transport but on the flip side it's expensive as fuck
We can trade bank accounts
I doubt that you have less
Wait
You don‘t take your shoes off when entering a house in germany
I assumed that would be similar to here
yeah but shit hella expensive here so id take prices from any other country
damn that’s long
here everything later than 1 minute is considered extremely late
Yes, that's why I had to skip Cornwall
I went to Brighton but I couldn't go further west from there because then the trains always would have gone back to London
i wish hahahah
Yess, I actually went with my parents when I was younger and we drove all the way from London to west end and back
I wanted to go again because it's really nice but I realised that it's not really possible with public transport
I couls get all the way from Oban to York in one day, so that was nice
We have a few here but it's more of a region tonregion thing so I say the ones for my canton, Valais : Wiliamine (pear liquor) and Abricotine (apricot liquor)
They both taste good and go really well with dessert
Well
Absinth was invented in Switzerland
But it's not a common thing we drink here
And in the east we have a herb liquor called Appenzeller that tastes a bit like Jagermeister
Limoncello is really amazing
Love that stuff ice cold in the summer heat
Yep, love these two ! In the Jura region Absinthe is also very popular
Yes but wouldn't damassine be the regional liquor of the Jura ?
Maybe for the Canton itself yeah, but I was thinking more of the whole of the Jura mountains, since I know absinthe is made in Neuchâtel but also in France
Ah yes makes sense then
For me, as a French speaker, I find it quite easy though I hate my accent and can’t seem to get rid of it ..
I've had English classes since 2nd grade and I'd say I've managed to pretty much be fluent by now
(end of high school)
English is one of the easiest languages to get on a (very) basic level of communication
You don't need to know as much of the language and its rules in order to be able to hold simple conversations like many other languages do
It's of course quite a different story when you want to obtain a higher, more eloquent level of it, then it isn't nearly as easy
I learnt both French and English in school as foreign languages
French started in 3rd grade and English in 7th
Within ~4 years, I spoke and understood English better than French, which I had at the time been learning for already 8 years, even though I lived in a part of my country that spoke French quite often
Today I speak and understand French well, but it's nowhere near my level of English that's quite close now to that of a native speaker
Using "was" instead of "were" in a hypothetical
r/shitamericanssay
It's was for something presumee true in the past and were for a hypothetical
For example:
I was just having dinner
Versus
If I were having dinner, I would be eating
It's fine, don't worry about it
There's the official website of SwissTopo [map
geo
admin
ch]
It's probably the most accurate maps of Switzerland out there (way better than google maps for example) , but it has no function to plan journeys or similar
It's more a geographical tool
&#x200B;
Edit: Yes, the Swiss government uses the domain [admin
ch] which I find kinda cool
For the federal level, there's the maps of [Swisstopo] that includes infrastructure information but also historical maps and satellite pictures
For the canton of Zurich, I know the [GIS browser] with detailed zone information
I guess all cantons must have something like this because building regulations go through this level
The city of Zurich has its own portal that includes a map from the 18th century: [Stadtplan]
I don't know what other people use but I use [map
search
ch] on my computer or the search
ch app on my phone
I also have Swisstopo on my phone but I don't use it too much because it uses a lot of mobile data afaik
These two are only for Switzerland
For Austria I use [basemap
at] I also use OpenStreetMap, though not that often
Lastly, I also use HereWeGo (former HereMaps) because it has a download feature so I can use maps offline
I only use the maps from the Swiss government for my planning of hikes, cross-country skiing, cycling, and snowshoeing: [Switzerland Mobility]
They are incredibly accurate, and you can also download sections of the map for off-line use
In addition, the tool allows you to create your own routes and download them on the GPS-tracked app, with very accurate distances and even timings
I use [Komoot] quite a bit for planning hiking, biking or photography trips
What they get right (that I miss in almost all other route planning applications) is that I can plan a route on the desktop, on my *big screen, with keyboard and mouse,* and later use it for turn-by-turn navigation via the mobile app
It's not free (except the first single region of your choice), but their pricing is really fair compared to all the yearly subscription bullshit you see nowadays: 30€ for the whole world
One time payment, lifetime updates
Well there is [basemap
at] in Austria
I usually use it when I'm in Austria
You could also try OpenStreetMap or HereWeGo which also has a download feature for offline use
Never gave the "admin
ch" much thought but it's definitly awesome
Oh wow, I’m surprised by the results from Northern Ireland
Reddit makes it sound like the only thing standing in the way of a united Ireland is England
But obviously there’s more to the story than that
1 CHF - nothing really, a (small) piece of candy maybe
10 CHF - a Sandwich
100 CHF - 4 - 5 medium sized pizzas (~32 cm) from my local delivery place (the cheapest Pizza at my local delivery guy is 18
50 CHF and the most expensive 30
00 CHF - including the delivery fee)
1 CHF = 0
91 Euro = 1
09 USD
CHF 1
-: about half a kilo to a kilo of carrots
CHF 10
-: 200g of a cut of beef (at most)
CHF 100
-: about a week worth of food for a two person household
1 chf - no weed
10 chf - 1 gram of weed
100 chf - 11 grams of weed
>1 packet ? (plastic jar
I think you're looking for "cup"
1Chf gets you roughly a liter of milk
You can also buy 6 liters of mineral water
Or a kilo of flour
1 CHF can still get you about a pound of basic vegetables (or), a cheap loaf of bread, or 1 kg of cheap rice
Also most (supermarket) sandwiches I've seen don't go over CHF 5
It would have to be a high quality sandwich
You can get a bottle of water/ ice tea for less than
1 CHF
or the cheapest 100g chocolate bar for
50 CHF
At Migros though
I assume you haven't ever been poor (for Swiss standards)
You can buy a lot more with 1 CHF than you think
further down the english n is for aNywhere like N-ywhere
So maybe they translated it to N-dlich
We learnt cursive writing in primary school, never used it in and after secondary
Print in 1st grade and cursive in 2nd if my memory still holds up
Printed from 4 to 8 years old then cursive
we learned the cursive script but I was never really good at it so I still use print
I remember the same but they changed it now to what they call a Basisschrift, I think - a mix between the two
The general world-wide rule applies:
If someone at a tourist attraction asks/wants/gives something from/to you, politely tell them to fuck off
I love iit, worst thing about living in Switzerland is that there's no good seafood :( if I'm on vacation somewhere even remotely close to an ocean, seafood is all I'm gonna have
Never had it but doesn't sound strange to me
Would definitely eat this
Bern: Everything is slow there
Zürich: Only Bankers, Coke and Hookers
Aargau: Bad drivers
Wallis: Drunk at every time of the day
Appenzell Innerrhoden
They have incest going on, didn't give women the right to vote until they were forced to let them vote by federal court until 1990
They are extremely conservative
Rental cars usually have a licence plate from AI, so if you see an AI licence plate it's most likely a rental car because there are not a lot of people who live there and I think they rarely leave
People from Zurich are considered arrogant, but I think that's just because the others are jealous
And then there are a lot of things like that about every region because everyone makes fun about each other
People from Schaffhausen, St
Gallen and Thurgau supposedly have a terrible dialect
And so on and so on and so on
I don't know what the non-German speaking parts of the country are up to though, we usually don't joke about those
Then there is Graubünden, which is the same thing again but smaller, one example is that they say that Surselva is the incest region
A friend od my dad once called it a developing region (Entwicklungsland)
Edit: oh and people from Bern speak very slowly and everything is just slower there, people walk slowly etc
Bern - the slow ones (and their versatile word äuä)
Zürich - rich snobs that do cocaine lol
Appenzell Innerrhoden / Ausserrohen - Incest
Graubünden - weed smokers and volvos (and accent)
Thurgau - their weird accent
Wallis - their not understandable accent
Aargau - not being able to drive and wearing white socks in sandals
We just meme the whole country
I have a winter house in Florida
I go there for a month or so a year
I'm fine with America, but I wouldn't want to actually live there in a permanent fashion
I think everything that has been written so far by others explain the reasons why I feel this way, so I will not bother typing them again
Are you asking long term or short term
From the comments you got I think most people thought you were asking long term
I've been spending a couple of months in the US every year for maybe 5 years now
My brother also did two semesters of high school in the US
If we are talking short term, yes I would happily spend a few months there
Not in the same general area like I do now tho, I would travel around
There are aspects of the US I really like
I'm interested in your culture and people, the landscape can be gorgeous, wide open spaces as far as the eye can see, amazing national parks, iconic architecture, a lot of variety, there's a lot to love
However, if we are talking long term, I'm not sure I'd be comfortable living there
I think I would have to lower my living standards if I was to survive there on my own
I want to leave home as soon as I turn 18 and without my parents' help I highly doubt I'd be able to afford health care in the US
And needing healthcare is not like a remote possibility for me
I need therapy, I'm on medication, need injections and to see a chiro regularly
I remember health isurance being annoying to sort out even back when my brother, who is healthy and not a mess like me, had to spend a year there
I'm no expert on this stuff but I do know my parents pay for global coverage and even for global there's two options: everywhere or everywhere + US
That should give you an idea of how expensive the US is in that regard
Apart from that, I like to walk and I use public transportation a lot
Having to drive constantly is not something I would enjoy
In fact, the few weeks per year we're in the US we're in Cali 80% of the time and the traffic kills me every time
I also think walking around is overall less safe in the US
At the same time I hate gated communities and the burbs
They can be nice and relaxing for a few days but by week 2 there's nothing left to do besides driving to the mall
Additionally, spending longer periods of time in the US I'd be slightly worried about:
- open carry / gun control in general
- shootings
- racial hate
Closest I've been to any of that was: spring break 2018 I was landing in LAX when the YouTube shooting was unfolding, walked next to a guy open carrying in a convenience store in Colorado, a few stupid arguments about race among teenagers
So, nothing major but just not stuff I would want long term in my life
No I wouldn't cuz you guys don't have healthcare
You tell me
There are a lot of regulations for non citizens to own property in the US, and also significant tax issues if you sell it and make a profit
I had an attorney associated with my Swiss bank assist in the documents and legal parts of things
I wouldn't even consider it without trusted local legal advice
I have insurance and a company that takes care of the place so they handle all the preparation of something like that is going to happen
Fondue
(Or raclette, but I mean, you don't have to wait and reflect on your life each time with a fondue, you can just eat and eat and eat)
älplermagronen, I could eat tonnes of that
potato, macaroni, cheese and sometimes sour cream mixed and baked
top with fried onions and optionally eat with apple sauce
I'm too lazy to make a fondue and stir it constantly
I just make microwave-raclette
It's much faster than a stupid raclette oven
Switzerland is officially called Confederatio Helvetica as to not put any of the 4 national languages into an advantage
The helvetia one makes a lot of sense because the latin name is confoederatio helvetica
It still is imprinted on our coins
Edit: typo
Yup
We have "Millionhair", "4 Haareszeiten" (4 Jahreszeiten = 4 seasons) or "Haarmonie" (Harmonie = harmony)
And those are just off the top of my head
Der Besuch der alten Dame maybe
Or Die Physiker
Definitely something by Dürrenmatt
hedgehogs and martins are all iv ever seen,switzerland
I am not such a fan because of many reasons listed above and below
First, Far to many brave workers have died, building stadiums that will be abandoned as soon as the tournament ends
Secondly, the overwhelming heat surely isn’t going to be ideal to play and I don’t think every player is going to find it "great", to play in such extreme heat
And, thirdly, in my perspective, it just won’t feel as great as let’s say Brazil, like it seems like money is what got Qatar to host this World Cup in the first place (even though that may not be true btw)
I don’t know, it just doesn’t feel right for it to be there
It bothers me a lot
Russia had at least a serious experience with football that can permit us to say "let's not talk politics", and they put everything in line for us not to be triggered with their normal political practices
But fuck: QATAR
Out of every arab-speaking countries that love football, we choose Qatar ? Slavery, air-conditionned stadiums ? Winter games ? They don't even have the population to fill thoses stadiums, what will they do, force indian workers to sit ? And what, with their expensives a-f prices and limitations on alcohol ? They will spend 100bl of dollars on this
This is ridiculous
Well
Here everything :
"le Saint-Empire romain germanique", meaning the Holy Germanic Roman Empire
“Between 1804 and 1806”, gotta love Napoleon :)
No, we don't have that for two reasons
Firstly, it's quite useless because average people usually don't use these made-up words (as you have pointed out yourself)
I think for most people, it just comes across as silly and patronizing
Secondly, Switzerland and also the German-speaking world as a whole (Germany, Austria) have quite a different approach to language than for example France
Politically, our countries are much more federalist and de-centralized and this attitude is mirrored in the way we treat/view language
Contrary to countries such as France which have a very prescriptive approach to their language, German-speaking countries tend to be much more descriptive
In Switzerland, for example, we don't even have an official standard
The diversity of local dialects is valued very highly and although some people find one dialect prettier than another, no dialect is considered "more important" or "more valuable" than another one
On public TV, for example, you will hear Swiss people from all regions with all kinds of dialects
In this context, English loanwords aren't viewed as a corruption of our language but more of a new addition
Swiss has countless of French loanwords and most Swiss people are proud of this rather than uncomfortable about it
The strong French influence is viewed as an unique trait of our language
But the times of Napoleon are gone and now English is the lingua franca, and that should be okay
On an emotional level, I understand people who want to preserve their language
However, linguistically this simply doesn't make any sense
Languages will always change and there's nothing we can do about it
As long as there will be cultural interactions between different countries and ethnicities, there will be linguistic change (and perhaps even without it)
Coming up with Korean or French words for English loanwords is like building a sand castle at the beach
No matter how beautiful you think it is, the next morning you return, it won't be there anymore
Thus, I think a better way of dealing with the situation is to embrace new loanwords in a creative way
For example in German, English loanwords are oftentimes conjugated as though they were regular German verbs
Sometimes, a loan expression is so thoroughly integrated into German that most native speakers don't even realize anymore that it was once "stolen". The same happened with words like "tea" from Chinese or "alcohol" from Arabic, which in the long run have made our language so much richer
Btw
: regarding North Korea's loan of "deutschland", I didn't know this but it makes a lot of sense given the close relationship
You probably know this but during the 1960s and 1970s, North Korea hired a lot of Germans from East Germany to help them with engineering etc
I wouldn't be surprised if more German loanwords could be found in the North Korean language/dialect
You folks need a word for a tank
> In Switzerland, for example, we don't even have an official standard
Isn't the [Swiss Standard German] an official standard
It doesn't invalidate your overall point, of course
In Polish there is a nice word for that: "gumiaki", which is native to the language
Unless you frown upon "guma" as a loanword, but that's kinda far-fetched
And samojed (self-eating)
Condone and condemn
I haven't actually mixed these up, but I still think you're asking for trouble having made these words so similar to each other ;-)
In German, it's also common to write words together but for some reason people seem to forget this and the result just looks atrocious
How can anyone in their right mind look at such an atrocity and not throw up
I mean, English has [arm ankles] so
Atm Alain Berset, minister of heakth, but only in memes
Not for everyone, but on the tabloid side of things Diana is held up as a saint far more than anyone else
This is the best one so far
It doesn't seem to be as common as in surrounding countries thankfully
I think it's partly due to our more consensus-based and restrained sociopolitical culture, which makes the opinion of experts still held in very high regard
But homeopathy (which is a legal scam that I can't believe it's available in every regular (!) apothecary, which means it should banned as false advertising because the market hasn't succeeded in relegating it into fringe mysticism areas where it could be maybe tolerated as placebo) is unfortunately common
Denials related to climate change are most common, mostly because accepting it would mean people have to change their habits
But they like driving their cars, eating lots of meat and flying to other continents, so they'll find excuses
Some will say yes climate change exists but it's not man made
Others will say well yes it exists but there's nothing we can do
Others again will say China, India and the USA should fix it, us being too small to make a difference
Some will say climate change exists but it's natural
I'd much rather these people just be honest and say yes, I'm helping making the planet unhospitable for humanity but my steak and my SUV are more important to me
Flat out denying the existence of climate change I've never encountered
I mean there are people who believe Bielefeld is real
I mean, pff, come on
it’s really sad how many europeans believe the earth is round when in fact it doesn’t even exist
r/noearthsociety
Well, i mean, no
Cursing is way less funny in englidh than it is in swissgerman
Calling someone a "Hure Schofseggel" or a "Soudübbl" is way less offensive than english swears
Yes even speaking in "high german" makes me a little bit different then i usually am
I get a deeper more attractive voice somehow
I glaub des is bei fast jedem so :)
Wennd wegen dem flair frogst, hob in Österreich gwohnt haha

Some manual labor jobs in Switzerland can pay surprisingly well, even though they're generally considered working class jobs
For example I used to know a guy who works on construction sites
He began at the very bottom of the hierarchy and by age 25 or so he had worked himself up to become a foreman
Together with his compensations for lots of extra hours and occasional weekend work, he made over 8,000 Franks (€7,400), which is really good money for someone without any higher education
Zurich is even more exspensive than the rest of Switzerland, bad comparison imho
But generally you're right
Well, double prices are partially due to a really weak Euro
Exchange rate used to be around 1
65 chf per euro, now it’s almost 1:1
If you calculate prices in „average minuets you have to work to buy item x“ (ie local purchasing power) Switzerland/Swiss cities often top the list of most affordable places
Food and any services where you have to pay for someone with a Swiss salary (barber, cleaner and whatnot) are very expensive
But I‘m amazed how expensive something like an iPhone must be for our neighbors
Higher price due to VAT while they earn significantly less
Yeah that's about right
Subway, Burgerking or takeout pizza (turkish ones or dominos) are all about that price range
McDonald's a bit cheaper at about 15
Real italian takeout pizza about 25, depending on the location
Döner usually about 10
Our group of 4-5 ordering takeout for movie night is usually about 120
- and we don't order crazy expensive stuff
Local meat is pretty expensive but at least we have good conditions for the animals
Spotify is about 13
-/Month, Netflix 12-21 depending on which one
Beer is 6-8, coffee 3-5 depending on location
Zurich is expesnsive while more rural areas are usually cheaper (except from mountain regions of course)
Meanwhile electronics are the same if not cheaper than in Germany
Some cloths are really cheap
And if we go on vacation we're quite well off compared to the local economy as for us everything is cheap abroad
And Zurich is even more expensive
That’s also a consequence of a weak Euro combined with a strong Swiss franc
At its highest conversion used to be almost 1
70 CHF per euro, now it’s around 1
05 CHF per Euro
For some people cross border shopping is definitely part of their shopping routine, depends a bit on how close they live to the border and/or how much they value their time to drive across the border
In reality Switzerland became successful due to early industrialization and adaption of those early efforts to other industries
Switzerland had one of the highest/the highest GDP per capita by the end of the 19th century
Today, banking is just one of many fields, others include nutrition (nestle), pharmaceuticals (Roche, novartis), agricultural chemicals (syngenta), flavours and scents (givaudan, firmenich), engineering (abb) etc
Yes it's generally pretty nice to have it this way around
However, it also means that if you're out of a job you have to find more money than if you're out of a job in another country
And it also means that most online freelancing platforms / remote jobs abroad pay like shit
$7/h might be pretty ok if you live in Turkey but here it's just not worth it, as stupid as it sounds
But for those cases we have good social security I guess
I think it's about 1000 + apartment + health insurance
Apartment generally has to be as cheap as possible but they won't force you to instantly relocate, just as soon as possible
And you can get reduced fees for health insurance if you don't earn much
So the total amount varies (and I think they pay apt/Insurance directly)
And it really varies on location and is calculated individually but this is more or less considered to be the Existenzminimum (existance minimum)
If you're interested you can find more detailed lists of how that 1000 is coming together online
Edit: If you lose uour job you usually get 2 years of unemployment which is 80% of your former income
After that you get "Sozialhilfe" with the above mentioned stuff
You do have to pay that back (not the unemployment though) once you're earning enough again but, once again, this depends on location (gemeinde/canton)
Zürich: rich and expensive, the one big city of the country
Economical centre, night life, snobby people, the zoo
Geneva: also rich and expensive, diplomatic center , very international city, full of French, snobby people, protestantism and nuclear research
Bern: the capital, pretty old town, swimming in the river, the bears
Lausanne: pretty view of the Alps, the only underground of the country, Olympic capital, drug dealers everywhere
Basel: museums, convention centers
Luzern: tourist hub, nice old bridge
Zermatt: expensive ski station
Davos: expensive ski station
Gstaad: expensive ski station
Cran-Montana: expensive ski station
all I know about German cities is that Bielefeld isn't real
Zuerich: you can kinda smoke weed around and nobody is gonna bother stopping you
Bern: diplomats and politicians feeling lost among people who walk around like they just rollend out of bed
Up from murder capital
Congrats
I can confirm that we here in Zurich are all high
Makes the place more exciting
Hope it goes away from a political union to a solely economical one
So switzerland actually has any reason to join
Also the more countries leave the better for switzerland

Hmmm
Why is it that way
The name Silvan also originates from there even tho it spread a lot to the rest of the german speaking parts of switzerland
Neapolitans are really some very regional patriots and superstitious people
I heard a phrase that sums it up very well, "Napoli ain‘t Italy".
I grew up in Poland, I've been living in Switzerland for 10 years
As long as I am anywhere in Europe I am at home
I would prefer to be in European Union, but the preference is not strong enough to give ip my life in Switzerland

Happy cake day to you too
If you like big coins, let me introduce you to the swiss franc
there's this one channel that's an American living here with her Swiss husband and its funny for me to watch because they talk about things that are normal for me but not for her
I forgot her name though
I think you mean "How to Switzerland" if im not wrong
[This one I guess ?] The song could’ve still been okay if it wasn’t for her wrong notes and that terrible staging
I mean, it looks like she just really needs to pee and is trying to hold it in
Teenage life really is horrible to listen to
In my experience as a Swiss, I found Austrians more friendly and good-natured
Germans a bit more forceful and direct
Well Germans kinda have a hard time being proud of their history, even more so because they get shamed and denounced yearly
Wait, seriously
In english, no
In german we already to that
In German, we always said "Tschechien" rather than "Tschechische Republik". I then got used to "Czech Republic" in English but found it a bit weird
The name change seems logical to me because of that but for some reason I'm just struggling a bit when pronouncing "Czechia" in English
For sure Czechia, logical short name
And it sounds similar or identical in most of languages
Czech Republic sound beautiful to me
Czechia just doesn't sound right to me
We say République Tchèque in French, so I ise that version in English as well
Badass as the French Republic ;-)
It takes time to get used to it, I didn't like it, now I love it
[www
amazingczechia
com]
And the Czech Republic is being confused with the Chechen Republic
[Boston marathon bombing]
ČR is Čínská republika, Čečenská republika, Čuvačská republika, CR is Costa Rica
It's pronounced Čekija as in Lithuanian
My Slovak friends call it Česko
In Swiss German it's Tschechie and I have hated it in 1993, sounded like Asia to me
Today I use it exclusively
It's not a name change, but short name registration
You are not used to it
Give it ten more years
Czechoslovakia was called awful and ridiculous
The  Czech Republic can describe our country only after 1993
Formal name will never be a brand
CZECHIA is handy and easy to remember
The **short** (geographic) name of a country cannot be **substituted** by its formal (**political**) name, which is **transient** and **ignores** the **historic continuity** of a given state territory because it is limited only to the existing state form
While the Czech Republic has only **existed since 1993**, the Czech state has existed in various forms and under different political names for more than **one thousand year**s. As such, the political name can **never fully replace** a permanent geographic name that does not change in response to changing state forms in a particular territory
The need for a proper short name is demonstrated by the fact that the Czech Republic is often erroneously shortened to **Czech, Czech rep
or Czechrep, CR, C. Rep
Republic CZ or Czecho
** In many cases, foreigners continue to use the name **Czechoslovakia**, although the country has not existed since 1993
“Made in the Czech Republic” has failed to become a familiar brand around the world because it is ambiguous and too long
Cechia
Check out EU country list
We still use Tschechei here
Don't really have an alternative so not dated yet
It takes time to get used to it
I have hated the Swiss-German Tschechie, today I love it
I didn't like it as well, today I love it, and it sounds similar or identical in most other languages
Both equally i guess
Myself i use both completely randomly
It takes time, Czechoslovakia was called awful and ridiculous 4 years after its foundation
Check out Library of Congress archive , Czechia was used pretty often before WWII as the denomination of the western part of Czechoslovakia
Polish and Czech have been almost identical languages in the middle ages
Oh i didn‘t know that
Thanks for the info
National Geographic 1921, Karel and Josef Capek, 1922
No, very happy with Czechia ;-)
Česko
Böhmen=  Čechy,   Česko = Tschechien
Similar in Switzerland, older folks say Tschechei, younger Tschechien, btw, Tschechei is the same like Türkei od Slowakei, but was discredited by the usage of Nazis, it has a negative connotation
It Hitler would say Banana instead, Banana would be a bad word today
:;-)
The cantonal war flags of old all have that flamed pattern btw
You still see the Bernese one every now and again here
Not necessarily
Of course the German Reich was not really sympathetic to the democratic movements but that its flag got reappropriated by right-wing movements had more to do with a legal workaround
The original Nazi flags are banned in Germany, so they took the next best thing which were the German Reich flags
But hadn't more to do with the hope that the Nazis would reinstate the monarchy
I was more referring to the modern movements which don't have a particular monarchistic touch
The other dude explained how it is more about someone else's attention aka to lose *their attention*
It's not about fearing to lose anything but specifically the attention or love or favor of someone
Not only were you wrong but also unnecessarily cocky
Or can you give me just one single good reason why you reacted with this attitude
Tech/research/banking: Zürich
Diplomacy/banking: Geneva
Chemical/pharmaceutical: Basel
Sports/hospitality management: Lausanne
Geneva: commodity traders, diplomats, bankers, physics scientists, secondary school teachers
It is called the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine in official places like the Swiss public health agency, but in the press and common discussion it is also sometimes called the Pfizer vaccine
I suspect that is rather for brevity than the desire to transfer credit from one company or country to another
Just 5: German, French, Italian, Spanish and English
English, Deutsch, Schwiitzerdütsch, Suomi, Svenska, Norge, Dansk, Italiano, Français, Русский, Español, and others I don't remember
Yeah, Schwizerdütsch took “merci” from French, I’m not sure if I would count it as it’s exactly the same word
Maybe
I don’t care much, since it’s pronounced the same, and written swiss does not exist officially, so I suppose both would be valid ways to write it
I have only heard “merci” spoken, never written, so I really don’t know
I reckon most people know it as the U2 song without understanding the context/history of the song
Doubt the marketing team was mindful of this
Jack Sparrow saying «You've clearly never been to Singapore» in the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie

Singapore airlines A380, because i saw it when i was like 10 and i was fascinated
Wow a top comment from switzerland
me too
I actually couldn't believe it either when I looked it up
Thought it was released sometime around 2010-2011
It's crazy
We are the only European country (that I know of) that never had a native aristocracy during our independent period
I.e. there never were Swiss kings, dukes or counts (while we were Switzerland)
The closest you can get are the patricians that ruled the cities, but those can be regarded more as a mix between wealth and blood rather than purely blood
There is one notable exception though (which I am sure is a famous fact here): the one actually notable aristocratic house of Swiss origin are the Habsburgs
They pissed off to Austria though as soon as they got more sizeable lands outside their Swiss core
The loss of their ancestral castle to a bunch of peasant revolutionaries was a sore point for them during the medieval period
Well, our "national sports" (aka
traditional Swiss disciplines) are [Hornussen] [Schwingen] and [Steinstossen] Of the three my favorite to watch is Schwingen, but Hornussen as a team sport could also be a good choice
I saw someone else already mentioned it but I think Switzerland would also be able to compete in [Floorball] (yes Sweden and Finland are obviously the best but [we're holding up]
Eating cheese
or when you think of a real sport probably "Schwingen" or "Hornissen"
We used to play floorball a lot in school, it brings back memories ! Another swiss sport we would play was [Tchoukball] Apparently now Taiwan is the world leader, but I think we could still defend our colours pretty well
Cashier here
At our checkouts there are four scanners: one on the bottom, two on the side and one from the top (plus the hand scanner of course)
Most products have multiple barcodes
The scanners can read the barcodes near-instantly, as long as it isn't obstruced, damaged or folded (Looking at you, fruits & vegetables section)
We can also make it so that the next scanned barcode will ve added X amount of times (Number plus "amount" button, then grab 'em all and pull 'em over)
I also like to spin the product a little, so that more surface is visible to the scanners
In conclousion; the chackouts are stupidly optimised and you can go crazy fast if you do it right
Yeah, it happens a lot that two customers are still packing up and I'm left building a tower of products from the third, but I haven't gotten an unlucky streak yet where people have to wait because of it
Depends
If it 20
85 for example and they give me a twenty and some change then I'm glad they do it
But if it's like 1
25 and they hand me a 100
- why not even paying attention to me (these go hand in hand most of the time) then I'm a little annoyed, but I've gotten desensitized
The Anti-PowerPoint Party is a political party whose goal it is to stop the use of PowerPoint and other presentation programs because they allegedly cause economic damage to our nation
Schweizer Hanf Partei = swiss hemp party
Two dudes whose goal is to legalise weed
The only true party of Switzerland
"in power" would be contradictory to half of their name
Bulgaria, everything below that is medium or small
Norway/Sweden/Finland
their population isn't huge but they've got quite some territory
Geographically I would say Iran is the first country that makes the jump above medium-sized
Pop-wise I would say >50 mil is "big", so anything a bit more populous than Spain
Area
Of course
Do we
I’ve seen family zones, but I don’t recall any "quiet zone"
Only in first class wagons
I was just thinking that I haven't seen one in a long time
Maybe because people tend to be quiet anyway unless it's the family zone
I guess that explains why I've never noticed =/
I've seen the family cars though
I imagine that is its own special level of hell
Aren’t first class already the quiet wagons
No, they are their own thing:
I'm from Basel, which I love, but I also really love Berne, it's so pretty and the whole vibe there is great
it's hard to choose, Luzern is pretty, but very touristic
As is lugano
Zurich is quite nice too
I haven't been in Geneva or lausanne
I probably have to say Poschiavo and its surrounding villages
such a pretty and remote part of switzerland
I'm not going to say mine (Geneva) because that would be lame, so I'll say my second favourite city, which is Lugano in canton Ticino
Bern
I enjoy that city so much each time I visit
The deep river valley cutting across the city is so beautiful
Sadly I only know train stations in Basel
the traffic is usually bad around Zurich, because nobody drives into Zurich cause they know that that'd cause traffic
There is r/BUENZLI which is kinda funny and nearly exclusively Swiss German but I think that's it
I don't have Instagram so I don't know what is going on there
Oh nice I was looking for ways to relearn german, memes might motivate me
Gondola was created by an Italian dude
It's based off spurdo, yes, like spurdo was based on pedobear who was based on kuma bear
I'm subbed to a lot of subreddits, especially a lot of random ones like r/BreadStapledToTrees
The problem with that is that generally the wierd things are very American
Someone once drew a snoo at their school and other people found it and posted it
Here, very few use Reddit
That would never happen here
Jungfraujoch (glacier saddle in the Swiss Alps)
If I had known how expensive that is I probably would have appreciated it a bit more
That guy's funny, dank je wel for the link
I didn't even think about the train all the way from Interlaken
We hiked up to Kleine Scheidegg with school and only took the Jungfraubahn
Because it isn't a school trip in Switzerland without hiking
There‘s sex ed in primary (6th grade), in middle school (8th grade) and also in universities sometimes
school of course
but I also asked my parents about it before that
My parents never had any "talk" with me, I learned it mostly from school and porn
Here it was also done in 4th and during Gymnasium too
They‘re about 12 y/o, so thats ok i think
Thats when they start puberty
It‘s not just sex ed, but more like „becoming and adult“ where they also talk about how boys and girls work
If your Swiss, catholic, unmarried and finished recruit school you can serve in the Vatican "army" (a.k.a. the Swiss Guard)
Even thought Switzerland was never a catholic only country (currently 26% protestant), your not allowed to fight for another country (unless you have two passports) and Switzerland is  neutral
Beside that Switzerland also protects Liechtenstein, but with the regular army
Not really a relation, but there’s a weirdly high number of occurrences where Switzerland has accidentally invaded or attacked Lichtenstein
This occurred mostly because there aren’t much bordermarkings
Switzerlands militia trains a lot in regular civilian territory so a few times groups of soldiers walked over the border without noticing
I think they are really used to it by now and we have a deal to protect them anyway, so not much harm done, except for that time when we shot some rockets at them
(Gonna put some links down later if anyone is interested)
Edit:
Kim Jong-Un went to school in Bern and apparently he can speak Swiss German
Do you mean Berne instead of Zurich
[Obligatory Tom Scott video]
I'm half German swiss and half italian
I love both countries and before Covid I used to cross borders quite often
I gladly accept both identities, when It comes to behaviour I'm more italian but when It comes to politics I'm definetely Swiss
Let's just say I'm 60% italian and 40% Swiss
The fact that Swiss identity isn't really tied to language and ethnicity helps a lot
Born and raised in Switzerland
My father is german and my mom is half swiss and half norwegian
I never felt any connection to germany even tho technically im mostly german and i have been there a lot of times
Im more interested about my norwegian part
I also started leatning norwegian and hopefully i can go visit Norway this summer
I don‘t know if this counts but at the Vienna Congress of 1815, the great powers of Europe declared Switzerland a neutral country and it has defined who we are and kept us out of all the following wars, at least militarily
Yes they still lost, but damn did the soviets fuck up their attack thus making them look crazy weak
I think in general languages here are taught in ways that hardly reflects how people actually speak
During highschool we studied german by reading old poetry
I can still say the whole Erlkönig by Goethe, but it has hardly ever been useful
This turned a bit into a critique of how languages are taught in general, but for both english, german and french i got out of school unable to say much and had to learn them by myself
Well, basically all of my French
8 years in school, no chance I can follow a conversation or participate
All the crazy grammar we learned and in the end the French don't even use it
At least for Japanese you can apply it 1:1 and the only disconnects I had in English was due to British-American differences
Ye i'm from the deep south, our german was taught almost exclusively via poetry and history (we read a lot about Wikinger and ancient german paganism)
Moreover, it was hochdeutsch so it ended up being nearly useless in Switzerland
I guess it depends heavily on your country's size and population density
Since Switzerland is so small you can always get to the nearest city pretty quick, so we don't really have a "middle of nowhere".
I would say somewhere around the Alps maybe
Aargau/Thurgau
Derborence in the canton of Valais, or Lauwil in the canton of Basel-land
There are many
And also St
Urban, canton of Lucerne
Have you ever heard of derborence vs or lauwil bl
They are pretty far off
Derborence has a Postauto (modern version of the stagecoach) four times a day (twice in the morning and twice in the evening)
It's the opposite for me, I really want to visit the countryside and just walk through small villages in England haha
The pattern in Switzerland seems to be that young people (in their twenties) move to the cities to study or work, but young families (aka
People in their thirties) move out of the cities to give their children a nicer environment to grow up in
Because we've got a decent public transport network it's usually not a problem to live in small, rural towns and commute into the city for work
Also, in most of Switzerland, a small village is like a 20min car drive from the nearest city, maximum
There’s obviously the signs around train tracks warning you of a danger of death, usually looking like [this] and there’s also the 'danger of avalanche' [signs]
Not really popular at all
The most popular is clearly football with ski, hockey and tennis (because of Federer) following
And yet funnily enough, gymnastics is the sport with the most active members
I think that even though it has the most members, it is less well known or popular because it is not talked about in the media
That's just my guess
I also knew a lot of people who did downhill mountain bike and even more who did athletics (athlétisme, I don't know if my translation is correct)
Milk yes, it goes in the fridge
Eggs no, they stay on the counter
Cold milk tastes good
You guys are missing on lactose-free milk though
It is sweeter
I use what we call a Swiss layout
It has the Z and Y swapped in location like a German and Austrian keyboard, but also has extra keys to allow one to have fast access for French, Italian and Swiss German special characters/accents
On some these are accessed via function/option key, but I prefer a larger format where they are individual buttons
Most Swiss keyboards do not have a key for ß, as we don't really use this, but some have it on there anyway
Like pretty much everyone in Switzerland, I use the standard Swiss keyboard, a QWERTZ layout
The layout is standardised over the entire country which means it has to work for all four languages
On your computer, you can either choose German (CH) or French (CH)
This only affects the three keys for Umlaute and accented letters: in the German setting, they write ä, ö and ü, in the French setting they write à, é and è. If you want to use the ones not corresponding to the chosen layout, press shift
For the capital variants, you either have to use caps lock or accent keys
For other letters with accents (most commonly used in Italian) also use accent keys
The ç is shift+4, for Ç you need an alt-code though
The Swiss keyboard isn't suitable for Germany and Austria because you can't type ß with it
Personally I mostly use the German variant of the Swiss layout, but I switch to the French one for typing in French
(I also used to write French with the keyboard from France (an AZERTY-keyboard) when I was bored in typing class
Don't you have an accent key on your keyboard
Then you could press that button first and then just type E. The Swiss keyboard for example has several accent keys
I concur, I tried typing on a french keyboard once, and never again
Ah, I remember seeing the name Lugdunum in the Asterix comics but never really realized that it’s latin for Lyon
That the Swiss are bat shit crazy about "privacy" but are completely fine disclosing everything under the sun to rent an apartment
Like bank statements, salary slips, passport/personal ID's, permits, etc
I've even heard of people submitting medical notices/ultrasounds in order to gain an "advantage".
"Grand" is such an Irish word to use like that in normal conversation, isn't it
It's common courtesy to bring something or at least offer to bring something
But yeah, once at a party every drink is open for all
A few others
Inviting someone over to their place during dinner time and only offering a bread, cheese, veggie platter
In the cultures I'm from that's generally a no-no and you should provide them a full meal
Hard to describe
It'd be one thing to submit these directly to the landlord/regie themselves
But a lot of times the regie requires the current tenant to collect the dossiers (documents) on behalf of them
I collected about 12 dossiers when moving out of my apartment (housing is insanely competitive in Geneva)
Had around 4 bankers apply (they didn't get the apartment by the way - which confirms the fact that it's not just about money)
They make ridiculous amounts of money by the way
Not in the U.S. And why it was common (in University) to crash a party and leave as soon as the keg was tapped/alcohol was done
Frats or people took great pride and making sure this doesn't happen and why there are times during the party when people are asked to contribute/or to do a "beer run". Which can be an adventure of it's own
Yeah
that's not cool with me
Too complicated to write out but the rules around watch manufacturers being able to claim a watch is "Swiss Made" is basically a lesson on loopholes that is constantly being changed
It is possible to 'sit out' your personal debt in prison
My brother is doing this annually, running up fare dodging fees from public transport and other little tickets, then going to prison for two or three weeks
And then, when he's released, they give him a train ticket for the day
(I do not condone this behavior, but - alas
- it is lawful and he obviously has more time than money
That went through
In Switzerland supermarkets weren't allowed to sell products (toys, clothing, etc) of stores that were shutdown
They were covered in plastic wrap or moved to a section with no access
Article 2 makes me sad
:( Erdogan isnt half the man Atatürk was
>60 percent of the value of timepieces needs to come from Switzerland for them to gain the title, up from 50 percent previously
>The new rules have loopholes as they allow watchmakers to include research and labor costs in their calculations
Meylan said that Moser could legally use the label by building a watch with Asian parts and adding just one metal plate in Switzerland that gets polished in a Swiss workshop for 10 hours
Well, admittedly, he's been in an addiction-based downward spiral for a decade now and has nothing to lose in terms of reputation or employment
So I guess he does it to have an option whenever he needs medical attention or a warm, safe place to stay (plus getting around without having to pay
It's not a dumb move, all things considered
Du bisch mis Härzchläppertäschli
Tiens, je cherchais justement un commentaire comme ça
German speaking swiss are basically constantly mocking each other for their different dialects
In the french speaking part there are different accents, but they’re seen as a very rural thing because they’re getting more and more lost in the larger cities
I think most people would notice it, but not really care about it that much
Might crack a joke about it, but I don’t think it’s seen as lower class or uneducated, for example many local politicians have an accent
Heavy accents are parodied a lot in media, to make a character more swiss sounding
At least in French speaking Switzerland, there's a whole part of humor based on other accents
I'd say that for a "television neutral" (which is just Geneva) accent, Valais is the land of Christian Constantin and drunk people, Fribourg is the land of the farmers, Vaud is kinda lost, Neuchâtel mainly doesn't exist and the Jura is the land of dumb people
But it's pretty easy to guess where the person is coming from based on their accent
Same here
Everyone understands (almost) every dialect, changing yours is almost seen as a sign of a weak character
Well, from what I've seen, France usually has a bad relationship with accents and foreign languages
For example, in high schools, speaking English, you're teased if your accent is "too good" because you're a show off
But I think the biggest barrier is just French people against themselves
Parisians despise everyone who's not having a Parisian accent, and the rest of France is just making fun of Parisians lol
Quick interested question: what do you mean by "kinda gay"?
Reddit is so interesting, I've never heard of that being the case for Switzerland
Maybe it depends on the assumed prestige of one's dialect, as well as if both parents are from the same region
Where did you grew up
For context, I grew up in the canton of Argovia, and almost my complete social circle has parents from different regions of Switzerland (or other countries)
Over the years, most moved to other places (mostly Zurich, Berne, and Basel), and almost everyone has taken up at least some local dialect, and lost some aspects of their original dialect
While it sometimes get commented upon, it's seems to be neutral or positive (esp
in the case of the ones picking up the Bernese dialect)
Wasn't aware that some people might judge it negatively
If you're talking about Swiss German, I always heard that every canton had its own dialect that was different and hard to understand if you're not from the same canton
At least that's what people from Fribourg complain about, and my grandmother always told me she was kind of being joked at first about her accent when she was working in Bern
I grew up in Bern
I think Argovia might be a special case because it‘s like a melting pot in the middle
Every canton does have its own dialect, but we all understand each other
Minor exceptions
that's normal, even now
It would he a shame for Freiburgisch-Bernische relations to not mock one another all the time
That makes sense, in my high school class only two students had a proper local dialect, and it was pretty distinct
Minor exceptions: valais
I think people who are eating alone might feel self concious, but no one who sees you alone actually cares
It’s pretty normal, especially during the day if you’re working/studying and just want to sit and eat without bother
[Malakoff] fried cheese ball; "[tree frogs] a type of cabbage roll; [capuns] also a roll but with chard; "[Spanish buns] a special pasty, which even most Swiss/locals forgot about
> Sahne Hering
Basically pickled herring in cream
They sell these in Swiss-Supermarkets
I think there are also small bits of apples & onions in the cream
The spanish buns have quite the fun history though
Rich people in Zürich really liked those for breakfast
They were made only in Baden (25km away) as it's a local specialty
The first railway line in Switzerland was built and connected those two cities
As it was very often used to bring back those spanish buns (spanisch brötli) this line was called the spanisch-brötli-bahn
It's not in service anymore, of course, but they bring out the old locomotive and wagons for the local festival in Baden every few years
Yes, but it’s even funnier considering that the buns originated from Milano in Italy, which was under Spanish rule at the time
Oh nice didn't know that
We have 12, 9 of them cultural sites and 3 natural sites
[Wikipedia has a list of all of them
Switzerland has nine world cultural heritage sites and three world natural heritage sites [
(Four of those are multinational)
Also we have 6 entries on the lists of intangible cultural heritage [
Two of those are buildings designed by Le Corbusier
But in total, [seventeen sites] of his creation are registered as World Heritage sites, across seven countries
Truly a cultural giant
Huh, I had no idea I live in a World Heritage Site (Lavaux)
I mean I guess it's nice here
Have you never seen the Unesco signs
I know there’s one when entering Lutry from Paudex, I think there’s some on the A1 too
We have two words for „butter“, on one side we have team „butter“ and on the other side team „anke“. I have no idea wether it‘s a regional thing or completely random
As a foreigner, I think scone(bone) sounds way posher
I can more readily imagine a country farmer saying scone(gone)
"Not to be Confused With Sweden"
Helvetica instead of Switzerland
No confusion with Sweden and the abbreviation CH (confoederatio helvetica) will make more sense
Plus the national personalisation, Helvetia, makes sense
I mean, our official name is "confoederatio Helvetica" as to not favour any of the 4 main languages, but I think it's best if every country just calls it what it's called in their language, so "Swiss confederation" or just "Switzerland" in English
although, you could argue that the name "Swiss" comes from only one of the founding regions so perhaps, one should call it Helvetia to generalise, but then again, Helvetia reminds of the historical Helvetic Republic, a puppet of France
Confederacy of Helvetica
Sounds A LOT cooler than Switzerland
Schweiz or Suisse/Swiss
Switzerland is long and complicated for me
Personally id change it to Swizzy as my UK mate always calls it
I'm in Spain without the S
100% this would be used differnetly outside of romania
I actually find "Realm" a more badass translation
I don't know why, maybe because it's much rarer to hear and because it sounds more fantasy
"Eastern Empire" sounds tryhard
>Türkeli
I just wanna say that that would mean a small cute Turk in swiss german and i love it
We use -li when something is small or cute
Funny how different languages can be
I think Klytaimnestra is a very cool name but nobody can pronounce that
I mean that's just a huge generalization, some people wear clothing with logos on them (Adidas, Nike, GAP, North Face, whatever), others don't.
It's not something that you could say is "typically European".
Yeah, they are around
I have a rain jacket
Wait, every french family has its own washing machine and dryer
I also found Belgian beer delicious
Then I looked at the ingredients: They add fucking sugar to their beer, of course it tastes great
Yeah, gotta come to Switzerland for the good stuff
> Are the apartments too small
Mostly yes
Even in appartment buildings
20 washing machines for 20 appartments
We have shared washing machines and dryers in the basement of most appartment buildings
Single Houses obviously have their own washing machine and dryer
I wonder if it has something to do with Saxon heritage as it's also really prevalent in Northern Germany
Never realized that sharing those is something special and I dont really see a problem with it
They are often better than what you would get for yourself and they are literally one of the cleanest thing you could share with someone
Well in some appartment buildings the tenants do have their own mashines, but if they dont a so called "washing plan" gets established
Every appartment gets minimum one time slot per week and if you want to wash outside of our your assigned hours you just have to ask your neighbours who are assigned the time slot if you can wash your clothes
You can of course wash "rogue" but it generally gets frowned upon
I am baffled how this is not standard
An apartment building with 4 washing machines and two tumblers is entirely sufficient for everyone
Well to be fair, its often not single washing machine
Its often several machines in one room
Well, so far ive only had good experiences
> but also in houses
Where would be the washing machine be for these houses
It keeps you fit at the very least
The only annoying thing is when people use it for convinience (i do that myself)
E.g. in the militairy the french speaking soldiers and the german speaking soldiers sometimes speak english with each other because their german/french is really bad
Same goes for the italian speaking soldiers
I think we shouldn't stop learning each others language just because it's easier
Well I would prefer if we had our own european lingua franca, and not american english
Germany: No
France: No
Austria: No
Liechtenstein: The fuck are they gonna do, they even borrow our military lmao
Italy: No
We're Europe's bunker
Neutral Switzerland ftw
not a personal opinion, but many Swiss conservatives are resentful towards the country respective to their language
in the German speaking part a lot of people are saying that the Germans are "invading" us and taking our jobs, in the Italian parts it's the same
I'm not as sure about the French part though
hey man something is wrong with your keyboard
fix that pls
Never forget the time we accidentaly "invaded" Liechtenstein
And we got our big, strong, skilled army
Does that make us the biggest threat to Liechtenstein ?
yees, very strong and very skilled, some smart people say it's the best army, very smart people believe me, maybe the smartest, who knows
how are they even scared of you
I can speak Romansh as my mother is from a part of Switzerland where this is spoken
I learned it as a kid
I use it sometimes when I visit relatives there, but it is not something I do regularly
Surveys by the government I have seen estimate around 35,000 speakers who use this as their main language, and another 60,000 or so that can speak it
In some towns in Switzerland, it is the official language and used in schools, government, and in every aspect of daily life, although Swiss German usually is used in parallel
Romansh is listed as a Swiss national language, and therefore has legal status and some protections
Switzerland has four national languages: German, French, Italian and Romansh
Of these, I speak German and French
I don't speak Italian but I understand some stuff when I can read it because I had to learn Classical Latin at university
I’ve only been in the Rumantsch speaking region once, but it really made me want to know more about it, and maybe even someday learn it
I think it’s  a shame it’s being kinda forgotten here in the Romandie region,
Switzerland is a subject nation under the EU, and there is nothing we could change about it
That we are an EU state in all but name
There's a constantly used expression that we are "an EU member without any say", because in most legislations (the few that are actually better than existing Swiss laws
Typically we have higher standards than the EU, with only a few "downgrades" which lead to heated debates, like the recent EU automatic gun law) we either voluntarily just follow the big market around us anyway, or are forced because of existing bilateral treaties
We are mainly not in the EU for cultural reasons rather than political considerations
They just go there and put it on the side of the road
I didn't know this is a thing
I would like to apologize on the behalf of the Swiss
I guess that happens because there is a small fee on the trash bags in most Cantons, and some unintelligent people thought they could save a few bucks
It has been reported in quite a few newspapers in Switzerland to draw attention to the unacceptable behavior of these people
Canton Geneva apparently decided to not put any fee on the bags, which made some people in France happy
Switzerland produces around \~90000000 tons of trash per year, and 10 tons of them apparently appear illegally in France, which is definitely 10 tons too much :-(.
It may seem a bit mean, but I think in Switzerland people mainly think of North Africa as cheap tourist destinations (Especially Egypt, Tunesia and Morocco) .
Not necessarily exotic, but almost always warm and sunny, with beaches and the sea etc
Not that much farther than Southern Europe but much cheaper
Edit: Typo
I learned quite a few things about the history (i. e. ancient times until the collapse of the roman empire) but I don't really know what's going on there right now
I kinda know who was colonised by who but that's about as far as it goes
I also know that everyone there speaks different dialects of Arabic and that sometimes people from regions that are far away from each other sometimes struggle when they have to communicate
I also know the names of the countries I can find there (and I think the situation in Lybia still isn't nice, there's some sort of power dispute going on there between different groups who say they're the rightful government
), so it's not a lot but luckily not just nothing
WWII so you can run around the thousands of underground bunkers and tunnels in the alps, see innocent looking chalets split open to reveal giant artillery guns, airplanes fly out of hidden underground airports
All this whilst making sure the axis powers stay out of the country
Old confederacy so (1300 onward) or the high time of swiss mercenarys (late middleage)
Arround the 14th or 15th century when Switzerland became itself and we had a strong arm, with halberds
Frontaliers
I never heard this but it's kinda funny
Like Germans are all Piefkes in Austria
Not sure about the 70's but in the 80's in the French speaking part of the country French music was popular
(Partenaire particulier, les démons de minuit, etc
) But music from the UK and USA was also very popular
**German:** Fluent, no problems
**Dutch:** When it's written down I understand about 90%. When it's spoken and I'm well-informed on the topic, I understand about 70%. I once watched a Dutch documentary about Mallorca and I was surprised by how much I was able to understand
Once I get into it, it's a bit like a distant Swiss dialect
**Swedish:** I once took some Swedish language classes for fun
I'm able to understand about 60% when it's written down
Enough to comprehend a newspaper article about a simple topic (say, a crime)
Spoken it's much more difficult
**Danish and Norwegian:** Similar to Swedish but a bit harder to understand
**Icelandic:** Don't understand anything
***Honorable mentions:***
**Old English:** I'm able to read it with the help of a dictionary
I had to learn it during my studies as an English major in university
Part of the final exam included me translating a passage from an Old English text I had never seen before
I'm now a bit rusty on the highly complex grammar though
**Middle English:** Also had to learn it in my studies
This one is much easier to understand
It's somewhere on the level of Dutch
A bit hard to get into but once I'm in there, it actually flows quite smoothly
Some writers are also easier than others
Chaucer is generally quite easy to understand and his stories are also fun to read
Although we basicly speak the same accent, Germans don't understand us very well
But this also depends on where you grew up in Switzerland
We do understand all kinds of German pretty well
As for whole different languages, it's pretty much the same for Dutch and the Scandinavian Languages
I do understand some phrases and words but mostly not a whole conversation
We understand the Germans but they don't understand us
By speaking English and a bit of German, I can grasp a few words in Dutch and Danish
As a French speaker, I picked up Spanish pretty easily while at school, dunno if French had to do with it
I pick up some words in Italian too
I suppose I could guess what a sentence in these languages means (ish)
Pretty good if its a language i never learned
And all those i did learn were very easy to learn
I watch some dutch YouTube videos every once in a while, it really depends on how fast they are speaking but usually I can pick up the key words to the conversation and can follow it more or less
Okay there we go lol
Swiss German: dialect from Zurich is my native language
I can also speak the dialect from Schaffhausen, but I rarely use it
Speaking to people with other dialects work fine, but I sometimes have to ask for clarification with certain words, but that's quite rare
Standard German: Is how we write and our language of education so I can understand and speak it
Austro-Bavarian German: I'm capable of understanding it and can even speak it to some extent but vocabulary is different sometimes
Other dialects from Germany: I generally understand them but some are kinda hard vocabulary-wise and sometimes even regarding pronunciation
Yiddish: When someone is speaking Yiddish, I sometimes understand several sentences in a row but then there are also sections where I understand barely anything
The pronunciation is quite different but that's not a problem for me, vocabulary can differ greatly (semitic and slavic influence), which is why I sometimes can't understand, the grammar is less complicated than in standard German
I can't read it because they use the Hebrew alphabet
Those were all High-Germanic-languages that came to mind, now continuing with Low-German or whatever it's called in English
English: I speak English as a second language
Scots: I can understand it (mostly) and try to use it when I need to sound angry
Jamaican Patois: Is quite difficult sometimes
AAVE (African-American vernacular English): fine
Singlish: I need to focus a bit more on the speaker but it generally works
I can even copy it to some extent
If they use loanwords I don't know I'm of course lost
Dutch/Flemish: I might understand individual words but I find it very hard to follow
Luxembourgish: same as Dutch and Flemish, maybe slightly easier
Danish: can't tell, please remove potato from mouth when speaking
Other germanic languages from Scandinavia: might understand individual words but is generally impossible to follow
Did I forget anything
Now for the romance languages
French: is my third language, that's why I'm even writing about romance languages
Italian: I might understand what you're trying to tell me if you speak slowly but I won't be able to respond
I might understand some written Italian but not a lot
My Latin is kinda helpful here though
Rätorromanisch (what's the English name for it
): depends on the local idiom, I might understand a little bit
Writing similar to Italian, Latin is also helping here
Other romance languages: little to nothing
90-95% written Schwiizerdütsch
What
Where do you find written Swiss German
r/BUENZLI or something
Kitchen related things are different here too, we have other ideas on what a "Pfanne" exactly is
To us, it's not just a frying pan
Why were they writing Swiss German when chatting with a forgeiner
Strange
Crossbow
Nah I'd say *damnatio ad bestias* ftw
Assisted suicide
Yes or fondue poisoning
My Alma Mater has a statue of William the Silent on campus
>Rutgers students affectionately call the statue "Willie the Silent" and "Still Bill
" According to student tradition, the statue is expected to whistle should a virgin happen to walk by
However, Rutgers American studies professor and folklorist Angus Kress Gillespie remarked "But over the last 200 years, he hasn't yet whistled
It is called Slutgers after all
Well we have 4 official languages (english isn’t one)
After the 5th grade you have english, french and german in school
I also talk a diffrent language at home
So basically I grew up quadrilingual (swiss german excluded)
Suprisingly not at all
But there are possibilities to do it but on the standard path there is none
At least in a place where one language has a clear majority
In the bilingual cities its normal
We have to learn at least one other language, but whe don‘t have obligatory subjects in different languages in the normal schools
we have immersive education in secondary school: the science subjects and some others (depending on the school) are taught in English instead of German
Sidenote: u/the-fim 's comment is worded a bit unclear
We don't have classes in other languages early on (normally)
Earliest I know of is English in "Gymnasium" level
You start learning English in 2nd grafe in most places
In 5th grade you'll start learning one of three languages (german, french or italian) since they are the biggest official languages
So at that point you'll have 3 languages in school (your first language, english and another official language of Switzerland depending on your location and your first language)
So e.g. me who lives in Zürich started German from the start, English in 2nd grade and French in 5th grade since it's the 2nd most popular language in Switzerland and Zürich isn't located next to an Italian-speaking area
Im general I would say this works quite well
One thing I noticed though is that the younger generations speak English a lot better than their 2nd official language and often use it to communicate with eachother over french/german
Here in Zürich I had the option to choose between English or German in the Gymnasium
for a nation that has spent most of its history at war with itself, I hear surprisingly little on separatism nowadays
Our separatists just want to be their own Canton (state) or switch Cantons
No one wants to leave Switzerland, just be included in a slightly different part of Switzerland
There are many in french, we have for example 'race' for race and breed, 'fleurir' for flourish and bloom, 'cuire' for cook and bake, 'fouet' for whip and whisk, 'plier' for fold and bend, 'aimer' for like and love
> Foot and leg are both jalka
This is so weird, it's the same in Japanese and apparently in many languages
How would you say e.g. to a doctor "I stabbed my foot" which sounds much milder than "I stabbed my leg"? If you say "I find legs sexy" do people assume you are a foot fetishist
Most Swiss identify with their town, then their canton, and then nation
I think this is a direct consequence of the history of confederation with the power distributed more regionally than with a strong central government
much more with my region which is also transnational
I identify with Switzerland the most but I also feel like I identify with Europe as a whole
Not as much as it was in history
Modern Switzerland has a central federal government with much more power than in the earlier takes on the confederation
It is pretty much a necessity in a modern world
Single currency, single foreign policy, single trade deals, standard common laws, etc
Still, even with the modern federal government, during normal times much of the power falls to the cantons
We are all Swiss; not French, German or Italian
Those are languages
Switzerland as a confederacy (in a prototypical ancient format) predates all of those modern nations
So the things that make us Swiss are older and more impactful than the language spoken
I feel more in common with a French speaking Swiss person than I do with a German national that speaks the same German language I do
Play with model railway, play games, read books, draw maps, play soccer, lego and similar stuff, played in the hay, playing with tha cats, playing with the neighbors kid
Schittliversteckis
Its some kind of hide and seek
You build small logs like a campfire
One person is the seeker the others the hiders
When seeker sees someone he has to get to his logs hand say your name and where he saw you
You now need to come out and be his prisoner
If one of the hiders manages to sneak around the seeker and kick his logs every prisoner is free again
Game ends when everyone is prisoner
hearts of hoi4
Comfortable
Very easy in French but different ways of saying it in English depending of where you come from
On the bright side, a lot of native speakers can't pronounce nuclear properly but I can haha
My trick for those words is to just drop the L. Pronounce it as "word" or "girfriend". Far easier and it sounds close enough to be unmistakable
Trust me, as an italian speaker i know that way too well
I live near the [Lavaux] a region known for it’s vineyards, by the lake Léman and the swiss and french Alps
It’s a beautiful area with a stunning view
If you’re ever visiting the region I highly recommend you go hiking there
There is a place in Switzerland called Cheese and Bread (Chäs und Brot)
Funny in (swiss)german:
Haltestelle -stop (for a bus or tram)
Dorf -Village
Wienacht - Christmas
Schwanzweid - cock meadow
Chäs und Brot - cheese and bread
Spitz - horny
Moskau - Moscow
Müllheim - trash home
Rotzloch - snot hole
Bière - beers
Brot-Dessous = bread-lingerie
Saanenmöser - creamcunter
Scherz - Joke
Affoltern - sounds like monkey torturing
Funny in english:
Prada
Dicken
Cunter
Bern Wankdorf
La Sagne
Ecce Homo
Bitsch
Horn
Only parts of towns:
End der Welt - end of the world
Altparadies - old paradise
Neuparadies - new paradise
we have a village called "Brot" which means bread and another one called "Dorf" which just means village
Titterten and Bitsch
There’s a place called Cunter in south east Switzerland, and Wankdorf near Bern where the Young Boys football team is from
There's a small town called "Bitsch"
Bitsch aka Bitch
I think we have Bitsch (Spoken out like Bitch)
Not a town or city, but my city's (Locarno) public transport company is called FART
As a teen i read Essex for the first time
Had a giggle
Porrentruy is pronounced like Boar in Sow in French , and their flag is a wild boar
Its German name is Puntrut which sounds funny too
Near me there's also Gland, which means acorn, but also means Glans (head of the penis)
And then there's a place that's just called Pigeon
And "Bitsch" in Valais
I usually get asked questions about what it is like to live in the harsh, snow covered alps
At least outside of Europe
In Europe I usually get asked about how rich I am or why my country will not just join the EU
I'm from Switzerland and live in the US
Usually it starts off with them asking me how many languages I speak and then start telling me some random story about Switzerland or Sweden (because they don't know the damn difference and Europe is apparently just one big country where everything is the same)
people usually ask me if I like chocolate but it really depends on the person, there'sn't any one big stereotype
Cheese, chocolate, watches, mountains and neutrality
Sometimes guns
Ohhh yeees i know i have been there i make you good price for good friend
Think of us like the hole in a delicious donut
We're not gonna join, just so the map will stay mildly infuriating
It defends the country from invasion
Right now they are providing medical, law enforcement and logistical support for the coronvirus thing, but in general the army practices defending the country from an invasion
I served in it back in the Cold War
We practiced ambushing tanks and infantry in the mountains and passes
Just because a nation is neutral and isn’t engaged in wars doesn’t mean it doesn’t need an army to defend itself
We are not in NATO, or other treaties, so we have to prepare to defend ourselves
Well the thing is banking isn't nearly as important as you make it seem
The financial sector, which banking is a part, is only responsible for 9
8% of GDP
Well, we are not still practicing Napoleonic war tactics
We practice one thing, defending Switzerland
The army is a modern mechanised force that trains regularly for the national responsibility of defense
As we get to choose the battlefield, and know it well, I think any modern army would find an invasion costly
The whole point of defending a tiny country with no natural resources is to make taking it so costly that it becomes a deterrent to even try
Better to stay neutral, have defensive capabilities, and do everyone's banking so they just ignore you
I suppose there is value in having combat experienced people that we lack, but I'm not sure how slugging it out in the deserts in the middle east would really improve defensive tactics in central europe
Technically, we are a third world military and nation using your country's definitions of the terms
Thing is, it never was
Banking was indeed important when banking secrecy was a thing (bigger than insurances in the financial sector) but it was not the money maker you make it seems
Financial sector was responsible for 11
1% of the GDP in 2008 when banking secrecy was ended mid-2009
We're only looking at a 12% loss for the financial sector
I think in european standards we have a big, expensive and at least average professional army
On the weekends you see many young soliders (army service is obligatory for (almost) every man) in the train with camouflage, rifles and sometimes a can of beer
I believe Switzerland keeps it’s army to NATO’s standard (without being a member of course) because surrounding countries didn’t want Switzerland in the cold war to become a weak point in Europe
Not only that, I “retired” from military service 15 years ago and I still have my rifle
Yeah it's the whole point of having an army organized as a militia
You're home but with a rifle at hand if something comes up
Also we don't only come home with the rifle the weekends: active duty is 300 days (I'll skip the details) but you're incorporated and keep in the reserve until you're between 30 and 34
During that time you have all your army belongings at home, army dress and rifle included
You can also buy your issued rifle, and/or handgun if you had one, at the end of service
100 for the SIGG550 and 30 for the P220
No snow in Geneva
Swiss/German Border (Basel) ... No real snow yet, only a few snowflakes one morning
That's it :/ If there will be snow it's always most likely at the end of February beginning of March, but tbh
The stakes are fairly low
We got a grand total of half an hour of snowing last month in Bern
It all disappeared in less than five minutes
It's pretty sad, like we don't get a ton of snow in the cities like in the mountains but at least there was snow last year
Now even a lot of ski regions have very little snow
We had a but of snow very early in November, then everything melted
December didn't see any snow, and we currently have a very tiny layer of snow, barely any
It really sucks because we used to get lots of snow throughout the winter, the local ski resort would be open the whole winter
This winter, it opened for maybe 3 weeks, around the New Year celebration
Pretty much the same in Lausanne, we had like three snowflakes one night in early december I think, but it melted right away and we had nothing since
If we're talking Europe, I'd say English, and better northern accents than southern ones
If we're talking world, then I'd say Korean
I find it smoother than Japanese, and "fuller" (if you get me)
I don't know exactly, but it's very possible, since Swiss citizenship has nothing to do with the place of birth
Well Napoleon already fits the bill
Yep, and going through the list of the hundreds of Federal Councillors we’ve had to find who was born abroad sounds really exhausting
Let’s just assume there’s been a few :’)
Our philosophy teacher told us animals can't think because they can't talk
I think there was some opposition but most students didn't care what he said anyways
Teacher of mine in the 11th grade (I worked for 4 years after the 10th grade, so I was 21 years old - meaning there's not even the reasonable assumption that I'm to young to be familiar with it) said utilitarianism is the philosophy of "reducing things to it's usefulness" which - in a very vague sense - could be right but overall is a gross misrepresentation
I was always a bit of a philosophy buff so I raised my hand and tried to elaborate
He was a nice and very knowledgeable man that really was invested in teaching us, so he'd surely appreciate it
I explained the most basic definition, even going into Bentham and Singer for it
He straight up shut me down
"It's about usefulness - it's right there in the name".
Bitch, I referenced primary sources in my definition
I think that trumps you trying to reconstruct the meaning through the name
Lost a lot of respect for that teacher that day
Ah, we had one of those German teachers, too
Everything except the most value-conserverative, Catholic or culture pessimist reading of a text was wrong
Even when it came to freaking Brecht, Dürrenmatt and Tucholsky
He was a Landtagskandidat for the AfD a couple years after I graduated
I see, so to the 2nd point is contrary to what (some) Americans get taught that they were the sole victor of ww2
But to be fair, the Americans did nothing for you in particular
~~One could even say they betrayed you (giving Stalin reign over you)~~
Edit : I'm retarded, excuse me
When you buy in just a little bit too much in that whole Sapir-Whorf theory
how
as in they took the bones, ground them up and used them as soil
I never said any of both viewpoints is correct
I wanted to give insight on why he might have said it
I never said I agree with that
I just heard that argument thrown around once (not Slovenia in that case, don't remember for which country)
And I don't think it's such a mental gymnastic
The allies wanted elections, the USSR blatantly ignored that request
I'm not blaming either side (although the communists did ignore that request) that you suffered from communism but either side could've stopped it
Yeah, it's widely celebrated, you eat Dreikönigskuchen which is a sweet bread composed of little breads and in one of them, there's a little king figure and whoever gets it is the king and gets a paper crown
Bread + crown are sold everywhere
I can't think of any
Switzerland is portrayed notoriously negatively in Hollywood movies
It's basically *evil banks, evil banks, evil banks, nazi gold, evil banks, that place where the cabal of evil shadow leaders and deep-state figureheads go to do evil seedy diplomacy and plan the New World Order, that place where some secret agent flees for 2 minutes before getting to his actual destination, more evil banks, that place where some dictator or bad guy has a secret bank account and the good guys need to close it down, that place that nobody gives a shit about
and more evil banks*.
You know funnily enough, in Bollywood Switzerland is considered a very romantic country
This is mostly due to the classic movie "Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge" or DDLJ for short
It came out in 1995 but still is playing in theaters in India to this day
Several scenes were filmed in Switzerland
[Here’s a song/scene] from it to give you an idea
I personnaly find it great, because it looks like they didn’t even try to make it look better, they just filmed it off the street like that
The grey sky, the sloppy melting snow, the people on the street looking puzzled, ... That looks more like the Switzerland I know than maybe any other movie I’ve seen
It used to be, yes
The banking secret for foreigners was abolished a few years ago due to pressure from the EU
That's not the point though
I'm not saying it's all wrong
I'm just saying those are negative stereotypes and it's not like the entire country is made up of that
It's a bit like portraying Americans as 400-kg, gun-crazy, truck driving, flag-waving hillbillies
Those guys exist but not every American is like that
It's as right or wrong as equating modern-day Germany with Nazi Germany
Yes, still far away from any realistic lifestyle tough
Especially since its a japanes series/movie
The banking secret for foreigners was abolished a few years ago
That's not the point though
It's not about whether these things are right or wrong
After all, the nazis also really existed
It's about whether these things make up an entire country; whether it's fair to say Germans = nazis or Switzerland = dictator bank accounts
My answer is a resounding no
To use another example: I'm sure there are Polish people who steal cars
However, if every single Hollywood movie portrayed Poland as a country of car thieves that would extremely unfair because the vast majority of Poles obviously don't steal cars
And germany still has Nazis in their parlament
None of you guys understands what the word "stereotype" means
I never said literally all of those things were wrong
The question is: is it fair to take all the worst parts of a country, completely blow them out of proportion and claim that this is the only thing the country is made up of
I could come up with all sorts of stereotypes about Germans and SOME Germans may fall into those stereotypes but certainly not all 80 million of them
I'm not, I'm actually pretty fucking poor
I'm disabled and dependent on social benefits
This stereotype that every Swiss is a billionaire who got rich off of other people's misery is extremely annoying
And it's unfortunate that fellow Europeans also buy into this BS
I thought only Americans were so gullible
This stereotype makes 0 sense and there is literally no proof
If there was actual proof, Switzerland would still be on all kinds of blacklists and could be sued for damages
And banking doesnt make up nearly as much of our economy as most people think
Yeah guess what Einstein, cost of living here is also far higher than in Spain
Also, I'm not touchy about the inner workings of my country, I'm touchy about the fact that you make unjustified and completely unfair generalizations
I don't know where all your hate and hostility is coming from, all I can tell you is that I'm a completely normal person, as is everyone else I know
For what it's worth, I won't assume that every Spaniard is still bemoaning the passing of Franco because I'm not a complete fucking moron
Helping people hide money and stealing money are two different things
Yes, Switzerland still has some problems with foreign tax evaders, but they arent actively stealing it
And its funny that you critisize the swiss press for beeing too discreet, while linking to an article of our public broadcaster
Yeah swissinfo is the international branch of our public broadcaster
They never post stuff in german/french/italian/romantsch but many articles get translated into our official languages or the other way around
This for example is the german version of the same article but under the banner of SRF (Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen):
What didn't he do
generally pretty neutral, altho people rave about the hotdogs and meatballs
personally I hate going there because it's always crowded with people and its pretty claustrophobic
Lol what
Germans make great WW2 jokes
In my opinion this is just a reddit thing
Ah true
Fair enough
Obviously there’s none in Switzerland, and sometimes I even forget they exist all around us
I find it weird thinking about it, I don’t like this dependance from the US, who’s a less and less stable country
Fun Fact:
US-Ambassadors aren't Diplomats
They are People who gifted the presidential campain a huge amount of money (every president, not just the current one)
They get the job as ambassador as a "thank you" for the money
The second highest officer in a embassy is the most importent one, because they are a diplomant and they have a clue what and how to do things
In most other countries, diplomats are elected by an apolitical comission or similar to that
Italian food
Also, French food
And German food, oh, Spanish food is also better in Europe than anywhere else
And Portuguese food, Greek food, Swiss food, Russian food, and so on
Except for English food, that isn't good, in Europe or anywhere else
I was partially joking, I love English roasts and fish and chips
I do love them
Argentinians couldn't agree more, haha
The source for that number in the wiki link is now dead, but when I checked it a few years back it contained "typical" UK cheeses like Camembert, Parmigiano, Brie, Gruyere, etc
So, I would take that British cheese variety with some caution, by the same metric the US could probably claim a similarly high number
edit: just checked the website in waybackmachine and I did remember correctly
Also, they don't seem to say that there are 1800 UK cheeses but 700 named cheeses produced in the UK
Of course, just wanted to point out that I don't buy that 700 number either as it contains cheeses that are typical from another country
I'm also not saying that I don't enjoy *typical* UK cheeses, I did have some good ones
Not that im aware of atleast
South american pre-colombian civilizations
They have a completely different timeline
It’s always fun to compare what happened in South america at the same time as what happenend in Europe, like at the time of Egypt, the roman empire, etc
Poland, as it has been struggling with foreign oppression for almost 200 years (1795 to 1991)
I recognize about 5 or 6 different European national anthems by melody, but not by lyrics
I only know the 1st verse of the Swiss anthem
Other anthems I recognize are Italy, Portugal, France, Germany, UK and Russia
I feel like rich people, especially the bourgeois/upper middle class type is so common here most of us don’t really pay attention to it
There’s also a lot of foreigners who come to Switzerland as a flex, I personally just laugh about it
Wealthy, yes many
But brand cloths and owning a nice car doesn't make you a showoff or rich
Not in one of the richest countries/cities on the planet
The average income in Zurich is very high
People mostly understate their wealth and often don't see themselves as rich even if they are
Zürich is a flex in itself, I wouldn't use it as an example
I'm trying to find swiss tv series, and at the moment, my answer is : It's probably Pingu
156 episodes over 10 years
I'm hoping someone will correct me, and tell me that nightmare inducing penguin isn't our national TV show
Edit : apparently a show named Lüthi und Blanc has 288 episodes over 10 years, so take that, penguin !
Still don't know if that's longest, but finding a list of swiss tv series on Google is apparently not an easy task
Pingu
It's Swiss-British produced, but made for and aired originally on Swiss TV
It later aired in UK, and a Japanese reboot came out even later
No idea where you got the South Korean from
Walliserditsch
Regardless of what the people from Wallis might tell you, they do not speak Swiss german
I'm a French speaker, and I understand people from each cantons pretty well (I just find the accent from Jura funny, but like cute funny)
But then, the Swissgermans are getting carried away
And to add to each canton having a different dialect, we have in Fribourg an old dialect called "Boltze" were they mix French and German
My grandmother speaks it, but it's starting to get less and less spoken
The only example of a word I can remember is "Schneeboula" which is a snowball, made of *Schnee* (German) and *boule* (French) + *a* (because why not)
Oh and we also have a "Patois" which may be some old variation of French they used to speak in mountains and farms, there's still some people speaking it, but mostly old people
My other gran used to speak it
As for swissgerman, I'm always wondering why I learnt German when I go to Bern, as they use French words like "Merci" and "Adieu". But so be it, oh Switzerland
vorlarlbergerisch sounds like a mix between Austrian and Swiss German
We usually get two or three days of snow per year around Zürich
And only if you go a bit higher on the hills
The Zürich itself is at the lake, which has huge heat capacity and is usually able to keep the city snow-free throughout the year
Of course we have some areas in the country that still get a metric shitton of snow every winter
I use apostrophes for thousands separators and points for decimals (e.g. 56'421
08), but I will read the decimal points as 'Komma' in German and as 'virgule' in French but as 'point' in English like everyone else
In Switzerland what I have seen is CHF 1'000'000
Never seen someone put a point on top, always apostrophes
Ah yes, the only correct way
The one and only way to write numbers
Same here, always did the 1'000 thing
It looks weird but it's very efficient and easier to differentiate than "your" version by a quick glance at bigger numbers
Mmmm I would write it 1'000'000,65
But nobody else is using it for some strange reason
Very interesting, had no idea that this wasn't a universal german language thing
I wouldn't say so to be honest
If you just take a quick look at a number it's easier to tell the difference between a " ' " and "," than "." and ",". Of course you can get used to it but it seems logical if you write one at the bottom and one on top instead of both at the bottom
~~He~~ She says while writing them backwards ;)
Edit: sorry I didn't read you name
They are the default ones in Word (annoyingly) but in school we learn to use ,, ...'' from the beginning and in papers for Uni, they are the standard as well
So I have to turn on the Deutschland German autocorrect in Word which then in turn tries to correct my ss that are ß in Germany
Never said it's a problem for anyone or you couldn't get used to it
All I'm saying is that it's easier by comparison
Both work but telling the difference between
" ' " and " , " is just even easier than
"." and "," (especially when hand-written)
of course both work when you're used to it
I think indifferent
At least that‘s my expierience
More than a quarter of the population doesn‘t belong to any religion
And from my expierience many people that belong to a religion don‘t believe in god or aren‘t sure
There are of course very religious people as well
Maybe these religious people don‘t like atheists but idk
I‘ve never had a problem saying I don‘t believe in god, when the topic comes up
I literally thought the same
Or it means bitch in French
"Oh you sad little kid
bitch"
With a sh, because most if not all sp and st sounds are pronounced with a sh in Swiss German
when speaking dialect with sh and in Standard German with s but it's not a conscious decision, it just happens for some reason
Oh you were just a second faster than me
Edit: when speaking English I pronounce it with an 's'. But in Swiss German it's definitely 'sch' /'sh'
In Swiss German too
Italian (to be able to speak it fluently), Irish for a very special lady and because I like the sound and Japanese to understand the gossip of my co-workers ;)
If only European languages are available I’d go for Rumantsch instead of Japanese
If you're at a pub to watch a big sporting match, you should at least buy a few drinks or a meal during the duration of the match
Nothing bothers me more than watching a Champions League match and seeing 5 guys taking up a table, all nursing a tea or a coke for the whole 90+ minutes
It's in poor taste, and why I'm absolutely in favor of cover charges (with credit towards drinks/food) for the big matches
All police here have pistols
In places like airports and train stations it is not unusual to see police working in two person teams, one with a pistol on their belt and the other with a submachine gun
Sometimes, under special circumstances, you might see these more heavily armed police out in the general public, like at large public events
I have no idea what kind of things riot and special swat team police use
It isn't really scary to me, as this is the norm, and the police here have never seemed particularly aggressive to me
Switzerland - police carry handguns on most occasions (except for stuff like riot control I think)
The exact model varies by Canton (~State), the most common ones being the HK P30 and the Glock 17/19
At airports I've seen them in 2-man teams with one carrying an MP5
There's a [report] on SRF (our national broadcaster) from 2016 talking about certain Cantons upgrading to semiautomatic rifles (usually something from the Sig SG55x family), but it's also mentioned that those weren't intended to be carried but instead kept ready at police stations
Intervention units have more or less everything from handguns to automatic rifles and precision rifles
we've got:
Eurasia
North America
South America
Africa
Oceania
Antarctica
North and South America are separate continents and "America" usually refers to North America or the United States, whereas South America will always be referred to as such
Australia is a both a country and a continent to us, we didn't really learn about what New Zealand belongs to
I didn't hear about Oceania until my late teens and that wasn't in school either
However, that is how I was taught \~15 years ago and the geography syllabus was recently updated, so I don't know how it's taught nowadays
Same, Oceania was often called "Australia *and* Oceania"
It depends quite a bit from city to city
In my city it's pretty good while in others there's still lots of room for improvement
Obviously it also depends who we compare ourselves with
Compared to southern Europe for example it's very good but compared to the Netherlands or Denmark, it's certainly lagging behind
To be completely fair though, some cities such as Zurich face a unique combination of challenges
For starters, Zurich is a very hilly city, which isn't the case for Amsterdam or Copenhagen
The streets are also very narrow; partially because the city wasn't destroyed during WWII, so we never had to rebuild anything
These narrow, hilly streets now somehow need to be shared by cars, trams and bicycles
in both directions of course
In most cases, that's only possible if parking lots on the side of the road are removed
However, in many cases, that is still not enough (and that's already super unpopular with conservatives)
So the next step is to remove one of the lanes and that is where it becomes super tricky
Typically, the city government doesn't want to remove tram lanes because public transport is very important for lots of people
So, that only leaves the car lanes
But what are you gonna do if you only have one lane in each direction
Make it a one-way only even if it's an important street
Abolish cars altogether
Remove the sidewalks instead and screw pedestrians
Sometimes there's just no easy solution and I actually wonder how cities in other countries solve this problem
arguably the best in the world from what i see(im not a cycler) -Switzerland
That sounds really cool
One problem we have in Switzerland regarding this is the fact that we have municipal roads and Cantonal roads
The municipal roads are within the jurisdiction of the village/town/city but the Cantonal roads are within the jurisdiction of the Canton
Some of the big streets that go through Zurich and other large cities such as Bern or Basel are Cantonal roads, which means the city doesn't have any authority over them
That's a problem because the cities are usually very lefty (both in terms of government and voter demographics) but the overall Cantons are usually quite conservative because they include a lot of rural areas
The right-wingers in the Cantonal parliament block any attempt to remove car lanes from Cantonal roads, let alone remove cars altogether
Is this also a problem in the Netherlands or do large cities such as Amsterdam have jurisdiction over all of their roads
Do the provinces get any say in it
“Si mon tonton tond ton tonton alors ton tonton sera tondu”
“If my uncle shaves your uncle than your uncle will be shaved”
And other variation:
“Ton tonton tond ton tonton”
“Your uncle shaves your uncle”
And since it’s french, obviously the “d” in “ tond” isn’t pronounced, making it a sentence with only the sound “ton”
Not my first language, but I remember learning about the passive voice in school, espacially the future tense
If I’m not mistaken there is such thing as 'werden gegessen werden' which sounds quite silly
It’s like German conjugation is so intricate you just ran out of words and had to use the same twice
And better then, when put in a subordinate sentence, you end up with something along the lines of 'weil wir gegessen werden werden' which sounds just ridiculous
(In English it would translate literally to something like ‘because we eaten will will')
Who on earth says octane
Everyone here says huitante
And we also say nonante in Switzerland
They even use it in announcements at train stations
Yep we say 'huitante'. I’ve never heard anyone anywhere in our country use the word 'octante'. I don’t know where it comes from and I’m honestly not even sure it’s a real word at all
I mean the literal translation
You could say that Switzerland follows whatever the antithesis of the cult of personality is, so this could get tricky
I think this is mainly due to the political system, because Switzerland never was ruled over by a single person, but always by a group of people
Also because of fairly low historical literacy
The single most well known (naturalized) Swiss citizen would be **Albert Einstein**, although  many people may not realize this
I still tried to make a list of people that should be reasonably well known, in no particular order and obviously not exhaustive:
* Henri Guisan
* Henry Dunant
* Henri Dufour
* Marcel Pilet-Golaz
* Ulrich Zwingli
* Ulrich Wille
* Jeremias Gotthelf
* Gottfried Keller
* Max Frisch
* Friedrich Dürrenmatt
* Paul Grüninger
* Mani Matter
If we include figures from legends and/or with questionable historical evidence as to their existence:
* Wilhelm Tell
* Arnold Winkelried
* Werner Stauffacher, Walter Fürst and Arnold von Melchtal
Theophrastus Bombast von Hohenheim aka Paracelsus is also pretty famous
The fact that you included Manni Matter makes me happy
You can add Jean-Jacques Rousseau as well as Alberto Giacometti
But you’re right about our lack of strong national figures, I don’t even know half of the people you listed
i honestly had to look up Pilet-Golaz
but if we talk about (historic) members federal council, i'd arguably add Jonas Furrer
Paul Grüninger on the other hand i'm afraid is still way too obscure - even though he absolutely should not be, i think whenever in switzerland the holocaust and the second world war is taught, people should start talking about him (and the terrible way he was treated)
But i'd also like to add some people that were not mentioned - and probably aren't well known - but in my opinion should be well known:
* Divico (granted, he predates switzerland by roughly 1300 Years)
* Gallus (technically born in ireland, but historically relevant to switzerland, also predates switzerland)
* Aegidius Tschudi
* Oskar Bider
* Anna Göldi
* Jean-Jacques Rousseau
then, historically important as whole aristocratic dynasties:
* House of Habsburg
* House of Kyburg
* House of Lenzburg
Of course you could also mention the House of Savoy, the House of Zähringen and the House of Welf - but those didn't have their family seats in (modern) swiss territories
&#x200B;
And some people i wouldn't necessarily call 'historical', but still somehwat important to swiss culture, heritage and science:
* Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi
* Carl Gustav Jung
* Johanna Spyri
* Some of the people that used to be on our Money:
* Charles-édouard Jeanneret (Le Corbusier)
* Sophie Taeuber-Arp
* Alberto Giacometti
* Leonhard Euler
* August-Henri Forel (although his history with eugenics is
yikes)
* Hermann Rorschach
* Jakob Bernoulli
* Julius Maggi
* Henri Nestle
It certainly has its perks
Thanks for adding him
Thanks for adding him
Those are all good points too
I feel like anyone we can list is somewhat niche and how many people know a given historical figure will also heavily depend on the Canton
In my list I mostly tried to go with the most well known people, though I'm viased too, so it's really a hatd task
I agree with you on Grüninger
There was however a movie about him a few years ago, which is why I included him
On which cards is willhelm tell
Tbh deadly accidents in the mountains are extremely common
Swiss German is my native language
Standard German is quite different from it, so much that I consider it a separate language
Of course I'm perfectly fluent in both but have a noticeable Swiss accent while speaking standard German though
I prefer speaking English over Standard German
I regard it as a really useful language, but I feel absolutely no passion towards it, unlike about my two native languages German and Swiss German
I just find it too inelegant
I find German extremely elegant: the spelling is phonetic except for a handful exceptions (such as "eu" being vocally rendered as "oi"); the case-based grammar allows you to construct extremely long sentences without any ambiguity about subjects/objects, and with free word order (except for the position of the verb); the language embraces the sub-sentence-ing (I really don't know how to say it in English, but in German we separate sentences much more into sub-sentences separated by commas) which allows you to bundle thoughts easier into discrete chunks without splitting them up (which can adversely affect flow); the vocabulary spirit allows you to get creative and create endless word combinations ad hoc (not just for bureaucratically condensing information, but also for humour, slang, etc
By contrast, English has **exceedingly** ugly and variable phonetic rules, the grammar is nothing special (except for the very useful past progressive), and the language loots words from all kinds of languages, which is not a bad thing in itself, but it means word combinations are much rarer and almost never combined without spaces between them, which weakens (or entirely eliminates) the association of it as a singular, dedicated concept
As programming language analogy: English is for me like C++/Javascript: functional workhorses with ugly warts
German is for me Typescript, Python or Rust: beautiful and also very useful
Swiss German would be C: a lean, mean, stripped down version of the thing you find beautiful (all the previous languages are descendants of C) that you can't really complain about and also find very elegant if you don't abuse its wacky features
My tapeworm sentences by the way highlight why I like German more, where this is less problematic
English pronunciation is so fucked up, it is definitely the worst point of the language
Another example, why are the X in 'anxiety' and 'anxious' pronounced so different
No sense, the spelling needs to be massively updated
Otherwise it is a pretty alright language, although phrasal verbs suck and prepositions also suck (e.g. why 'on the train' and not 'in the train'?, but 'in the car' is correct
), just doesn't sound as nice as others such as French, but it's not bad either
> I actually feel less weird speaking English than standard German, if that makes sense
Same
That's a sentiment very common in Switzerland
It's like standard German is in the uncanny valley of languages for us
We're soon having exams at the University
Like a few hundred people in a room
Of course there are countermeasures like proper distances between people, arriving/leaving in groups and wearing masks
I'm probably gonna get corona
I am a secondary school teacher in Geneva, Switzerland
I feel safe going back to school and as a matter of fact I strongly support re-opening it next month
It is a controlled environment as we know exactly who gets in the campus, and we got the students in the routine of regularly washing their hands and wearing their masks when in the corridors
There is some risk involved, but IMHO the benefits outweigh those risks
Among other things, I observed that during the closure of the school, the students with more problems at home lost their escape valve that is the school and their friends
All my students are also teenagers, they are eager to socialise and a significant proportion greatly suffered from the social distancing
In addition, it is too much asking to spend hours in front of a screen, that is awful enough for adults but teenagers need other forms of learning
Notwithstanding the domino effect that closing the school and sending my students home would have on their working families
Not Switzerland, but an iconic line from the former Drug Commissioner of Germany, Marlene Mortler, to the question why cannabis is illegal while alcohol isn't:
"Because cannabis is an illegal drug

Edit : this was in the context of relaxing confinement measures due to COVID-19
Jung & Naiv
Here in the french speaking part of Switzerland we’re very close to France, but not so much to other romance cultures
I don’t really feel any connection to Spain or Italy for example, and I think we’re actually more influenced by germanic culture than romance one
Even within Switzerland, we’re obviously connected by swiss culture with the two other romance languages (Italian and Romanche), but I can’t really say we have more connection with them than with the german speakers
I live in Bern and we have some very nice things
I think the best known is d'Zytglogge which is a clocktower
Then we have ds Münster, which is a church and dr Bäregrabe, thats were we kept our bears for a long time (now they have a new place right next to it called Bärepark)
The Kappelbrücke with the Wasserturm in Lucerne
In Basel, Switzerland we have many landmarks, but the most well-known is the [Basler Münster] dating from 1019
Yes, last year was its 1,000 year anniversary
(Swiss) German is just one *Hammer*, multiple *Hämmer*.
However Swiss German let's you have some fun with it:
>A: Hämmer Hämmer
>B: Hämmer
Hämmer
>A: Hammer
*: depending on the dialect it might be "Hemmer Hämmer
" and so on, as spelling is not standardized people form different regions spell things differently
Which translates to:
>A: Do we have hammers
>B: Hammers
We do have (them)
>A: Great
Swiss German words often changes the (stressed) vowel of a noun to the appropriate umlaut when it's plural
I don't know where it comes from linguistically, but it sure is a pattern:
\- *Hammer* \-> *Hämmer* (a -> ä)
\- *Hund* \-> *Hünd* (u -> ü) \[Hund = Dog\]
\- *Boda* \-> *Böda* (o -> ö) \[Boda = Floor/Ground\]
It also works the same with long vowels (which in standard German became diphthongs)
\- *Huus* \-> *Hüüser* (uu -> üü) \[Huus = House / compare with standard German *Haus* which has the *au* diphthong\]
It's even the same with diphthongs (btw
diphthongs containing umlauts are something that really separates Swiss German from standard German - German doesn't do them, except for the *äu* diphthong, and Germans can't pronounce them):
\- *Buach* \-> *Büacher* / *Büächer* (ua -> üa/üä) \[Buach = Book\]
\- *Stual* \-> *Stüal* / *Stüäl* (ua -> üa/üä) \[Stual = Chair\]
I'm not a linguists - what is an i-umlaut
In Standard German the three umlauts *ä, ö, ü* can also be written as *ae, oe, ue*, so I as a layman would have associated them with an *e* not an *i*.
In Swiss German and Standard German the *u* in *Hund* also changes to *ü* when it's female *Hündin* (still Singular)
Many female dogs wolud be *Hündina*/*Hündinä* (spelling varies) in Swiss German (*Hündinnen* in Standard German)
If I didn't smoke weed and didn't make dumb choices I could easily save ~ CHF 1'000
4'000 wage after taxes, 1'000 rent, 1'000 bills, 500 food, 500 for other stuff
Leaves 1'000
But I do pay fairly little for rent, sometimes it's a few hundred bucks more for the same size and quality
But my weed consumption costs me around 500-600 a month and with debt paybacks I can't really save that much right now
Also mind you, I have an entry level job and wage, and because I'm young get even less
People who are 30+ can easily make up to 5'500 or 6'000 for the same job
But they also have to pay more for health insurance and pension
Now the Alps are full of people and the cities are empty
Also languages will be kinda all over the place, we should get used to it, but tough day for all the transborder workers
There would suddenly be a lot of people in the alps and the flatter part of the country would be somewhat empty
Except around Zurich, all the Italian speakers from Ticino would end up there
Many people would finally have some steady good weather
In the woods just go off the path a few meters and piss behind/against a tree

You could get fined for public urination (approx $150 I think) but never happened to me
If there's an event like carnival or similar they tend to put portable toilets and those plastic urinals outside

I was also always fascinated by the concept of spelling bees, like an anthropologist
I cannot imagine a more boring mental sport if I tried
I really can't.
It strikes me as an exceedingly autistic activity (I am not using the word as a negative/insult here, just as factual description of my impression)
*Maybe* it would get interesting if you could *regularly* include linguistic principles like e.g. etymological roots, phonetic rules, etc
But they pick tricky words, so you can't go "aha, it's a Greek-sounding word starting with an "s" sound, so the probability is decent it actually starts with "ps". Bu no, instead it's just mind numbing rote learning
I really am offended by spelling bees
My interests could not be more diametrically opposed, because I love coming up with stuff on the fly (keep in mind I have ADHD) -- my preferred mental battle would be philosophy/logic debates
Think i legit read the same comic, was it a topolino or something
Idk, dictées are kind of similar
There are a lot of silent letters in French
I could imagine a French spelling bee with low-frequency words
Federal Councils are elected by the Federal Assembly, which consists of both chambers of parliament
That's a total of 246 people
It's a tad more complicated than this, though
There are a total of 7 Federal Councils
Our constitution prescribes to make the Federal Council as representative of the Swiss population as possible
Although this is a fairly broad statement, most people interpret it to mean "represent the population in a number of key aspects, such as sex, age, language
and of course political opinions". Now, the big question is: how do you squeeze 8-9 parties of various sizes into an assembly that only consists of 7 individuals
In 1954, a parliamentarian came up with a rather brilliant idea, known as the "magic formula" (Zauberformel)
It says that the three largest parties in parliament should receive 2 Federal Council members each, while the fourth largest party receives one member
Smaller parties don't get one
Although this magic formula has never been put into law, it has always been followed since its inception in the 1950s with only one notable exception in the 2000s. It's basically a "gentlemen's agreement", if you will
Based on this agreement, it is predetermined which party will get to replace a Federal Council if one of the current ones decides to retire
For example our Social Democrats currently have 2 members in the Federal Council
If one of them decides to retire, all other parties acknowledge that this seat belongs to the Social Democratic Party
They won't try to steal it
The party who gets to replace their Federal Council seat then has to produce at least one new candidate
Usually there are 2-3 candidates
These candidates are presented to the Federal Assembly
All parties then get to vote on who they want to be the new guy/girl
The party who's replacing the Federal Council seat may recommend one specific candidate but other parties don't actually need to stick to that recommendation
Parliamentarians can vote for whoever they want
Very rarely it happens that a few parliamentarians won't vote for any of the candidates and will instead write one of their own party-members on their ballot
However, while not forbidden, this behavior is considered extremely rude and it therefore happens very rarely
It's also considered politically unwise because if you try to screw over other parties when they are vulnerable, you can be pretty sure they'll do the same to you once you have to replace your own Federal Council seat
There's a very important term called [**consociationalism**] which is a cornerstone of Swiss politics and Swiss culture
In essence, it means that in a country that is very much divided along cultural, ethnic, linguistic etc
lines such as Switzerland, power-sharing is extremely important
Contrary to the US for example where politics are very dirty, Swiss politics are very conciliatory
Everyone understands that in order to keep the country together, it's important to involve as many people in the political process as possible and to represent as many people as possible
This is why all parties in Swiss politics support their opponents' claim to power
It's a peaceful way of creating a functioning society, government and leadership while avoiding serious divisions, disenfranchisement or violence
Every post I see on this sub where I think: Uh I can answer that our system is quite interesting and unique theres a post from you thats like a fucking school presentation with every little detail
How do you do it
Due to this system, there is virtually no opposition
The closest thing we have to that is SVP, the biggest party in Switzerland, our national conservative party
They sometimes act like an opposition and block stuff but it's not that extreme
Also, being the biggest party doesn't really help them because all the others don't agree with them on most issues
There's some pressure from my partner's parents asking when we want kids
I always tell them the moment they agree to look after my kids too or are ready to co-finance such an endeavour
Kids are bloody expensive
I dont really think so, but that might just be my family
Hope others can maybe say a bit more
**Appenzell:** Pretty much the Alabama of Switzerland, lots of "patriot" people and it often is mocked about how only incest people live there
**Zürich:** Arrogant people, basically the "real" capital of Switzerland
**Luzern:** China: Part 2
**Bern:** They move and talk very sloooowly
**Thurgau:** Apples, apples, apples, apples, apples and even more apples
Also home of the ugliest dialect in Switzerland
**Jura:** Doesn't exist (Jura is the newest canton and is often forgotten)
**Aargau:** Worst drivers in the country, their numberplate "AG" apparently stands for "Achtung Gefahr
" (German for: Watch out, danger
In Switzerland we only have stereotypes for the people who speak the same language
German speaking
Zürich: arrogant (no we're not, you're just jealous)
Bern: slow (they really speak slowly and it sometimes seems like they even walk more slowly)
Basel: I don't know, I just know that Zurich and Basel hate each other
Maybe you could make fun of their dialect
Thurgau: their dialect, rural people live their I guess
Schaffhausen: their dialect
Gallen: their dialect (all these three are kinda similar)
Appenzell Ausserrhoden: not much
Appenzell Innerrhoden: very conservative, like Alabama but without the pro-life (at least I think so)
Graubünden: not much (is very complicated and somewhat diverse, Graubünden is like a smaller version of Switzerland inside Switzerland)
Aargau: province, enemy of Zurich
Wallis/Valais: conservative, nobody can understand them
Uri, Schwyz, Obwalden, Nidwalden: conservative, where Switzerland began in 1291
Luzern: I don't know
Zug: I don't know, really small
Is there anything else
French speaking
Valais/Wallis: nobody can understand them (yes, the French speaking half of this canton has the same stereotype as the German part)
Jura: funny accent, Jura libre since independence from Bern, nationalists
No idea about the rest
In Graubünden, they call the Surselva (one valley there) a 3rd world place
In another valley, Engadin (originally only in the lower part, the others were added later), they have a stereotype/nickname for every single village
The first stereotype about Moldova here is that it's part of Romania
Why do most countries have a place with sheep shaggers
Do we have one
The clichés I hear about some cantons are:
**Geneva**: arrogant complainers and pretentious big mouths (sometimes called "grandes gueules" in French)
**Vaud**: sluggish and jovial simpletons who are always up for some beer at the bistrot
**Jura**: irresponsable yet jolly party animals and roadhogs
**Neuchâtel**: refined, cunning and sophisticated (come to think of it, I haven't heard a lot of pejorative stereotypes surrounding them)
**Valais**: drunkards, Subaru Impreza drivers and wolf hunters - there's also a lot of incestuous jokes around them as well
**Fribourg**: unhygienic and lazy (at least when it comes to the stereotypes surrounding the French speaking part)
Wallis:  is Kinda alabama too for the incest part but they aren't as mutch patriotic as Appenzell
But they are mountain cavemen tho
Nice seeing the french speaking part got some funny cliches too haha
Coming from Valais, I can say you're right, even though I must say we are the best at drunk-driving
they also speak the language of the gods
Lucerne is always filled with massive amounts of Chinese tourists, especially on the Kapellbrücke (famous bridge over the Reuss in Lucerne)
>and Zug are full of rich foreigners who stroke tax deals (as in Pauschalbesteuerung)
Not sure if anyone actually comes from here
I do :(
Hahahahahahaha
Never thought of that one, but I don't think that any canton has that stereotype
I know right
But Fribourg is kindof better for this
Yeah that might be a slight issue
The French border is 500 meters from my house
The German border is about 2 km down the road
I can see both countries out my window right now
It opens up some cool shopping opportunities and one can listen to diverse news sources quite easily
Before coronavirus restrictions came to be I would travel to both countries at least once a week
The border is only noticeable by the presence of Swiss zoll customs stations and the occasional border police inspecting people for undeclared goods
if you live next to the border the other side doesn't feel like a different country but more like extended home, in fact more so than most of your own country
All the time, I often go France (less now because of corona) just to go shopping because it’s so much cheaper
The prices in Ticino are the same, but Swiss Germans love to make holiday-trips there
Some people just go there for a week-end or a day trip
Maybe the parking lots of shopping centres are the only ones available
And don't forget Swiss Einkaufstourismus
I really miss Edeka
I have a government issued assault rifle in my home
I think that is a rather uncommon thing
Aromat
I am currently in the army and at all times i carry a small can of it with me
(It‘s a spice, more or less)
And, to make everybody even more confused: The assault rifles are fully auto until you leave military service
This includes being in the reserves for sometimes over 10 years
So basically there are many people here who got a full auto assault rifle for free and the government is just like "come back in 10 years and let me convert it to semi auto later".
And of course you get the gun along with free training during service
And 2 yearly free shooting events if you want to
Oh and you want a pistol as well
Just need proof that you're trained on that model and to get a background check (if you left the service already) and you can rent it for free in addition
But if you want to get the real picture: after the service you put the rifle in the wardrobe, take it out once a year for the shooting event if you have to and after you just forget that you even have it
If you're not part of a shooting club doing it as a sport at least
And no, you can not carry a gun here
There are more suicides by gun in comparison to other countries, however homicides using guns are rather rare
It's actually pretty common here as well
All the italian immigrants in the last century brought that with them it seems
You can find it in many households and it seems to be very popular among students and hikers
However, it's often referred to using a derogatory word for those italians
Well the italian one is just superior
Of course ours is still the best but italy gets close second ;)
And fuck schuko, why does it have to be this fucking big
Usually you mostly see kids/teenagers in more rural areas having those here
Not in cities really
For sdults it's usually just some reflective seam on jackets or backpacks
But not mandatory at all
Think it's quite common here as well however mostly among those that like cooking
Don't really need it for shitty pasta ;)
It has a Swiss shield emblem on the top of the receiver
Sadly no corkscrew or beer opener on it
If you want to show other swiss people how swiss you are, you use aromat
No idea
Damn I didn't know for all this time
That's kinda cool
Or use our trusty Swiss Army Knife before
Free health care for all, allegedly quite wide-spread in the EU
I really like to badmouth the USA at every occasion, but the east- and westcoast and especially Canada are so far ahead of us on this
It's sad
>We’ve got mandatory health insurance of about \~€110 a month
In addition: the first €385 of health care costs are for yourself each year (if you need healthcare that is)
Trust me when I say: this is extraordinarily cheap when compared to Swiss premiums
Fast
Not immediate, if you are on a mandatory insurance plan only
However, no Dr House episodes here
Immediate, if you are in a private insurance plan
Because otherwise, you wouldn't subscribe
Well, it leaves one with streets that are not accessible to cars, and creates logistical issues with parking, construction, utilities and such
We put a lot of that stuff underground beneath the old city
I think it makes for a nice, walkable city with lots of pedestrian areas
Driveable roads and space for trams and public transport surround the old city, so one can readily reach any part of it very easily with a short walk of a few minutes time
The oldest thing where I live is a small ruined fort built by the Celts in the first century BC
It was trashed by the Romans in 58 BC when they took over the region
Most of the old city dates from around 1356 or newer because a large earthquake in 1356 destroyed the older stuff, with a few notable exceptions (a cathedral, etc
Well in Switzerland we have the beautiful saying "alles ussert dSVP" or "everything but the Swiss Peoples Party", so yes, strategic voting definitly happens
but you have more than enough alternatives to choose from
ive never come to the situation where i voted for someone just for the sake of him/her not being SVP
idk, maybe it happens in the smaller cantons with fewer candidates
but in the big cantons you usually just vote for who ever represents you the best
If we had a voting and election system like the US, the polarisation would really become apparent
The biggest parties are both really far away from each other
With our system it is relativly easy to avoid voting for the SVP because of the many choices we have
But just imagine if we didn't. The SVP would dominate everything
Well in general elections, definitly
There are elections tough where you can still apply it
City council, justice election etc
often dont have enough alternatives that represent you and I definitly apply "Everything but SVP" when it comes to a head on head
Yeah, i should have definitly clarified
The name itself could easily be a name of a left leaning party or a more moderate conservative party, but they are just another populist right wing party
I would rather not imagine but yes, we can be happy that we have the political system that we currently have since its somewhat "unfair" to stronger parties since we have things like the Zauberformel or other checks and balances that allow a bigger diversity in our political landscape
While I hate the SVP, im glad that they are the furthest right party with relevance and not as bad as the AFD
Imagine the right wing of the CSU, thats probably the closest you get
You could describe them as "farmer-conservative" without any ambitions outside of our borders
The AfD is a pure "anti-system" demagogery party, but the SVP is a  "normal" party that, for the past 20 years selectively puts on an 'provocative opposition party' marketing whenever the people running it think it's going to suit them
It still has a fairly large population of voters who were there before Christoph Blocher took over, and are classic right-wing conservatives without being populists, by they tend to shut up as long as the populist rhetoric wins in the ballot boxes
And those running the party aren't incompetent or stupid by any means, but they are very twisted
I personally have only experienced this once before
There were three candidates SP, FDP and SVP, whereby the SP candidate had no chance and the SVP candidate was a big idiot
So I had to vote for the FDP candidate, although I would have preferred the SP candidate
Regarding the "Zauberformel": Do you think the SP and/or FDP will ever have to give one of their seats to the Greens and/or the GLP
Well, Switzerland is an Island in the middle of the EU
Since our economy heavily relies on trade with the EU, we need a so called bilateral accord, an agreement that regulates trade, research and everything else between Switzerland and the EU
While every party agrees that we need a bilateral accord, the way the accord should look and how it should be negotiated are highly controversial
While most parties have somewhat realistic expectations, the SVP is a bit overconfident
They basically think that we are more important to the EU than the EU is to us and therefore we should be the ones to make demands, which is, of course, fucking bullshit
They also threatend that they would rather have no deal than a "bad deal" which would destroy our insanly high level of quality of life in just a few years
You can compare it to the Brexit negotiations to some extent
Switzerland is neither in the EU nor in the EEA
That means we have to have our own bilateral treaties with the EU instead of an automated one in the EEA
Right now there are negotiations between Switzerland and the EU about a new bilateral treaty which would simplify our realtions
The SVP is completly against this because "EU bad" and "sovereignty". The other parties are also reluctant to sign this treaty because of specific things in the treaty, but in the end probably have to sign it, to not wreck our economy
Well, if we are beeing honest the next party that would have to give up a seat would be the CVP or the FDP but I think that will only be possible if the GLP and the GPS can confirm their results of 2019 in the next election
If that is the case, their best bet would be to find a candidate that fits both the GPS and the GLP and attack one of the FDP seats with their new found strength
It might have been possible last year aswell, but the GPS just assumed that the GLP would support every GPS candidate instead of the FDP alternative, which was just foolish thing to assume
I think the biggest difference lies in the genesis of these two parties
The SVP was founded with the merger of several different parties in the 1970s. One of the main members was the BGB, which stood up for the needs of farmers and simple workers
For a long time (partly still today) the SVP was seen as the party that should stand up for the needs of precisely these people
In fact, this has not really been the case for a long time
The SVP is basically an economically liberal (if there are economic advantages) but culturally conservative party
In my opinion this has nothing to do with farmers and workers, but with rich and tendentiously racist people
Some of the main contents of the party programs of the AfD and the SVP are congruent, but the history and the reasons behind it are partly different
Nevertheless, according to studies, the SVP is the 'most right-wing' party in Europe
So even more conservative than the AfD
In addition, the SVP tends to be a bit more serious, probably because they 'represent' a large part of the people - in contrast to the AfD
But they too sometimes like dishonest and, above all, populist methods
It's impossible to not mention how there was a pre-Blocher SVP, and a Blocher era SVP
Before Blocher took over, there was the Bernese and the Zürich wing - the first being rural conservative moderate right-wing pro-farmers, the second being the rich industrial capitalists looking to push their interests
Blocher was the leader of the Zürcher wing, and by inundating the party with his personal wealth, *de-facto* took over the entire party
We've been having this discussion for years and the SVP still believes in it
They even threatend to close the Gotthard Basistunnel (google it, its just a long train tunnel through the Alps) since apparently they think that there is no other way to transport goods from the northern europe to italy and the EU would definitly cave in if we did so
The only really pro-EU party in Switzerland is the SP (they even had/have "joining the EU" in their party program, but they see a problem in the worker's right's if the EU treaty gets accepted
I would not consider the greens a pro-EU party but they often share their viewpoints with the SP
The greens and the SP are nearly the same party, except the different focus (SP focuses on social aspects and the greens on ecological)
The SP is more of a governing party than the greens and thus they are more important when it comes to their viewpoint on foreign policy
Of course we are dependent on trade with the EU, especially food, but trying to rationalize with right wing populist is a lost cause
Well due to our political system they will never be the only party in control of the government and theyve lost some imporant elections in the last few years, so im hopeful
Well, it seems that the oppression of women is slolwly disappearing
It depens on the person I guess
We’re usually known among our neighbors for being quite slow, but people who live in the mountains and know those narrow snake-like roads by heart will go pretty fast
If you’re not used to it it’s quite scary as the passenger
lol i have a TT and im scared to drive it in most places in Italy ,to narrow for even that little car
We mostly avoid this problem here by giving up on cars and riding trains
Franzl Lang - Mei Vata is a Appenzeller is what people think what Swiss music is but idk which song describes Switzerland
RIP Franzl Lang
Maybe also jd BoBo I don't know
I don't know where the name comes from but there's a town named Thun and the lake next to it is called lake Thun but not a single Thuna lives in the lake nor the river flowing from the lake through the town
The bavarian language is less and less common amongst each younger generation
Large cities like Nürnberg and Munich are already almost completely high-german-speaking
You see this in other european regions like Brittany in France, where almost noone speaks Breton anymore or the Raetoroman part of Switzerland
It’s different in Switzerland, where dialects are a huge part of your identity
The Swiss German dialects are also not associated to rural vs urban environnements
We're both in home office these days
We are getting up quite early, but besides coffee/tea there's no breakfast
At around 11:00 we sometimes have some small lunch, typically a salad of some sort
But at 17:00 we stop working and concentrate on ourselves
A lot of time is regularly spent in the kitchen while cooking a real dinner (e.g. [Gnocchi from scratch] just the other day), during which sometimes a glass of Prosecco is consumed
These are the most relaxing hours of the day
Can recommend
I think this is a matter of self-organisation, not one of modern society in itself
I work full-time, and still have a lot of free time
We also have them in Zurich on one footbridge across the river (for some reason all of them are there) and it looks really ugly and it's polluting the environment too
Yeah I've been doing that for the last 3 years
But with interruptions when you're sick or on vacation and so on
So far it's been great
Yeah that's sad
I'm quite lucky as there are many different ones here but I tend to go to the same every time
Lugano (all of Ticino really)
Italian speaking
Almost Mediterranean climate
I also feel like I’m in a different country in Geneva sometimes
The rest of the Romandie feels Swiss even with the different language, but for some reason Geneva feels extremely French to me
But Ticino definitely feels totally different
Climate, scenery, architecture, language, food, everything feels different
But coming back to Ticino from Italy makes me feels at home, so it doesn’t quite feel Italian to me
Coming from the canton of Vaud, we always take the piss at Geneva by calling it France, and I can’t say it’s unfounded
However people of Geneva don’t like being called french and will be angry at you if you do
Must be the margherita
I'll accept being called French if you can accept that Vaud are mostly British expats that don't speak a lick of French
Just a normal sized one
30cm or similar, just the standard size
While 20CHF for a pizza is a reasonable price in a restaurant, 18CHF for a kebab is a scam, or did you get it with extra gold in it ? All the ones I know are 8-10CHF
Welcome to Switzerland indeed
Friend came to visit me from the U.S.
I was late picking him up so he decided to get himself a coffee while waiting
(his story)
I gave the cashier a 20
She gave me back 3 coins
What the fuck man
If it was a menu then yeah sorry that’s a normal price :’) If you ever come back to Switzerland, I advise you to just always carry your own water bottle, you’ll save quite a few bucks very quickly
If this many dialects alredy fit within ~41'000km^2 then I don't dare imagine how much it would change even two countries over
I don't even speak it but I vote for Rumantsch because it's pretty cool and I can understand some parts of it
I would choose a gone language we fictionally share(d) on the continet: Valyrian
Plus: Swiss German doesn't really have rules
And only 2 time forms
Pretty simple stuff
Con: no rules
Meanwhile here it's sometimes pretty hard to understand someone that's living 150km away in some valley
I think Swiss German variations can be way more extreme than English ones are
For example some local variants even switch around the word order in a sentence which, while you get used to that, throws you off a bit if you aren't.
But then again you have regions where variations are very slim and it might as well be the same
Oh yes I definitely agree
The same can be seen in some traditions that are contained to some small areas/remote parts
And rumantsch, which is a completely different but small language, is spoken in some remote vallies is eastern Switzerland and has very different writing/speaking forms for each one of those
Sorry the writing system is a bit shitty worded from my side
Yes it's also using the Latin alphabet
The difference is more like two different languages, same alphabet but very different pronunciation/words
There are 5 mayor variants of it and some really can not communicate with each other at all
Rumantsch is not really related to German but stems from Latin/Italian if I remember correctly
It does sound somewhat similar to Italian but destinctly different, so even as a non speaker I can distinguish those two
Rumantsch is actually one of the 4 official Languages here in Switzerland
There's an official TV channel, and all other government stuff could be requested in this language
Practically though almost all of those native speakers are completely bilingual with either (Swiss) German or Italian though so it's more of a let's keep it alive than a necessity
There are only roughly 50k native speakers, however I don't think it's dying out
Maybe what we did to our own children
Verdingkinder who were nothing more than slaves
Or taking the jews gold from Hitler
But that is more a mistake of the banks
Recently, voting to close our nuclear plants
We'll regret it later
Uhm
I don't know
But I might be able to tell you in a year or something, depending on how we negotiate with the EU
Too hot starts at 27° C here for me, I might feel different in other parts of the world though, for example 30° C in Athens isn't like 30° C in Zurich because of different levels of humidity and wind
For the rest check out the list by u/HSDev18
Sleep late and sleep as soon as I get home even though I'm taking Vitamin D3 tablets
Basically hibernate until spring unless there's a reason to go outside
Wtf I would kill myself
Yeah
Lovely
Probably not too infrequented but I was in Greece a few years ago and when we were in a restaurant in Athens I used the bit of modern Greek I had learned before the trip (I was learning ancient Greek in school back then) and the waiters were somewhat impressed and it made them very happy and they gave us some extra food
Edit: oh and back home at the Christmas market there was gyros stand and I ordered in my broken Greek which confused the guy but I then explained the ancient Greek thing
Yeah same but I've met like zero Welsh people
Okay thank you for explaining how 'whom' works, I needed that
Yeah I know, but I feel like I should know how to use it with the amount of English I learned in school over the years, especially since I text in English with one of my former classmates and she seems to use it correctly so I should know too I guess
How about some direct democracy ?
Switzerland can provide the punctuality that is needed here
That's actually a pretty funny name
In German we usually just use the English idea --> [Helikopter-Eltern]
I'm not sure if there even is a special word for the kids of Helikopter-Eltern
I usually just call them a "verzogener/verwöhnter Fratz" which would translate to "spoiled brat".
Glucke for the mother, too
As in „Motherhen“.
I usually just call the children "Einzelchinder" ;)
I live near the Matterhorn and until two years ago I never went
It was actually pretty nice
Fresh air, cooler temperatures, not that much tourists (which was surprising)
You start counting at 21
Ein-und-zwan-zig, Zwei-und-zwan-zig, Drei-und-zwan-zig etc
(21, 22, 23 ...)
I was about to reply that we do the same here until I noticed we're both from Switzerland lol
Yes, in German, two-digit numbers are said "backwards", in Dutch it's the same I believe
So for example 72 is "zweiundsiebzig" (two-and-seventy)
I can work best when it's around 15-20 degrees Celsius
anything above 25 and I start getting tired
sorry
I would recommend to choose whatever you're talented at and passionate about
Luckily, we don't have the kind of situation in Switzerland where the country is overflowing with academic degrees like in the US and some EU nations
This is due to our unique education system and the exclusive status of university education
Contrary to America, only a small percentage of students (15%-20%) make it to university because you need very good grades
When I go online, I often see people deride the social sciences and especially the humanities
However, in real life I make very different experiences
Most of my best friends, my wife, my brother and myself have all degrees in the humanities and we're all doing fine
None of us is struggling to find a job specifically due to the fields we've studied
In fact, sometimes humanities degrees can get you pretty far here
For example a lot of people want to become a high school teacher
The education is considerably longer and more challenging than in America (it takes about 7-8 years of study) but the pay is very good
Some people also end up in private companies and do very well there
For example I know a woman my age who studied philosophy and now she's a career-climber in a big insurance corp
That isn't to say that technical or natural science fields are bad in any way
I encourage anyone who is into that to follow their dream
Contrary to the STEM-people who love to hate on the humanities, most humanities people like myself actually have a very favorable opinion of other fields
For example I would have loved to study medicine but I'm blind, so that wasn't an option
So yeah, if I had children, I would tell them to follow their passions and talents
This is also true by the way if they were among the 80%-85% of teenagers who don't attend high school and later university
Society claims there are some apprenticeships that are more "worthy" or "valuable" than others
For example becoming an electrician is supposedly better than a car mechanic or a cook
But you know what
If cars or cooking are your passion and you're genuinely good at this stuff, you should choose that path
There are a lot of people who tell others to choose a job/field (such as STEM) even if they are completely uninterested and untalented at it and I find that beyond idiotic
Like, what's the point of wasting many years of your life to get a Masters in engineering if you don't give a shit about it and you suck at math
It makes no sense
What a healthy society needs, above all else, are people who are happy with their lives and enjoy what they do for a living
Apparently we do have humour
It's probably somewhat due to the fact that no matter the job, if you make minimum wage (which isn't clearly defined but usually around 3-4k/month) then you can leave a ok life
Nothing fancy but you get by without debt, a second job or awful hours
So yeah, in the end it's delusional to say it doesn't matter
But he kinda has a point as just cause you're a cashier or server you're not gonna starve
You have bohemian dumplings and therefore won
Svíčková is so good omg
If you plan to go international then yeah you have a point
Just as getting a swiss police education or swiss law degree isn't that useful outside Switzerland
But luckily here we have more equality between STEM and humanistic degrees, at least if you compare it to some other places
It's still not perfect here of course but that's probably a given
(Even in time of crisis/war you need new buildings, roads and IT
Not so much art and gender studies
Because one is necessary to survive and the other isn't. But why should we only barely survive and not live well and comfortable when we can afford it
How much we want to/can afford it dictates how equal those studies will be)
[Rivella]  is a Swiss soft drink made from milk whey
i think it‘s available in some parts of neighbouring countries as well (close to the border) but i‘ve never seen it anywhere else
16-year olds can afford intercontinental travel out of their own pocket
Hey, that's illegal
(/s)
I feel exactly the same way about this
This probably means that I'll have to move to Sweden
In German, it's not as bad as in English but still not great
Personally, I often use the unchanged names
Dude we have good bread too
I have to admit you're right
same here in switzerland except we call it z’vieri
iirc the Rivella in the Netherlands are brands we didn't like but the Dutch for some reason did
May not be true, heard it from my teacher once
It's less the bread itself and more the ability to, every morning, go buy cheap but warm and excellent bread at the bakery that's around the corner
In every other country I've stayed in there is either no local bakery, or the bread is not as tasty or too expensive
It's still cocoa, just only the butter
So I'd still call it chocolate personally
Kim Jong Un went to school here as well
Rockets are flying because he is out of Emmental cheese again probably
Yeah but we professionalized this stuff and it wasn't just with the Nazis
We were (and to some degree still are) the masters of authoritarian money and education from all over
Because if there is one thing you can do in this country it's being rich and keep to yourself
Be Kim Jong's son and you go to school here and nobody knows
Russian oligarch fresh out of jail
I saw that dude casually on the train mate, nobody gave a shit
Uhm, which atrocities did switzerland commit
I don't argue that we were super clean but atrocities
We after some time took no more jewish refugees but it was not like we took none, is that an atrocity
Maybe, but not in the context of the time
> the masters of education from all over
Could you name a few
I only know that Kim Jong-un went to school here for 2 years in his teens
Barbarian
Same goes for Switzerland
Some dude said we shouldn't have been neutral
Definitely when we were surrounded by the axis after 1941
It's a fact
> Switzerland explicitly enabled the financial and logistic aspects of the Holocaust
Do i understand this right
IBM (American Company) sold the nazis technologies and went trough Switzerland for it
Are orange Fiskars scissors from Finland a thing in your country
These [amazing little scissors] were a staple in my family's household since I can remember
Even though this particular kind is apparently intended for fine needlework, we mostly used them as medical scissors, for wound care and stuff
The first aid kit always had one in them, and dad got really mad if you took them without putting them back
Same with mom, who had a second pair for actual needle work
The third pair I luckily got to take with me back when I moved out, but unfortunately I lost it a while ago
Only when my mom (reluctantly) sent me her pair to replace them, did I actually notice the brand name, and that it's a Finnish product
These must be well beyond 20 years old by now, and are still just as sharp as ever
Before that I tried my luck in a pharmacy, assuming they must have them and know what I'm talking about:
* "Could I get a pair of those small, sharp precision scissors for wound care
You know, the tiny orange ones
* <blank stare>
* "No
* "These are the only ones we got"
* <hands me a pair of lousy, dull scissors with rounded tips>
So I guess reactions could go either way: Either everyone knows what I'm talking about, and cherishes them as well, or everyone's wondering why someone can get this excited about a pair of  scissors
*Edit: Wow, thanks to everyone who responded
I had a feeling these could be popular, but didn't quite expect so many reactions :)*
We have a pair of large red ones in my home, I’d never realised they were something particular
Oh wow, that's interesting
When googling for this vote, this turned up:[Deconstructing Product Design: Exploring the Form, Function, Usability, Sustainability, and Commercial Success of 100 Amazing Products]
>Bäckström sent orders for the first plastic prototypes to be produced in black, red and green
The plastic works was finishing a production run of Fiskars popular plastic orange juicer, and residual material had been left in the machine
Rather than let it go to waste, the **frugal operator decided to use the remaining orange plastic to create prototypes in an unrequested fourth color**. The prototypes were delivered, and the scissors with the black and orange handles were deemed the favourites
Fiskars then decided to take an internal vote to make a final decision between black and orange, and the prototype with the orange handles prevailed
So that iconic orange color is basically a happy accident - neat :)
>I love them a lot, I use them for everything
Right
If you need a dependable pair of scissors for some fine stuff, these are the ones for the job
I never realized how much I appreciated them until I lost mine
These days I'm using mine to carefully snip off early flower buds off my chili peppers without harming any of the tiny leaves close by :)
I... was an active kid
There was a need for some dedicated medical hardware in our household ;-)
For me it was the other way round - I had no idea they're from a company that also makes axes and gardening gear
But would certainly buy from them if I happen to come across it
That's the thing, I don't think I've consciously noticed this brand in Switzerland even once
But now that I know what they're called, they seem to be readily available
Ok, that is quite unsettling :)
And "clothing and accessory collection designed for gardening and urban exploring", plus "jacket with stab-proof pockets".
What's their target audience
Serial killers on the run, with a knack for gardening
>They still make razor blades/shaving stuff
That's what they're known for here
Not that I have shaved in the last three months
*noises of angry Swiss people with sticks*
I don’t know them here, but I live in the french speaking side
Maybe it’s more popular in regions closer to the border with Austria ?
We are famous for apricots in my region but I don't remember something like dumplings
McDonald's is the only thing open that late
Maybe a kebab
Edit: most bars I know sell grilled cheese sandwich or stuff like that
Usually every restaurant and other food seller is closed at this time, except some Mcdonald’s, so that’s pretty much the only option if you want to eat out
I do not think that such a building exists
What comes closest to the uniqueness of an Eiffel Tower or Statue of Liberty is probably the [weather station on the Jungfraujoch] or the [Kapellbrücke in Luzern]
Swiss are not the right people for expensive, big prestige-buildings
But I find the parliament in Bern mentionworthy: not only the outside, but also the inside, the water fountain in front of it and the idea it stands for
I concur with others, I think the jet d'eau is more iconic, perhaps the Château de Chillon too
I'm very sorry about that
Noo the roche towers (there's two now) are neat
Also now Zurich doesn't have the highest building anymore, so suck it Zurich
I have a friend with a very good and expensive bike and he put black tape on it to hide the brand and give it a shabby look and it works extremely well
This is by far the dumbest shit ive read in awhile
Tell me if I'm mistaken, but I'd say since 1815
It's actually the real beginning of Switzerland, then some cantons changed a bit
The Sonderbund war was a civil one, so no other country pressure there

If you'd go to a "better" bar, you would get the same reaction
All bars I'm used to go would be glad that you're here as every money is money and the people are there for having good times and a drink together
And it's to be said, that the shot prices don't really vary in the city I live
In most places a shot is 5 Swiss Francs
For some reason we were thaught about the eskimos for almost a year in elementary school
Then about the germanic tribes and medieval switzerland
In 7-9 grade we stopped learning about ancient subjects because we look into the french revolution, ww1, weimarer republik, ww2 and the cold war
It's hard to answer this question, because i believe that every single country has something worth seeing to offer

I wonder how many Americans think that Europe is still stuck in medieval times
this is the funniest one
Yeah just recently I found a thread on reddit talking about Swedish gun laws
Turns out they meant Swiss
tbf I meet a lot of Europeans that have a similar attitude towards South America/Asia
I dont remember the details of the conversation but the shocking part is that they didn‘t really know what Mohammed was
Meanwhile the French insist you greet them in their local language even if you don't speak French

These are the relevant articles about self-defense and defense of others from the Swiss Penal Code:
>[**Legitimate self-defence**]
>[Art
15]
>If any person is unlawfully attacked or threatened with imminent attack, the person attacked and any other person are entitled to ward off the attack by means that are reasonable in the circumstances
>[**Mitigatory self-defence**]
>[Art
16]
>1 If a person in defending himself exceeds the limits of self-defence as defined in Article 15 and in doing so commits an offence, the court shall reduce the sentence
>2 If a person in defending himself exceeds the limits of self-defence as a result of excusable excitement or panic in reaction to the attack, he does not commit an offence
>[**Legitimate act in a situation of necessity**]
>[Art
17]
>Any person who carries out an act that carries a criminal penalty in order to save a legal interest of his own or of another from immediate and not otherwise avertable danger, acts lawfully if by doing so he safeguards interests of higher value
>[**Mitigatory act in a situation of necessity**]
>[Art
18]
>1 Any person who carries out an act that carries a criminal penalty in order to save himself or another from immediate and not otherwise avertable danger to life or limb, freedom, honour, property or other interests of high value shall receive a reduced penalty if he could reasonably have been expected to abandon the endangered interest
>2 If the person concerned could not have been reasonably expected to abandon the endangered interest, he does not commit an offence
Basically you can use whatever means you deem necessary to defend yourself, be it a gun or a knife for instance, and you will either be completely fine or get a reduced sentence for going too far in the eyes of the judge as it is all about *reasonable means
* An old lady blasting a big scary guy with a shotgun would be fine versus the opposite
However as carry licenses are almost impossible to get, if you're being attacked outside of your home you won't have a gun to return the courtesy
You can still have pepper spray or knives on you though, and it's perfectly legal to have a loaded gun at home
Each Canton (=federal subdivision of Switzerland) has it's own Police force (Kantonspolizei), big cities may have an additional Police (Stadtpolizei)
There's also a federal police (fedpol), but as far as I understood they mostly just coordinate between the various cantonal police forces whenever that's necessary
Uniforms, cars, equipment etc
therefore all varies from Canton to Canton
There is also military police, but they are a branch of the armed forces and don't interact with the civilian population (their job is to guard bases, escort ammunition transports, and investigate crime within the military)
They also don't wear police style uniforms but military style uniforms
It's very rare to see military police (unless during military service)
To add another thing to the confusion: some rural areas have a joined police force as well
It's on the same hierarchy level as the city police (stadtpolizei) but over a region thus called the regional police (regionalpolizei)
And some bigger cities don't have a city police but rather only the cantonal police
Concerning the military: While on duty the normal police doesn't really apply to you
They'll just hold you and wait for the military police to show up if necessary
As a civilian it's the other way around as well of course
In cases of emergency, like this pandemic, the military can support civil authorities after their request for assistance was signed off
This lead to military police supporting the border patrol and thus "switching sides" to the civil counterpart for the day
Everything in Italy reminds me of Greece pre crisis
Omg I really love the story about aujourd'hui

In Swiss, a rather interesting word is "putsch". It's one of the very, very few Swiss words that have made it as loanword into English and have thus become globally used
It means more or less the same as the French "coup d'état", which is also used in English
What makes "putsch" an interesting word is that it goes back to a very specific event, namely the [Züriputsch] of September 6, 1839
At the time, the city of Zurich also had a lot of political power over the Canton of Zurich (small villages didn't receive proper representation)
Zurich was governed by very liberal politicians
This enraged the villagers in the rest of the Canton, which was mostly rural and very conservative
Tensions came to a boiling point when the liberals in Zurich appointed a controversial (and liberal) theologian to the theology faculty of the University of Zurich
The conservative citizens of the Canton of Zurich outside of the city saw this as an attempt to destroy the traditional order, so they marched into the city and tried to topple the liberal government
There were several battles between Cantonal troops and rampaging villagers
Originally, the Swiss verb "putschen" meant something like "to push", "to shove (aside)" or "to thrust". After the Züriputsch, which made international headlines at the time, the word entered the German language as a political term ("to thrust aside a government", i.e. to stage a coup d'état)
During WWI, the word was then picked up by British soldiers because the Germans used "putschen" also as a way of describing the act of thrusting out of the trenches to defeat the enemy in a forceful, punch-like manner
In standard German, there are now derivative words such as "aufputschen", which means "to stimulate" or "to excite" (for example when you drink an energy drink)
This term also goes back to the original Swiss "putschen" but the meaning of pushing or thrusting is more figurative here, in the sense of pushing yourself or thrusting yourself forward
If it weren't for a bunch of angry villagers in the 19th century, this derivative words would not exist today ;-)
The word “nostalgia”, an expression proposed in the 17th century in a medical context to describe the mental condition/anxiety displayed by Swiss mercenaries fighting away from home
Only later it has been used in a more general context
I thought it’s the ache/pain (álgos) of homecoming (nóstos)
Either way, I always thought it’s somewhat funny how this was classified as a real medical condition
You finish mandatory school at 16 and most people (about two thirds) then do an apprenticeship and enter the workforce
The other third pursues some sort of additional school, there are **many** options, some of them qualify you for University
The standard way to go to University is to do the Gymnasium (that's a school nothing to do with sports), after 3 years at the end of the Gymnasium you get the Matura (lit
Translation: Certificate of Maturity)
With the Matura you can go and study at any Swiss university in any subject, they have to accept you without any further entry exam (except for medicine)
If you went through the entire school system without repeating a year you'll get your Matura at 19
Since Switzerland has mandatory service for male citizens most male students will take a year between the Matura and starting to study to complete their service (contrary to popular belief this need not be military service, civilian options are available and popular)
Most of my female friends also took a "gap-year" between the Matura and studying, they either spent it working or traveling (or both)
So most people start university at around 20 years old
I started uni at 19 after 4 years of Gymnasium
And I went to the Gymnasium after two years of secondary school
I guess it varies in different cantons
You're right
The details definitely vary from Canton to Canton
But it's roughly the same (especially total duration), I also finished my Matura at 19 and started University a year later to have time for military service
Did you do a gap year between Matura asd starting at Uni
Yes, in my Canton it was 4 years of secondary school followed by 4 years until matura (it was actually changed shortly before I started the Gymnasium from 3
5 years to 4 and today you start secondary school a year later so you only have 3 years of that)
(also I lived in canton Solothurn but went to school in Baselland for secondary and gymnasium, so it's extra weird in my case)
No, I started uni right away
Since I'm female, I didn't have to do military service, and I wasn't really interested in a gap year
Total duration varies as well
Aargau and Basel have one year longer than most other cantons
So a male (after military) from aargau is roughly 2 years older than a female from st
Gallen
In my canton you could choose if you wanted to go after two or three years of secondary school
If you didn't pass the exam in the second year, you could alse retake it in the third
The differences between cantons are wild
I had to take an exam in grade 5 (primary school) to qualify for going to the progymnasium (sek p)
Yes, there's also Langzeitgymnasium that takes 6 years, instead of secondary school and Kurzzeitgymnasium
I don't know a lot of people personally who did that though
Many city names in my area end in -wil, which comes from the term ("wyler", German "Weiler") for a small collection of houses
Zug - comes from the oldgerman word for "to pull" mostly in connection with fishing(pulling out nets)
So basically a place where one goes to fish
As it was probably named by people from an older settlement near by
Another fun one is the places containing -thur or -thurn which derives from celtic "dur" river/water (Winter**thur** , Solo**thurn** , **Thur**gau) I think it's quite cool that the names for these places are that old (literally pre-roman)
Is that the same Wyler as in Bern Wylerfeld
There are of course some more such toponyms
On the online platform of the Historical Lexicon of Switzerland there is a [short article] about them
Also in the Idiotikon you can find articles about it, for example [here] It is also interesting how these toponyms are distributed within the country, you can find out on [ortsnamen
ch]
Imo, the story around "-iacum" is particularly exciting
This addition is celtic-roman and was used to make a claim of ownership (of a roman) in the place-name
But this "-iacum" has changed in different ways depending on the region: In German-speaking countries it became "-ach" (e.g. Zurzach), in French-speaking countries it became "-y", "-iez", "-ier" (e.g. Henniez) and in Italian-speaking countries it became "-ago" (e.g. Brissago)
The breed Rottweiler originated in Rottweil, Germany
"-weil" being the German equivalent of the Swiss German/Alemannic "-wil"/"-wyl".
Probably, yes
"meadow/field near or at the settlement"
You can listen to the local pronunciation [here] (courtesy of Wikipedia)
You just summoned Charli XCX with that comment

Oh absolutely, high German is what we (Swiss German speakers) learn in school and what we generally switch to when speaking German with anyone else who is not Swiss (or not from the German-speaking part of Switzerland)
It can also be quite annoying for people who look "foreign", for example an ethnic tamil girl I know always gets addressed in High German or even English when asked for the ticket in the train
(when the ticket-checker was just speaking Swiss-German to everyone white on the train, and just switched to French or High German when the addressee did not understand the Swiss German
So Swiss German is, at least in my opinion, a different language than Standard German
As we're all fluent in Standard German as well though I'll only speak Standard German when in Germany, Austria and so forth
Kn Switzerland however, I'll speak Swiss German to anybody
If they struggle I'll switch over to Standard German or English (I prefer the latter if the Person struggles with German in general)
For my job I have to call different people quite frequently and after introducing I'll pick one of those 3 languages, whatever works best for the situation
Funny thing is though that some Germans (when I'm in Germany) can't properly identify my noticably Swiss accent while speaking Standard German and they switch to (often somewhat broken) English
So yeah, switching to Standard German is pretty easy, I do it quite often with strangers but very rarely with people I know
Feel free to ask though
In French speaking parts I try my best in French but the conversation often switches to English or a strange mixture of both
But the question is
Do Austrians understand the Swiss better than the Germans do
To be precise the official standard language is Swiss Standard German and not German Standard German, so just like with Austrian Standard German, it will sound different
Yeah but those are differences like 'Reservation' for Swiss German and 'Reservierung' for the normal German
I think the other person meant that the Swiss often mix Swiss pronounciation with German and that makes it difficult to understand (like the famous violent ch/k sounds)
Welp most linguists think standards are bullshit anyway
Also in my experience the hard ch/k sounds is something you rather find on older people, most swiss have an accent but keep those sounds in check
I legit cant come up with a swiss dumpling
I even asked my girlfriend and she is a chef
Maybe im dumb and missing something
but at the moment
I got nothing
Same cant think of anything
Which only makes it more beautiful
Also it's not only us who have bittersweet words like that
Switzerland (my family moved here from Germany)
It definitly has it's downsides, but if you ever heard a Swiss person saying "we aren't that rich because our costs of living are higher" they are lying/lacking perspective
I recently read a comment here where a Swiss person said you couldn't buy anything for 1 CHF or maybe a small piece of candy
You can eat for a day for 1 CHF if you know what to buy
But most simply do not need that, they can easily spend 200 CHF every week for food, pay all their bills and still have more than 2'000 CHF left
And all of that with a less than average wage (my own situation right now)
Also it is incredibly beautiful
Pretty much anywhere you can see huge mountains on the skyline
And that's all I personally need
Financial safety and a beautiful country
Makes you forget how ridiculously and unhealthily conservative some places/people here are
> You can eat for a day for 1 CHF if you know what to buy
Such as
i’d probably keep my swiss one
Yes and I want a pretty blue one with 12 golden stars on it :)
Would definitly want to keep my swiss one, i dont have a "european" identity like 90% of people on  european subs
Lets just hope that never happens
I'd have thought that border control agents would be able to see this kind of information on their screen when they're scanning the passport
I mean its a hypothetical question so he can anwser it anyway
Me neither when travelling between Schengen countries
But just recently I've had a flight from Asia back to Switzerland with transit in Frankfurt
Therefore, I had to go trough passport control in Germany and not in Switzerland
No clue about standard German, we had a version in Bernese dialect though, even though I'm not from Bern
Spelling is horrible cuz idk how to spell this dialect
Chopf u schutere, füess, chnü u füess
(2x)
Ung ouge, ohre, muu u nase
Chopf u schutere, füess, chnü u füess
As you can see, the first 'knees' is skipped because otherwise it doesn't work with the syllables
In Switzerland we learned the german version but prefered the french one in school
The words fit better in the melody in french i think
don‘t know much about the FETO stuff but I‘m still going for the inside job explanation for the coup attempt
just look at how he used the state of emergency to lock up basically everyone who is against him
i dont think the turkish state cares much about the deaths since they can now use them as martyrs
American in Switzerland
Work/Life balance here is ridiculously better compared to the U.S (I joke with my friends back in the U.S that everyday is Friday here)
It's 100% a cultural thing as I wouldn't say Americans are working "harder". They just work more for no reason other than it being cultural
However, there are some big caveats, and that being that if you're very ambitious I think you're better off staying in North America
From my experience "climbing the corporate ladder" is an extremely slow process here compared to the U.S.
So it really depends on what you want to achieve to be honest

[Serious] Have you ever lived outside of your home country
It's one of those things that you have to experience first hand to fully understand
It's not always about the quality or the food itself but what it symbolizes
Like why watching media content in your mother tongue is important (very easy now with the internet)
That's awesome and glad to hear people are understanding about the situation involving multiples
In Switzerland women get a standard 4 months
But a lot of women tweak the system and get more (some justified/some not)
I don't understand the infatuation with a 13th salary
It's the same salary cut 13 ways instead of 12
I'm in the opinion that I'd rather have a larger pay check each month
Am I missing something
Oddly this comment sort of summarizes the attitudes between Europeans and Americans when it comes to work/what can be achieved through one's work
I have two friends (one in the U.S/one in an EU country) that have started their own brewing companies
The one in the U.S was able to find countless bars and shops that were willing to offer his beers
The one in Europe runs into a crazy amount of bureaucracy or resistance
He says he's about to give up
As a consumer I'd far prefer letting the market decide
But maybe that's just a very American mentality of mine
It's a difference in cultures
A French person might be critical as to why Americans need 35 types of hot sauces in a supermarket, and an American might look at a French supermarket Cheese section and wonder why they need that many
It's important in the context of the food culture of said person
Highly doubt anything of that sort will change anytime in the near future
Read up on women's rights in Switzerland
Surprisingly backwards/archaic compared to the rest of the continent
>Also, saying "I don't get the infatuation with extra money" is a little weird, lol
Because it's not extra money
Let's say you negotiate an annual salary of 120,000 EUR a year
With no 13th salary you get 10,000 EUR a month
With a 13th salary you get 9,230
7 EUR a month from January to November, but get 18,461 EUR in December
You're still getting the same amount at the end of the year
You're not getting an extra 10K because you get paid a 13th salary
My point is that I'd rather get the extra 769 EUR a month and get rid of a 13th salary
Unless you negotiate jobs by a monthly salary where you are
According to the Federal Statistical Office, households spent 632 Swiss Francs per month on food and non-alcoholic beverages in 2016
At an average household size of 2
24 persons, that's about 260 € per person
578 CHF per household
I mean if I could afford it that’s what I would do
Never cook and always eat out or get a delivery
If you can afford that that’s pretty cool, you shouldn’t feel bad
I don’t know what this ranking includes to calculate the cost, but I think it probably accounts for rent and housing, which is still much more expensive in Paris than in Swiss cities
However I feel like it doesn’t include other costs such as healthcare, taxes, phone, television and internet bills among others, that are more expensive in Switzerland
All things considered it’s clear that cities like Zürich or Geneva are more expensive than Paris
But some criteria are maybe not always specific to a certain city, so they might not be relevant enough
I hope that one day you guys will be
Hey ... We couldn't really do anything else tbh
Also, we did shoot down aircrafts violating our airspace
It is a good thing as that shows that we didn't just sit around and did nothing
We were scared but were still fighting
Our official policy of the military was never surrender and the message to the civilians stated that Switzerland will never surrender, and anyone stating otherwise is spreading enemy propaganda
*I* think it's a good thing
Also, Switzerland would've just been more work to free for the allies if we intervened, not mentioning the strong stance of neutrality
Belgium and Netherlands got attacked, they didn't choose to abandon neutrality
We did what we had to do to stay neutral, that includes securing the airspace
That was war, it wasn't in peacetime like in Russia, aswell as air travel being nonexistent back then
I know the question isn’t asked to us Swiss, but here’s my take anyway
I believe voting rights are the pendant of paying your taxes
Where you pay you can vote
You give your money to the government, and in exchange you get to choose this governement
And the other way around
I disagree
Voting has consequences, and I think if you want to get a say, you can obtain citizenship
In my opinion, anyone should be able to vote who can prove that he/she is integrated to a certain degree in a place or area, knows the local culture and its needs, is himself/herself clearly affected by possible changes through voting and actively informs himself/herself about all arguments of political problems
There may also be other prerequisites
This would include a few "official foreigners", but might also exclude a few compatriots
In any case, especially with regard to voting "Abstimmungen", I think that would make sense, but it would be quite impossible to implement
Chasch nid s Föifi und s Weggli haa

Usem Lächli gits es Bächli (from the laughter comes a brook
Not sure about the last Word, hat to use Google translate)
Usually said to children when they are being rowdy, because wery often someone ends up crying
Not really common, but one of my faves from my grandma :)
Well that happens to me too if I go to Germany, especially if you're in the city
The funny thing is though that I'm Swiss, speak native Swiss German and thus have a bit of an accent speaking standard German
I understand Standard German perfectly
I speak it perfectly besides the accent
And still most people (baristas, servers, hotel staff etc) switch immediately to English with me
Is pretty fun though and if it makes them feel good then let's continue in English, doesn't matter to me
There is a road near me that crosses the Swiss/French border 9 times in 38 kilometers

Just a black screen on my iPhone, on my MacBook it's some default Apple wallpaper
[Home laptop] - Melchsee-Frutt, Switzerland
[Work laptop] - South Africa
[Phone unlock] - Matterhorn, Switzerland
[Phone lock] - South Africa
All taken by myself and make me smile when I see them
Lock Screen of my phone: [Wolfsschlucht Luzern] taken on a run
Home Screen: [Swiss Alps] in black and white
Hey I also use a [picture of the Matterhorn] as my phone home screen
It’s nothing special but I’m quite fond of it since I took it from the slopes this February just before the lockdown :)
For my locked screen I use [this picture] I took in Lausanne in April of last year
Both are very nice
It makes a difference when you've taken the photo yourself
Brings back memories along with the smile

You had me in the first half, not gonna lie
I have a sweater on, but I'm good
It's kind of winter, so I don't expect to be hot
Probably quite exactly 19°C. It is cool, but not too cold
But it may be a little too low to work
19° C in my bedroom which isn't cold for this room
The heating isn't really working properly
Is a bit annoying since my desk is here too so I have to use one of these radiators you can plug in when I feel like it's too cold
The EEA is open to members of either the EU or EFTA
EFTA however is legally incompatible with customs unions with non-EFTA states, so you legally cannot be both in the EEA and have a customs union with the EU (or be a member of the EUCU), unless the country is an actual EU member
The EEA Agreement abolishes tariffs between it's members
I like the Rumantsch word «chillvosa», a word creation from the English loanword «chill» ("to relax") and the Rumantsch word for beer «gervosa».

Very walkable
Lived here for all my life and never have I ever heard of any crime (robbery etc
) taking place here (in my area)
I tend to go for late night walks in Zürich quite often
Ranging from 10pm to 3am
So far never had any issues, usually if someone stops me to talk it's just to ask for a cigarette
I do dress in a hoodie/cap and pretty dark usually and am male so this might influence it a bit
Not scary looking but not extremely approachable either
There are places where I would feel a bit uneasy due to drunk people/teens hanging out in groups, however that's more of a being aware of my surroundings than a real danger to me
I know people who have been robbed or in a fight but that's outside of clubs, not in random streets at midnight
So all in all I guess it's pretty much perfectly safe
It's even pretty safe in the 'more wicked areas' of the largest cities
[the Alphorn]
I’ve even got a group of guys who meets up every week about a 2km away from my house to play alphorn together so my Tuesday evenings are wonderful
*my friend who lives on the other side of town also enjoys listening to them from his balcony*

You forgot the "[Hackbrett]

I swear the Alphorn being reinterpreted as a giant bong or joint is an absolutely unavoidable occurrence in Swiss middle school life

How are people supposed to guess which of 40+ european countries you are from
There's free water in most big cities in Europe
Just an example:
Yeah, that's fair
But if you're not interested in continent x or country y then don't pretend you can talk about them and know what you're talking about
Yeah
You just have to ask for tap water and it is indeed free at cafés and restaurants
Some places might require you to order something with it though
But water fountains are literally everywhere and they are ideal if you have a bottle you want to refill
Lucerne
beautiful city because its located at the foot of the alpes and at a lake, but there are so many tourists there it's crazy
how to avoid them: don't go there
I’m gonna be honest, there are almost no scams I am aware of here in Switzerland
But you should be cautious about following what travel blogs, influencers  etc
recommend
You’ll just end up in Grindelwald and Lauterbrunnen like every other idiot, when in fact there are other beautiful places to see
I think Grindelwald and Lauterbrunnen are magnificent, but overrun, so less enjoyable
I just write posts in English most of the time

Pro: Great education, stable politics, pretty safe
High wages
Con: everything expensive as fuck
No matter what other country I go to everything is cheaper there (which is nice for vacation though)
pros: great infrastructure, high standard of living, good politics
cons: everything is expensive as hell
I would add [Polyushka Polye] to this list
The red army choir really has some good songs !
probably the 1868 floods
heavy rainfall lead to lakes overflowing, rivers flooding and all around a bad time all over the country
51people died and the damage was about 1billion dollars in todays money
the floods fundamentally changed for Switzerland looks at potential disasters and tries to prevent them

I would argue it’s the earthquake in Basel in 1356
The Basel earthquake also came to mind:
"The 1356 Basel earthquake is the most significant seismological event to have occurred in Central Europe in recorded history and had a moment magnitude in the range of 6
0–7
1 The town within the ramparts was destroyed by a fire when torches and candles falling to the floor set the wooden houses ablaze
The number of deaths within the town of Basel alone is estimated at 300
All major churches and castles within a 30 km (19 mi) radius of Basel were destroyed

Kind of an odd example but many people assume Milka chocolate is Swiss
It’s not, and it’s not even being sold here
Lidl has it, but it’s kind of a « German supermarket in Switzerland
There is nowhere to go where there isn't people
Everything is full of people
Boarding a train or a tram
Full of people
Driving on the road
Full of people in cars
Looking for an apartment
Lots and lots of people, sometimes hundreds
Going to buy food
Migros is full of fucking people
Hike six hours up a remote mountain
Meet people every 5 fucking minutes, and when you reach the top, bam, hundreds of people
The population is growing one medium-large sized city per year, every year
Imagine if in Germany, a new Cologne popped up every year
Year after year after year, a new Cologne is added
It won't be long until even such a large country is starting to feel pretty full
There isn't enough land and there isn't enough infrastructure, and there is no way to keep up with people because there is no land
Fucking people
They're everywhere
Including myself of course
Cost of childcare is probably the highest in Europe (and even maybe the world)
So Pepe Le Pew is closer to reality than we thought
Maybe it’s because I simply don’t buy that often online, but I never really faced that problem
Maybe it’s also more specific to Norway
> we should get about 90% of the Swiss wages
Why
Your cost of living is less than half of ours
Having doube the salary does not equal double the money when comparing Germany to Switzerland
I don’t know where you live in our country, but that has never been a major problem for me
I live in the city center of Lausanne and study in Geneva so I’m around people a lot
While I often notice crowds, it’s always because it’s rush hour
Take the train between Lausanne and Geneva at 7am ? Not an empty seat
Take it at 1pm ? Empty seats everywhere
Same in the streets
Wanna go in town on Satudray
People everywhere
On a Sunday
The city (especially Geneva) is completely empty, looks like a ghost town
But it’s not specific to Switzerland, I’ve seen that happen in pretty much every country I’ve ever visited
When I came back from Japan, Lausanne felt eerily quiet and empty
Honestly surprised people didn't get the joke
In my experience, more a problem to Norway I'd say
Switzerland is most of the times included or just straight up isn't.
What is annoying is Amazon's decisions last few years of limiting delivery to here :I
Our prices are also double of yours, sometimes more
I wish you the best of luck
> it hasn't adjusted to it's neighbours
Buy power is still very similar compared to our neighbours, what's the problem
Your image of Switzerland seems very idealized, and wrongfully so in my opinion
Lots of Swiss people struggle to make ends meet despite their good salary, because the cost of life is so high
You’re only thinking of skilled or long-time employed workers
For what would be minimum-wage workers, life is tough like everywhere else
In your taxes health insurance and state pensions are included, and that health insurance includes dentistry
In our taxes, there is no pension, and no health insurance
The health insurance costs between 3000 and 6000 Euro per year and doesn't include dentistry
Even a minor dental correction costs 10'000 Euro
When you include health insurance and pension into our taxes, it turns out you don't really pay more but you get dental insurance
And then there's rent, which is 2x to 4x of yours, and food, which is 2x yours
Smart people do it like this:
Work in Switzerland (Basel)
Shop in Germany
Life in France/Elsass
> I'm not sure what you mean about pensions not being included for you
Everything I can find via google says you definitely have state funded retirement
Our pension system has three pillars, I don't want to get into explaining that right now
What's relevant for this discussion is: When you google "how much taxes do Swiss pay" the pensions we have to pay are not included in the amount the google results tell you
It is paid separately, when for you it is included in your tax bill
Either you need to subtract pension and health insurance payments from the German tax burden, or, you need to add our three pension systems' amounts plus health insurance to the Swiss tax burden
Then they're somewhat comparable
You'll discover that we both pay something between 10 and 50%, depending on income
> As for rent: Apparently, in Switzerland you pay 190CH per m² per year on average
Average rent is not a good indicator, not for Germany and not for Switzerland, because there are vast differences in price between Hinterfotzigen am Kaff and Berlin Mitte
In reality, it probably ranges 150-800 Euro for a single bedroom apartment in Germany while the range for us is 900-2500 Fr
Probably Bern (Sports fans not included)
It's very cultural, has a beautiful old town, people are friendly and chill and their dialect is kinda cute
Bern or somewhere in Ticino I’d say
I never hear anything mean about Ticino and the place is in my opinion one of the most beautiful in Switzerland

I think that they are sometimes seen as German intruders here
We have our own supermarkets, we don't need them
What I think makes them distinctively non-Swiss is them having prices like 2
49 Fr
which isn't possible because the smallest coin is 0
05 Fr
and that has been the case for over 50 years and nobody puts up dumb prices like that
But our local supermarkets like Migros or Coop are also a lot nicer than Lidl, or also Aldi, for that matter
In fact, I'd be hard pressed to name a popular chain that's more budget oriented than Lidl, even though they improved their image significantly in the past few years
It was founded August 1st 1291 as a country
The federal state as we know it today exists since 1848
729 years
In 1291 three guys went to a field and said "Fuck Austria, we're Switzerland now"
>August 1st 1291
Actually no but that's what we like to say to ourselves
The day was basically picked at random
&#x200B;
More info:
>The Swiss National Day refers to the Federal Pact (1291), the founding act of the Confederation concluded by the representatives of the three original cantons: Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden (which later divided into two half-cantons: Obwalden and Nidwalden)
This original document in Latin was only rediscovered by chance in the 18th century during an inventory of the archives of Schwyz
Before then, the Pact of 1315 was considered the founding text
>In the Middle Ages, there was no national holiday; local commemorations of battles and deaths were celebrated, but no common events
>With the federal state of 1848 and with the aim of consolidating the confederal links between the cantons, all parties and denominational tendencies, the need arose to create a unifying event
>On 14 December 1889, the Federal Council proposed the organisation of a major celebration in all the cantons and particularly in Bern, where the Confederation's birthday would be combined with the 700th anniversary of the federal city
However, the people of Schwyz thought that the main celebration should take place in Brunnen, the place where, in their opinion, the signing of the pact of 1291 took place, which they proposed
The Swiss Federal Assembly agrees and decides to let Schwyz organise the festival in early Switzerland
>The first festival lasted two days, 1 and 2 August 1891
Official Switzerland gathers on 1 August for a large theatrical performance in Schwyz with 960 extras representing the whole of Swiss history with tableaux vivants and patriotic songs
The second part, on 2 August, at the Grütli is a more moving part with the cantata of Tell, a boat trip and illumination of the surrounding peaks with lights
On the other hand, for the cantonal, local and Swiss abroad celebrations, a minimum common programme is laid down: 1st August "Ringing of all the bells at 7 p.m. and bonfires on the heights" and for 2nd August "Divine Service with speeches and patriotic character", any other event is left to the discretion of the cantons and communes
The Swiss colony of Paris organizes a grandiose festival whose date is brought forward to July 12, 1891
>The national holiday of 1891 was planned as a single event
Under pressure from the Swiss abroad, annual celebrations began in 1899
>The 1st of August has been an official holiday throughout Switzerland only since 1994
Until then, 1 August was almost everywhere a working day, only a few cantons (Zurich, Schaffhausen and Ticino) considered it as a legal holiday, while others considered it only a "half day" public holiday
The popular initiative "For a national holiday" was launched in 1991, on the 700th anniversary of the founding of the Swiss Confederation, to make 1 August a public holiday throughout Switzerland
The initiative was accepted by a vote on 26 September 1993
correct:)
Depends on what you consider the foundation of the country
The Westphalia Treaty was merely a *de jure* recognization of Switzerland's independence after years of *de facto* independence
1291 was when Uri, Schwytz and Unterwald made a pact to break free from the Hapsburg which started a series of alliances creating Switzerland (Confederation of Three, Eight, Ten and Thirteen)
The Confederation of Thirteen was to one being *de jure* recognized in the Westphalia Treaty
In Switzerland
+ Lots of "man with a van/truck" services available
+ You can rent a large van by hour/kilometer
+ Delivery
We have very heavy or bulky items delivered
Everything else we transport by public transport
My family has not had a car at all for years
This 'tradition' has been taken over by my girlfriend and me
There have been no situations where we would absolutely need a car
If it would come to it, however, we could certainly ask friends or rent one
Without a car/truck there are basically only very few limitations for us, e.g. it might be a bit difficult to pick up a used sofa at someone's house (although I have transported sofas by public transport)
Ask around group of closest friends or facebook
Rent a Mobility van (Swiss carsharing service)
Pay for a delivery service
Or you can peer pressure your mate who learned a trade into helping you with his company car
Des zones tampons
Not sure about other cantons but we had mandatory cooking lessons in school
Not only cooking but also learning about nutrition, vitamins etc
Same here, except that 99% went home to eat
I think it should be a requirement but the setup is a bit hypocritical if we're honest
In the sense of those who inherit citizenships from their parents/grandparents but never lived/learned the language don't have to go through this requirement (legally)
I know loads of South Americans that hold Italian citizenship (and therefore work around the EU) but don't speak a word of Italian
Why were they not subjected to language requirements the way children of immigrants to Italy would be
When they never contributed (even in terms of taxes/local economy) to the country
If that makes sense
I dont know how all switzerland handles it but i am sure that there are at least 4 different language options (our 4 official languages)
I know Tina Turner had to learn some german for the test, but i have never heard her speak german, so i dont know how much of the language she knows
It annoys the fuck out of me
True
There should be a test for everybody
But in most countries the school system takes good care of that problem in my experience
For Switzerland itself I'd say learn 1 of the languages (meaning German, French or Italian of course), use English in the other parts or go the extra mile and learn that one too
Edit : No, I haven't forgotten Romansh, but it's 0
6% of the nation that speak it
At first I thought you had a stroke
Now I'm leaning towards "I don't give a fuck"
Why you would write a comment like it was a chatroom, is unknown to me, but hey, maybe I'm just too old
This was not the argument
It was according to citizenship, not about living there
Becoming part of society *is* also becoming a citizen of said society, in which you need to learn the language
Makes perfect sense
Don't get me wrong, I understand why jus sanguinis is valid
Just pointing out that there is a bit of hypocrisy in what one judges to be "integration".
Doesn't mean my scenario can't happen in Spain, and I'm sure it does
Disagree
I've met a lot of French people who I later find out have Spanish parents/grandparents, that don't speak any Spanish/Catalan/etc
Granted because of the EU they probably have no reason to get a Spanish passport but the point still stands
Yeah
Let's say there's a French guy that doesn't speak any Spanish but wants Spanish nationality
Turns out his grandmother was Spanish, he can basically get a Spanish passport much easier/quicker than say the Mexican immigrant that moved to Spain and has been/living working there for years and wants to get naturalized
In mine it was just throwing them in a warehouse to gather dust
It’s the same situation in Switzerland in many schools, most notably in the HES-SO network (university-level schools in multiple domains such as arts, management, etc
Except for copyrights, the school owns all intangible rights to the students' creations
I’m not an art student myself, but when my friends told me about it I found it quite shocking too
Wouldn‘t that be before, not behind
As in your summer starts a month earlier
Probably one of the reasons why people often mix up Sweden and Switzerland
8 minutes of walking, 12 minutes by bus, 70 minutes by train followed by another 8 to 10 minutes of walking
I take either a 22 minute bus ride or I drive and it takes 14 minutes
I can also do a mixed tram-bus route that is 18 minutes, but it requires some transfers and is a bit more active, so I usually just take the bus
I get up, ride my bike downhill, then through the city center, over the bridge, by the station and then the road continues by the lake for another 5 minutes
Total time 15‘
Before i go downhill i drive straight towards the mountains and it‘s so fucking beautiful
pretty short, even though I live in the countryside, it's close to the cities
everything in Switzerland is close
Amazing
It’s like Boaty McBoatface, olden days-style
If you go for a walk in a place where there aren't a lot of people and it's somewhat nice you will find Swiss people
Has happened to me in France and Austria
It really surprised me that there is a swiss german langue pack in Minecraft
So, I'm speaking Swiss German and Austrian and i think it was in Seattle, where there was just a huge Graffiti on a Wall saying "Fotzegrind" which is Swiss German for Dickhead (Though it would translate to cunthead)
The other one was when i was in Nice, France and there was written "Oachkatzlschwoaf" which is Austrian for Squirrel Tail and because it's pronunciation is so difficult Austrians often tend to convince foreigners to try to say it so they can laigh their ass of :P
Also, though not tooooo suprising, in Mannheim, Germany i saw the word "Chuchichäschtli" on a toilet which is Swiss German for Kitchen Cupboard and just like Austrians with the previously mentioned word, we try to tell it to foreigners to pronounce it, just to laugh our ass of, that's kind of what we guys with German dialects do
Love the language pack
Its hilarious
People living in the mountains
5 of the 8 million people live in the "flat lands" that only make up 30% of the whole country
Eating Fondue and being able to jodle
- Cheese eaters
- Cows
- Mountains (To be honest there are still many mountains here, but sure not as many as some people think)
And there go my vacation plans for the summer
That's because like at least half of the OG bands are Norwegian
And the crazy stuff that happened in the 90's (Euronymous being murdered, nazis, church burnings) happened there
And there's that one guy called Fenris in Darkthrone who became a mayor or something even though he didn't really want to be it
His election poster was him holding his cat lmao
I always say there are only hills, no mountains
Most under 500m, some maybe around 800m. But certainly not like the Netherlands
Edit: if you want you can google "Zürich Unterland Foto" this gives you an idea
Not living in the flat lands doesn't mean living in the mountains
There are areas that are close to the mountains but not IN the mountains
Lucerne for example
alrighty
Ah, I see you are a (wo)man of culture as well
Love it, also in about every somewhat big store (at least in my area)
Actually this is quite common in Switzerland
Truly
There are a lot of delicious desserts, but if I have to choose one, it's definitely Vermicelles
Cuckoo clocks were not invented in Switzerland (but Germany)
That we're rich because
a) we got all of the gold the Nazis stole
b) we're 99% banks that hoard illegal, untaxed money for rich people
In reality:
a) we got a few hundres million worth of Nazi stuff, nowhere near enough to make us rich, and on top of that we paid that amount back to Jewish communities several times over
b) our finance industry - the whole industry, that includes insurances and whatnot, not just banks - accounts for less than 3% of our GDP
We're successful because of a multitude of factors
If all it took to ve a rich nation were just being neutral and hiding rich people's money then everyone would be doing it
You spelled "rabbit" wrong
Mostly services (>70%), as any developed country
The rest is pharmaceuticals, watches, specialised machinery, chemicals, medical instruments
High-tech, high-price, highly specialised stuff
Wait, seriously
Did Hitler read *any* history books
Seemed to have worked flawlessely

Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Kobe, Sapporo, Yokohama, Nagasaki, Kyoto, Fukushima, Kawasaki, Sendai, Hokkaido, Hiroshima, and Nagano
I think that is about it
Tokyo, Kyoto, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Kobe, Sapporo, Fujiyama(?),
Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, Kyoto, Nara, Kanazawa, Kamakura and Shirakawa-go (a village not a city, does it still count
) as they’re the cities I visited
Off the top of my head I can also name Yokohama, Sendai, Nagasaki, Hiroshima, Kobe, Sapporo, Fukushima and I believe there’s a city named Okinawa on the island ? Not sure
And I have already learned that Hokkaido is an island, not a city
Oops
Now I'm ashamed as a fellow Swiss because I'd at most could've said Nagasaki, Tokyo, Fukushima and Hiroshima
Did you travel to Japan once or twice
(Btw, fuck me
That's like the 5th time I've seen your name)
I went to Osaka once for work
I only know of it because of the beer

As far as I know it’s not a thing here in Switzerland either
Switzerland was one of the founding countries of the EEA
In the end we did not even join, but it’s one of the countries that pushed for it’s creation
Aside from maybe the Fröntler (sympathizers of Nazi Germany during the 1930s and 1940s), Switzerland doesn't have any actual traitors in its history to my knowledge
**However**, we do have several people who were/are **considered** to be traitors by our political authorities
Here are the three most famous ones:
- [**Paul Grüninger**] was a Swiss border patrol officer during the late 1930s. He is credited with saving the lives of roughly 3,600 Jewish refugees by secretly pre-dating their visas
By 1938, Switzerland had closed down all borders and didn't let anyone enter the country anymore
Grüninger knew that these Jewish families would be sent to cocentration camps and he was unwilling to accept this
By making it look as though the entry visas had been issued a long time ago, the Jewish refugees could enter the coutry illegally
Despite Grüninger's bravery, altruism and heroism, his actions were considered deeply illegal at the time
When he was caught by his superiors in 1939, the government put him on trial for over 2 years
In the end, he was found guilty of betraying the country and his service
He was released from his duty without notice, forced to pay all trial costs and the court took away his entire pension
For the remaining 30 years of his life, Grüninger lived in poverty and ostracized by Swiss society
The federal government never properly apologized to him until his death in 1972 and his case was never re-opened
He wasn't given back any of his pension
Thanks to political propaganda, most Swiss people still viewed Grüninger as a traitor in the early 2000s. Despite all of this, he never regretted his actions and said in an interview in the 1950s that he would do everything the same if given another chance
It was only by the 2010s that he was finally rehabilitated
- [**Christoph Meili**] was another brave guy in charge of safety and security
In 1997, he was employed by the Swiss bank UBS as a night guard
During one of his lonely strolls through the deserted hallways and office spaces of the bank, he came across several large heaps of files that UBS employees had been instructed to destroy the next morning
As he was a little bored, curiosity got the better of him and he began to casually read through some of the files on top of the pile
What he saw there deeply shocked and troubled him
The files dated back all the way to WWII and they referred to orphanaged assets that had been owned by Jews and then been seized by the Nazis
The documents proved beyond a doubt that UBS had not only cooperated with the Nazis to rob the Jews but had also tried to gets its own greedy hands on the Jewish assets after the war
And now UBS was about to destroy all of this incriminating evidence
Christoph Meili immediately sat down, went through all the papers, sorted out the most important ones, made photo copies and took home these copies
A few days later he came forward as a whistleblower
Sadly, the authorities reacted very unkindly to his brave actions
They put him on trial and charged with with several crimes, including a violation of the banking secret
Faced with a long prison sentence, Meili took his family and together they escaped to the US where they received political asylum
- [**Rudolf Elmer**] used to be a banker at the private Swiss bank Julius Bär. In the early 2000s he became aware of numerous illegal activities that his bank was committing in the Cayman Islands for the purpose of tax evasion
He eventually came forward as a whistleblower by collecting evidence and giving it to Wikileaks
Neither his bank nor the Swiss authorities were happy about this
He was dismissed from his job and his career was pretty much destroyed
The Swiss government imprisoned him twice
Like Christoph Meili, he is currently one of the most vilified people in Switzerland
After his case became public, some politicians began to argue for stronger protections for whistleblowers but unfortunately not much has been done till this day
I'm also swiss, but that's the first time I heard of them
I assume it got swept under the rug pretty quickly
The government really doesn't want to talk about what happened during that time, understandibly so
As well as it being seen as "A thing that had to be done to secure our country" at that time, meaning he still risked our country during that time
It most likely also has to do with our half direct democracy being slow as fuck
(Not saying it's justified, just trying to find some possible reasons)
Good luck invading the longest standing neutral country with no reprucussions lol
Never heard of any of them, so I wouldn't say they're well known either way
I didn’t hear about it, what happened exactly ?
In Switzerland it is called ***Eidgenössisches Departement für Verteidigung, Bevölkerungsschutz und Sport (VBS)***, in French ***Département Fédéral de la Défense, de la Protection de la Population et des Sports (DDPS)***, in Italian ***Dipartimento Federale della Difesa, della Protezione della Popolazione e dello Sport (DDPS)***, in Romansh ***Departament Federal da Defensiun, da Protecziun da la Populaziun e Sport (DDPS)*** and in English ***Federal Department of Defense, Civil Protection and Sport (DDCP)*** and it is currently headed by Federal Council Viola Amherd of the Christian Democratic People's Party
Because essentially we decided that the promotion/advancement of physical exercise and various sports clubs should have a high enough priority in Switzerland that it should be among the core issues/duties that our Federal Council has to deal with
Now, the tricky part in Switzerland is that our Federal Council consists of 7 members and that's it
In other countries you can have a President or Prime Minister and a bunch of different ministries
If government duties grow over the years, you can simply add another ministry
For example in the US they've got like 15 different departments for all sorts of stuff
In Switzerland, that's not possible because the Federal Council is the executive branch
So, basically these 7 people need to deal with everything
Of course they can higher more staff in their respective departments but in the end, they're still the boss and the ones who have to oversee everything
So if new issues or duties come up, such as that of sports, we need to squeeze them in wherever they fit best
The thought process in this cases probably was something like: "well, soldiers do a lot of physical exercise, so the military and sports go well together". We have similarly exotic combinations on the Cantonal and municipal level
For example in my city we have a department for education and sports and another one for security and environment
So if you're the head of the department for security and environment, you're on the one hand dealing with the city's police force, crime and that sort of stuff but on the other hand also with questions such as "how can we make the city more green". It must seem quite odd from other countries' perspective ;-)
Never really been a fan of mountains
It got better with time but still
In China, a bag of rice falls over
(when someone says something extremely irrelevant you counter it with this equally irrelevant info)
«Das kommt mir spanisch vor» ( = that seems Spanish to me)
**Meaning:** I don't understand this
/ I'm not following
«Hinter schwedischen Gardinen sitzen» ( = to sit behind Swedish curtains)
**Meaning:** Being in jail / prison
«Und ich bin der Kaiser von China
» ( = and I am the emperor of China
**Meaning:** Is an answer to an unbelievable statement
«Etwas türken» ( = to "turk" something)
**Meaning:** faking something
We have "sich französisch verabschiede", to say goodbye in the French way, describes the act of leaving without saying goodbye
No idea why it's the French way though
Wearing luxury watches
I grew up in cultures where if you were wearing (say) a Rolex most people assumed it was fake, or you were swimming in money/trying to show off
Meanwhile the dude next to me in the bus is wearing a Patek like it's no big deal
Because here in Switzerland (the land of luxury watches) it's really not a big deal
On a similar note
We were waiting for the bus once while it was raining and a lady casually rode her bike past us getting soaked by the rain
My wife freaked out because apparently she was wearing a 10K+ Hermes purse and letting it get wet
Most women we know would be putting that in 2 plastic bags and under their coats
We do that too
Horse meat I'm ok (though I'll try to avoid it)
But Horse meat tartare (raw) is where I draw the line
Not nude in Switzerland (even the Swiss German side), France, Italy in my experience
There are signs specifically outlining that you need to be clothed
And one time a hilarious sign asking Asian customers not to bring in salt
Awkward on how one of the most known tanks in WW 2 carries his name
Well, there also was the Bismarck on the German side, seeing as Bismarck also wasn't always great
This stuff wasn't covered in Extra History
Good to know I suppose
In before some idiot strolls along and believes this crap
I wouldn't put it past some people
Ouch
Well, speaking of killing dogs, the Wehrmacht killed a lot of them
Probably due to the fact the Soviets used them as anti tank weapons
They were actually quite effective, thus the reason to shoot any dog passing
Is it dumb if you make lots of money
(France) I’m gonna go with the [sabordage de Toulon] , when we scuttled almost our entire navy (77 ships sunk) in 1942 to prevent the nazis from taking it
To be fair it was only the second dumbest solution, close behind handing over an entire fleet to the germans, which would have turned the war in the mediterannean
If they had predicted the german commando attack on Toulon, they might have had the time to join forces with the british navy in North Africa
Don't worry
You are not alone
Germany is not the only country stupid enough to invade Russia in winter
Although we have been a regular federation since 1848, but just kept the old name (and of course back then confederation and federation weren't yet separate things)
Only from Civ4 onward
In Civ3 this trick worked probably exactly once, but everyone disliked you and refused to have open borders with you afterwards
It's not about when you start your invasion but when you end it
Tell that to the people that let the Russlandfeldzug start at least a month later than originally planned
Most invasions aren't won in a day
Of course, it might also have been dumb to even think to be able to win a war against Russia before winter breaks
But then maybe the war itself was a dumb idea and that was what OP was referring to and it was a dumb idea of mine to make a dumb joke about it
Liechtenstein
In a nice reversal of the usual design theirs are [white numbers on a black background]
I honestly also like the [Swiss ones] we've got the swiss flag on the left and the cantonal flag on the right (canton = federal subdivision of Switzerland), double the flags double the cool xD
Btw
while searching for the pictures I found [this website] with pictures of "almost all number plates of Europe" (at least according to the website itself)
AND did you know that the Liechtenstein licence plates appear white with black number when you illuminate them in the dark
That's really cool
I am so confused right now
The St
Gallen flag is older than any facist movement in Europe
Same in Switzerland
Damn I never made that connection
Guess it's just very normal for us to see that cantonal flag here and there
No offense but if I saw a Wolfsangel in Germany I wouldn't have the same reaction to it as seeing the flag of St
Gallen here in Switzerland
It's probably just our different perception of history and my age that make this kinda stuff easier to overlook
I would expect the awareness for such things is a lot higher in Germany than it is here
But it is certainly interesting how such symbols pretty much got abused for like 10 years by the nazis and many lost their initial meaning they represented for hundreds of years before
Fun related fact: The saying "jedem das Seine" is still somewhat common in some regions in Switzerland
I got a lot of bad looks when I dropped it in a hotel reception area in Germany once, only later realizing why the Germans weren't as friendly anymore suddenly
Affordable restaurants and street food
Fun and laid back people, also cheap stuff
I feel like I actually have money and don't have to spend half a fortune in everything, when I'm outside of Switzerland
Never would have thought this is not a thing in germany
Kebab: 9
40€ and some cheaper ones at 7
80€
Pizza takeaway: 9
40€ and in normal restaurants atleast 14€ .
Hamburger as a cheap example mcdonalds where the big mac menu is around 13
50 and only the burger for around 7€. Outside of Mc and BK Hamburgers arent really a street food
There are really good burger restaurants tough where you can easily pay more than 20€ just for one burger
Yeah it really isnt comparable, I also wasnt complaining just explaining it
Regular pizza in boxes
Al taglio isnt too common here but I cant confidentialy say the same about all of Switzerland
Yeah I actually don’t know where he found a pizza for 14€, as far as I know it usually costs around 19€. But meat here is very expensive so I think that’s why kebabs are disproportionnaly expensive
Maybe he meant only a slice or half a pizza
Because I don’t know where I can find a whole one for such prices
Pizzeria la Piccola in St
Gallen
Whole pizzas for 9
50CHF as a takeaway and 10CHF if you want to sit on a few bar tables
Well now I’m jealous, and I can’t even go to St
Gallen for a pizza
You treasure it
I was taught that when I learned to writw cursive in school
I actually thought the same, but I use it for small and caiptal z’s. I don’t really know where it comes from bc we were not taught that in school I think
It‘s been slowly fading out of my writing over the past few years now though because I had to learn how to do the „Neue Basisschrift“ (the new official way kids are taught how to write each letter) as part of becoming a teacher
I‘ve never seen it in print before though
Most people have one, some don't, some also have more than just two
Most people don't use their second names, some include them in their initials, a few people usually write both names
I know quite a few people who hate their middle name for some reason but I think their hate isn't justified in most cases
Parents are required to give their child a second name if the child's gender doesn't become obvious from the first name (e. g. Andrea)
Some families have naming traditions linked to middle names but those vary between families and most don't have traditions at all
I have my father's first name as middle name but that isn't a tradition in my family and my parents only did that because they wanted me to have one and they couldn't think of anything else because they were already kinda struggle to even find one name for me
Me and a lot of my friends have middle Names
We just don't tell many people
common and useless
One oddity (I really don't know much about American habits) is the contrast between a seemingly big need for 'home safety' (shotgun in the bedroom yada yada) but then you build front doors that a random punk can kick in
Good luck trying to kick in doors in Europe
The only thing you'll achieve is getting your foot broken
There's absolutely nothing here in Switzerland
Architects and urban planners seem to be confident about, that mastering a right angle and using enough cement makes up a good architecture
I don't think that a "Princess" could ever represent us, our entire foundation myth (yes, it absolutely is only a fictional myth) is about sticking it to feudal structures
According to those myths we're nothing but descendants of 13th century [rebels against the Austrian Royalty]
That all said: If Disney were to appropriate any Swiss story it'd probably be [Heidi] they'd probably give her a goat as a sidekick (or maybe a Saint Bernard - even though the Heidi story takes place in an entirely different region of Switzerland than where you'd find Sait Bernards) .
Edit: Typo
Any sidekick that isn’t a cow can get lost
Oh god
I hadn't even considered that, the horror
Pssst
We like to pretend that we forgot about that
As Maui sais to Moana: [If you wear a dress and you have an animal sidekick you are a princess
Rüeblifrässer sy sy gsy, diä Aargauer
not the winter war, but Finnish independence after ww1
I am reminded of the most recent one
SWISS GOVERNMENT DECLARES COFFEE NON-ESSENTIAL was the global headline
I even had friends from the USA email me about it
How could we declare coffee non-essential
Everyone loves coffee
How dare we do such a silly thing
We had weird people threatening to blow up Sweden, and questioning the law makers in Stockholm (and even a few naming Bern)
We had news people stating that this is craziness, and unhinged Americans threatening to shoot anyone who came for their coffee
The international news tied it to bank secrecy, nazi gold, CERN, Nestle scheming, UN pressures, direct democracy gone mad, and lots of other things
SWISS hate COFFEE
How dare they
Internet and world UNITE against this Helvetic madness
The reality of the situation was the Swiss government was debating if stockpiling coffee in the strategic reserve was a logical thing for the budget
The Swiss government maintain stockpiles if essential goods in case we are every blockaded during a war, which historically included coffee
Coffee is expensive, and although we all love it, you will not die from not having it
I mean really DIE, not be unhappy, DIE
For the same cost of maintaining rotation of coffee stock, we could store more food, water or medicine, things that you actually would DIE without
This was the debate
Should we keep a strategic coffee stockpile for a future blockade of Switzerland in a war, or not
It was not a referendum on if coffee is good, or if anyone should be drinking it, or banning coffee
It was another example of a Cold War program needing trimming as the chance of a blockade is small today
The [minarets referendum] issue
First of all, we get right-wing populist "appeals to gut-feeling" referenda like this *all the time*, most are defeated comfortably, and even if accepted (like this) their implementation is usually so watered down so as to not really be an issue any more
We know how to deal with this shit
And the minarets thing wasn't even that bad
It's a roof element for fuck's sake
We are mainly concerned with conserving our picturesque skylines rather than oppressing muslims
I saw many dozens of tweets from random Americans threatening to invade Switzerland over this
lol
It was weird at first, but the attention was deserved since to this day we still don’t know if the parents themselves might be culpable or not, after several witnesses incriminated the mother especially
If that is true, the whole media campaign to find madeleine was the biggest lie ever
> Supposedly Germany has it also
Switzerland has the same law
No one gets support form the state when they have things of value
Counts for refugees but also for citizens
But this situation was mainly blow up by UK media itself
And yes the story was constructed to hurt Corbyn and Labour
Have you seen the Al Jazeera Doc
about it
>No, do you have a link
Sure
please tell me what you think after watching it
> I'm wondering how many countries the Israeli government is covertly interfering in
They do it everywhere
All lobby-work
Here is a Swiss Politician (right wing)
-Oh he got invited to Isreal
-Oh he submited a motion against NGO's who help Palestine
There is also one about the lobby work in US-Politics
Taking the train and bus everywhere
Being annoyed at a minor delay in busses or trains
Being 15 minutes too early to *anything*.
I was riding the escalator and (as everyone should) standing on the right side so people could pass on the left
In front of me was someone standing on the left side so I started walking only to be able to say "excuse me" before passing them so they knew they had to stand on the right
This rule is sacred but as far as I know only in Zürich
Using public transport all the time, be frustrated because of minor delays, being frustrated because I was slightly late, eating cheese, eating chocolate
For me it was being annoyed at the train arriving 1 minute too late
Only happened once and it was a sheit day
Speaking Danish
Everyone else just laughs their asses of because of the language
>Being 15 minutes too early to anything
Wait, what
I thought I was being stereotypical by always arriving exactly on time
Even if it means actually arriving in the vicinity early, and then wasting time by walking around the area so can can then show up *exactly* on time
Also, if we were to meet up at 15:00, obviously everything from 15:00:00 to 15:00:59 is perfectly acceptable, so we're quite relaxed about the whole punctuality thing I'd say
"Oh hey, I'm a locksmith
You need help
What are you saying
15:00:01 is already the death sentence by our secret service EXIT
Nope, at least to my knowledge, but busses *sometimes* do
Trains always have to wait until the departure time has passed, like 1s after
So you better not stop running if you're running late or start walking as soon as you see the train
It **will** depart without you 9/10 times
I've seen it happen *once* in now 3 years of travelling by train daily that the train driver unlocked the doors again after somebody came up the stairs
**Then** the person missed the train because he was too stupid to realize that the doors were unlocked after he pressed the button once (they were locked on the first press, then unlocked half a sec later and unlocked for solid 5-10s)
Tried to run to him to open the door to him because he's an idiot, but didn't make it in time
Also known as speaking with a potato in your mouth
No, but random chance always exists
I am a dual citizen and do like the fact that there are no restrictions on that end from either of the two countries
I'm still surprised that this can be a somewhat controversial topic in some countries
Reading some of the replies in this thread, in an audience that overall is most likely more progressive than the average population, I'd argue that to some people it is somewhat controversial
That used to be my assumption too, but reading in German-speaking forums/newspapers has changed that quite a while ago
Growing up it honestly never occurred to me that to *some* my dual citizenship would appear as controversial if I were in another country
Wasn't able to follow it's development as i was too young, but i do know that here gay people still can't donate blood
Went to do so with a friend some months ago and got denied
He was told to say to us that it was because of high glucose or some shit, but the official reason was that they do not accept donations by people that had homosexual intercourses in the prior few months
the question on the paper was something like "did you have any unprotected sexual intercoures in the last x months
" and it was exactly the same one for homosexual intercourses
I answered yes to the first and no to the second, my pal did the opposite
I could donate, he couldn't
The nurses themselves were sorry about it and agreed on the stupidity of this norm, but that was it
I find the Italian language the most beautiful to hear
Mine is French
It can be very seductive
I really enjoy hearing russian
For me it feels gentle and warm
And in women sexy
I honestly don't mind/care
But I've noticed that during the morning hours, ragging on the U.S seems to be an easy karma grab on must subs
(specially on r/soccer)
I hate the muricans calling the French cowards
They're not
In Switzerland the jokes are mostly about the fact that they don't have the bidet
I didn't really have one, but my mother would call me "müsli" or "bärli" sometimes
basically "little mouse" or "little bear".
My mother called me and my brother « les petits loups », the little wolves
And later when we were older it changed to « les grands loup », the big wolves
Im biracial, father is Peruvian, mother is Swiss and we mostly speak Spanish at home
Mom never uses anything specific to refer to us as children, mostly just the names
My father on the other hand refers to us girls as the princesitas (little princesses) and when including my baby bro it's mis amorcitos (my little loves)
He's a very over the top affectionate type tho, parents of friends often refer to them as the children (los niños/d Chend)
Eh Digga räum mal dein Zimmer auf amenakoi
Muesli is the grain based cereal
Müsli means small mouse
I'm sure to almost everyone on earth they look similar and would sound very similar, but there is a difference
Words are written phonetically in Swiss German, so even the spelling isn't standard, but people know if you mean mouse or cereal
I'd pronounce Muesli like Müesli and the other as Müsli
A lot of the vagueness of Swiss German comes from the length of vowel sounds and how one would write them down
It is not unusual in my dialect to see words with two or even three U or O next to one another, and sometimes one with an umlaut
We also have the h making vowels long, like in standard German, and the UE combo as well
I would say that in this case the UE combo sounds slightly different in tone from the ü, with a bit of a tighter lipped nasal U sound
The ü sounds like a more conventional long u sound, although relative to standard German, I would say it sounds more in length like three Us in a row
Muuusli is the sound for small mouse, and the cereal is more like Muhusli, with the U shorter than one might expect and make that h very soft and short so it is just  kind of a tonal change to the U. Of course, drive to the next city and it is a little different
lol
It's pronounced müesli
One can see that spelling used here as well sometimes, but müesli or muesli are more common
First of all, i don't think duolingo is good at _teaching_. It's good at giving you a basic vocabulary which will be enough to survive as a tourist in a foreign country
This said, for italian it is just very reductive
I had a friend from inner Switzerland using duolingo to learn italian and i would sometimes practice some conversations with him, we quickly realized that duolingo lets you memorize some sentences and that's it
I remember being told in school that I'd be able to communicate in basic german after getting the b1, then we went on a school trip in Stuttgart and i was at restaurants like "ich brauche etwas zu essen"
Doesn't quite fit your question but in swiss penal law, by definition, men can't be victim to rape
Art
190 StGB
Any person who forces a person of the **female sex** by threats or violence, psychological pressure or by being made incapable of re- sistance to submit to sexual intercourse is liable to a custodial sentence of from one to ten years
"Raping" a man is still punishable, but under a different Article
What's so bad about betting
It's already limited to adults only
And it makes watching sports games more "thrilling" in my opinion
Of course if you lose you can't blame anyone else than yourself
What about weed
Oh it's reddit
I think this stuff smells so bad and should be illegal in public
Or when boarding a train and they take One More Drag before chucking the butt to the tracks and get on the train, exhaling their stench all through the carriage =/
Pilatus Dragon, a dragon that lives on mount Pilatus in Lucerne
Also there‘s a myth that Pontius Pilatus, the guy who some would call responsible for the crucification of Jesus, is burried in a lake on that mountain
Oh wow, do you think the house-elves in Harry Potter are based on your kaukai
I had no idea Tomte Tummetott has a mythological background
I loved that story as a kid
Ooh
Have you ever heard of Astrid Lindgren‘s „Tomte Tummetott“? It sounds like he could be a nisser
It used to be one of my favourite books as a kid
Germany, Switzerland and Austria are producing and playing the crime series « Tatort » together, usually playing on sunday night on ARD, SRF, ORF
I’m from Switzerland
The stereotype I hate is foreigners thinking we’re all rich
One I find amusing, .. I need to think
I thought German sounded harsh and was hard to learn
(Studied for +10 years at school), well that was until I heard Swiss German
I find the rich thing hella amusing
Even if I’m broke as fuck, I like to pretend and act like I’m super rich with my foreign friends
Probably because that’s the closest I’ll ever be to actually being super rich
I never heard the one about French woman are hairy (I heard this for Portuguese women though)
I’ve heard the one that you guys are always going on strike though, but this one must come from jealousy as strike is forbidden here
I should try it then ! Oh, most of my foreign friends also assumed at one point that I am/was/might have been working as a banker
That’s true but then everything like rents, insurances, taxes etc is twice as expensive
Ahah that’s true !
Exactly
I used to find this stereotype, like we’re all rich, funny but after a few times it gets boring ahah
Our central bank ceased to maintain a somewhat constant rate between the frank and the euro
Is he viewed positively in Slovenia
My grandparents were too young to participate in ww2, but my German grandfather escaped from now Poland via train with his mother when he was six
He still says Poland belongs to Germany
My grandmother wasn't alive at the time of ww2
My Italian grandfather was also too young, but he told stories of collecting every scrap of metal to sell and another story where Americans came into Italy and he saw the first black guy ever
Different times
He still has an unexploded grenade and he had a gun until the police took it from him
I got to shoot the gun once
One of my great grandfathers changed the family name because he wanted to go to the military and our name at the time wasn't "German enough" lmao so we weren't allowed in the military
Anyway, two great grandfathers died in the second World War and one survived with wounds
Idk what happened to the other
I never met any of them
Edit: might be confusing but I'm German and Italian but was born and raised in Switzerland and have the Swiss passport, so I consider myself Swiss
Probably 0
Would've made a good joke though
I'd like to have such a "slice of life" life where my adventurous uncle takes me around the world chasing after hidden treasures
:-)
Sure, Donald being Donald, he'd rather be chilling in his hammock instead of being paid pennies for being dragged around the world but the nephews enjoy that life thoroughly
Here in Switzerland we call a dryer "Tumbler".
"Handy" for a mobile phone
"Oldtimer" for a classic/antique car
"Beamer" for a digital projector
"Hometrainer" is an exercise device you have at home (e.g. exercise bike)
"Smoking" is a tuxedo
"Public viewing" is a public screening, usually sport events
Like when restaurants or bars show an important match on a big screen for everybody to watch
And we call it a Drive-In instead of Drive-thru
I'm guessing this is because many would have problems pronouning the "th" in thru
Same here in Switzerland
Also, don't order food on the menu that has no price to it
Even if everything else is cheap
They will make you pay 10x the amount if you order it
(as a parent) No school on Wednesdays
So reading this thread it seems that students need to get voting rights asap
Not that i am generally in favor of lower voting age, but these answers show that politics is completely irresponsive to the needs of the people who actually go to school
People get put in boxes super early
As soon as kids are 12-13, (when they reach middle school) they get put in either 3 “regroupements”
1; 2; and 3
Regroupement 3 (also called R3) is only composed of the good students
The ones that have a chance at highschool and then college
R2 is the middle ground
They have a possibility of going to college, but only after an extra year and most fail that year
They either go to a “general culture school” after middle school which will help them go into different jobs, such as nursing for exemple, or they start an apprenticeship at the age of 15-16, to become a butcher, for example
Then there’s R1
These are the troublemakers, the bottom class, the “idiots”. They basically are forced to do an apprenticeship, but will be chosen last if people from R2 or R3 are available
Again, this is switzerland
Apprenticeships aren’t as negatively seen as in France, for exemple
The Matura (paper to go to uni) is only held by 20% of the whole population
People can make a really good living with apprenticeships by joining the workforce later on
I just find it sad that people get put in boxes so early, because it discourages the kids, and of course, friends influence, so if you have a class full of troublemakers, there’s practically no chance you’ll change, even if you have huge potential and just started out on the wrong foot
Btw: kids have the possibility to change regroupments every year, either going up or down
I think thats somewhat exclusive to France in Europe
The US seems to have a similar situation though
Isnt Macron trying to change this and making other educational paths more standard
Wednesdays *afternoon*
I'd put the lack of quality control on a higher priority
Joining the Matura showed me just how different school was in not even just cantons, but fucking regions if not towns
Reddit also carried the same message
I feel like it improved the efficiency of education drastically
But ideally it is done subject-specific and with the possibility to change later still
Centuries old tradition of Wednesday being the day children are supposed to help out at home/farm
Except that has absolutely no relevance today
Nope
The whole day in every single primary school as far I know
Great in what sense
I had school on wednesday mornings 7 years ago
*fuck*, that was 7 years ago
What canton
For us it was just wednesday afternoon (Solothurn, for reference)
Geneve
And I'm 100% sure I could do my job in 2/3 of the weekly hours
Doesn't mean my employer would be thrilled by my "efficiency".
Having the whole Wednesday off has changed as of approximately 6-7 years, at least in Geneva
Not primary school
Read the post people
Yes primary school
What are you talking about
What side of geneva are you in
At least in Carouge it’s changed 6 years ago
There is no school at all on Wednesdays until 5P in Geneva
I can't speak on Carouge
Okay
Then you’re probably right
Thanks for letting me know
Let's go around the horn
**Italy** - *Vitello Tonnato*. Looks a bit bland and iffy, but trust me it's refreshingly delicious and oddly comforting
One of my favorite summer dishes
**France** - *Tripes à la lyonnaise*. I was a bit worried when the waitress second guessed my order
But I'm glad I stuck to it
Gelatinous, fatty, enriching, filling
Do NOT pair it with foie gras like I did one time though, thought I was gonna choke from the richness
**Portugal** - *Caldo Verde*. The decription made it seem like a simple Soup de Jour the restaurant put together because they didn't have anything else to serve
Ate it every single chance I got
Loved it
Cheap
Warming
Delicious
Only issue
ONE piece of chourico in each bowl
But apparently that's the tradition
**Spain** - *Pan con Tomate
* Thought it was a bit odd that my Spanish friend said this was her favorite thing to eat for breakfast
Yeah, I get it now
Spanish (and Greek) tomatoes are on another level for some reason
**England** - *Scotch Eggs*. Who wants to eat a deep fried boiled egg while drinking
The British
But it was so damn good, and now I make sure to get one if I'm at a pub that serves them
**Greece** - *Greek Yogurt*. It's not even a yogurt to me, it's something else
I'm not even one to particularly enjoy dairy, but I could eat a barrel of real Greek Yogurt
Greek food in general is so underrated
Greek yogurt/feta cheese abroad tastes nothing like the real thing
Likewise I don't know how they make a simple Tomato/Onion salad taste so incredible
The flag of the helvetic republic, when we were one of napoléons puppet states
the flag of the Helvetic Republic (napoleon's puppet government of Switzerland) is just generally very ugly
Question to your flair
what the hell is an afro-German
Just never heard it
The afro-xxx is rather an American thing I'd say
I honestly never heard of that term
I mostly either just see them as German or from whereever they come from
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
Here we go
(and I'm just starting to realize a lot of them are very erotic)
Chalk that up to teenagers being sexually frustrated
"Verde/Blanco" - Basically your squad (must all dress it one color) v. another squad (in another color)
Lined up facing each other
About 60 liters of beers between both teams
First one to finish their case wins
If you puke you're out and the rest of your team has to compensate
(In the U.S we play Anchorman and the idea is similar - but with far less puking)
"Jaj shot". You basically sit a length away and lob something (sandball at the beach for ex) in the air aiming to hit each other's groin
You move closer with every miss
"Chicken" - Two guys/girls basically start the process of kissing/or touching each other
First one to "chicken out" loses
"Truth or Dare"/"Spin the Bottle" - With the most common "dare" being "seven minutes in heaven" which was basically an excuse to makeout with someone for seven minutes (or more realistically - awkwardly stand there in the dark doing small talk)
"Maltupakki" - Korean game that's way too complicated to explain
So I'll just leave this video
Damn that reminds me of a game wa used to play where all the kids tried to get on top of a boulder and tried to knock everybody else off there
And for us it wasn't the car type or color, but the license plate
If you saw a number at least 3 consecutive times (e.g. 555) on a license plate you could punch your sibling (or friend, but mostly a sibling) in the arm
We use the word Chuchichäschtli for this purpose
The CH sound in Swiss German is a back of the throat sound akin to choking, so this word captures all the beauty of the language
I have mutliple cases:
&#x200B;
When in Germany:
I use this sentence mostly when a german asks me why I don't have a heavy swiss accent when talking standart german
I say: "Ig würd ja bärndütsch redä, aber de würdisch mi nüm verstah"
German: "Ich würde ja Berndeutsch reden, aber dann würdest du mich nicht mehr verstehen
English: "I would talk in Bernese German if I could, but then you wouldn't understand me anymore"
No one has ever understood a single word
Oh and of course: Chuchichäschtli or Chäschüächli (Kitchendrawer and Cheesecake)
&#x200B;
When someone thinks he would understand me:
And when I really wan't to annoy someone I say: "Gö mir hinech bluttere uf d Chrömi ga choddere
This sentence doesn't really have a meaning, I just tried to put as many bearly known and older Bernese german words into the sentence
Wich means "Do you want to go spitting on cookies this evening without wearing shoes
German: "Gehen wir heute Abend barfuss auf Kekse spucken
This sentence is a really old Bernese German and the only person I know who would understand this sentence is my grandma
This is how this sentence would be spoke out today (by a teen or younger person, some older people still use the word "hinech" (this evening/ later this day: "Gö mir hüt am abä Bluttfues uf d Güetzi ga spöiä?"
&#x200B;
When I meet someone from Switzerland who isn't from Bern
I just try to use the word "äuä" as much as I can
Chuchichästli, best word ever
I noticed that it is written on Migros bakery bags
There seems to be an unreasonable amount of work in a video that really doesn't even need to exist
Even in ticino it is
Ah shit, here we go again
Any of them except Zürich, Bern, Basel, Geneva or Lausanne (and maybe some tourist towns like Zermatt)

Plot twist, he had a typo
Funnily in swiss german its said as: "gärn"
It is impossible to make friends after you finish school
So, Reddit basically
I don't understand either, I'm not old enough yet
I've heard that a lot of people here find it difficult to make friends after they finish school e. g. if they move to a different city
This is one of the reasons why a lot of people have ridiculous commutes here: they don't want to leave because they wouldn't know anyone at the new place
Forgeiners also say they find it difficult to make friends
If you're doing some sort of sport or are in some other sort of association, you might make friends there though
The stereotype is of course exaggerating but still true to some extent
In residential homes it's basically unheard of in Switzerland
If anything, you might occasionally see a ceiling fan (or a portable one like I use)
In some public places they've started to crop up recently
In larger shops or malls you might have central AC
In office spaces it depends I'd say
In public transport there's AC, but they don't cool the air down to an absolute temperature, instead they'll just cool it by 5-7 °C relative to the outside temperature
And they've gotten quite a bit of flack for that during the recent heatwaves
Also in hospitals or retirement homes it's by no means guaranteed to have AC
We change our constitution all of the time
It can be changed through a popular initiative or a proposal of parliament
It always has to be approved by the people in a vote
~~The last~~ A recent one which got approved was the mass-imigration-initiative in 2014, but we vote on some all the time
The last revision of the whole constitution was in 1999, which simplified it and cleaned it up
Edit: I missed at least one constitution change in 2018, which was the counter proposal of the Federal Council for the Bycicle Initiative
Well our first constitution was coined in 1848, before that Switzerland was pretty much just an alliance between the cantons
after that, we made some small changes in 1866, to give more equality to Jewish people, then there are the "first -" and "last total revisions" in 1874 and 1999, which changed a bunch of stuff
Well that's a fun thing here in Switzerland
We're quite famous for our right to "make our own laws" by voting
Well part of this is called the initiative, basically someone proposes a new addition/change, get enough people to sign it (just like a petition) and then the wole country just votes on that
A bit simplified but you get the gist
We do not have the power to make direct laws
We can only make changes to the constitution
So of course some stuff like equal rights or whatever absolutely has its place there
But just a few years ago we voted wether or not to additionally support farmers that don't cut off the cow's horns and thus keep it more natural
That was an initiative
It got denied by voting but if it weren't it would have gone straight to the constitution that here cows should have horns
(There's much more to voting here in switzerland and it's way more complex but just ask if you have questions)
>The last approved was the mass-imigration-initiative
Are you sure your copy of the Constitution is up to date ? Because there have been many amendments since 2014, such as art
88 about pedestrian and cycle paths which we voted on in 2018
I used [this] as source, but it is possible that there are other constitution changes we voted on which were proposed by the parliament
I missed the initiative about the bycicles because it was a direct counterproposal by the Federal Council, so it wasn't listed in my source
You're right
In german speaking switzerland wie pronounce it Eichhörnli, but the explanation is the same as with the german (from germany) one
Eichhörnli
Non-native speakers usually don't learn our dialect
It obviously shares the etymology of the standard German word
Ha, this is no match for the Swiss *Chuchichästli*
They claim to be neutral and treat it like the national religion and then go and sell weaponry to countries like Saudi-Arabia
Good job
Oh and some politicians are really scared of the EU taking over and wants as little treaties as possible which makes no sense
Our entire position against the EU ... I'm living directly beides the German border and would love to enjoy the freedom of travel as the Europeans
We can travel equally as easy but I feel the European spirit here in Switzerland but we're just not ready enough to join in :/
Selling weapons
same
Ah yes, selling weaponry to Arabic countries and then complaining about the refugies that are fleeing from the weapons you sold to this region
Not recognising Armenian genocide
Does Turkey run your country
> would love to enjoy the freedom of travel as the Europeans
how is your freedom of travel limited
We are supposed to be neutral since 1815 (treaty of Vienna)
Our country as we know it didn't even exist back then but it still applies because Switzerland signed it, just a different Switzerland
Just like a treaty that we made with Königreich Württemberg
I'm in university and it's way more trouble to make a semester in a European country than for Europeans ... I also like the European spirit of unity besides the many different languages and cultures
So you don't recognise it but you also don't deny it
You just don't talk about it or what
I agree with you on that one
Letting trains with whatever it might be just cross our country north to south or south to north and selling weaponry to everyone
However, you don't even have to go as far as WW2 for too much involvement
But South Sudan is a normal UN member state which is recognised by basically everyone so it's not that special
I know, i know that I didn't describe my point very good  and didn't know how to better describe it
But didn't want to delete the comment because there were alot of replys already :/
Migros v. Coop
They're both conglomerates that run a monopoly, but you pick a side and defend it to the death
-Team Coop
In Switzerland, I'd say the biggest battlefield (by far) are dialects
Is the linguistic variety from Zurich better than the one from Basel or is it the other way around
Is the dialect from Bern the prettiest or is it maybe the one from Thurgau
Also, by extension, Swiss people get very fired up about the use of anglicisms and especially germanisms in our "helvetic" language
For example there's a big fight going on about the issue of whether it is acceptable to use the plural "Männer" (men) for Maa (man) or whether that is a yucky evil German influence and we should all make a point of saying the proper "Mannä". This may seem like a triviality to you but remember, this is a country where almost everything else already works
so you might as well fight over language
Other big arguments exist over words such as "einkaufen" (shopping) instead of Swiss "poschtä", "seltsam/merkwürdig" (strange) instead of Swiss "struub", or "deshalb" (therefore) instead of Swiss "drum". Sometimes it's even just a small phonological transition that can make people lose their temper
For example some people now say "weil", "kaum" and "peinlich" instead of "proper" Swiss "wil", "chuum" and "piinlich", which others get enraged by
So yeah
this is the hill we all die on
Team both
Coop chind for life
Man, I hate that stuff
It's always "THURGAU/BASEL/(other canton you don't like) BAD XD" mixed with r/badlinguistics and unnecessary circlejerking about how only one's own dialect is the correct one (even though there's obviously no standard version of Swiss German)
Edit: Also, trying to celebrate Swiss German's linguistic diversity while still getting enraged about any (perceived) expression vom Germany you use
NO, FUCK YOU, SAYING "BUTTER" INSTEAD OF "ANKE" DOESN'T MEAN OUR LANGUAGE IS DYING (especially because that word has been part of many dialects for generations)
See, in Switzerland the debate would be about whether you should even spank yourself in a place where you're naked with other people, with any devices, birch or otherwise
[W. Nuss vo Bümplitz by Patent Ochsner is amazing for karaoke]
From Zürich I've taken direct trains to Hamburg, Paris, Vienna, Budapest (some of them night trains)
I've also used the train to get to Debrecen (via Budapest) and Brest (via Paris)
In my experience trains outside of Switzerland are unreliable af - especially Germany is terrible, France less so but still not good
I therefore only use international train connections when I don't have to keep to a fixed schedule, for the same reason I also try to not change train more than once outside of Switzerland (switching trains is just too much of a hassle if the schedule is unreliable)
In summary: If I'm on a fixed schedule I fly, not because I'm in a hurry but because the trains outside of Switzerland are unreliable
If I've got no fixed schedule I take the train because it doesn't matter
Mostly the overall duration of the trip
Will i be away for two weeks
Train it is
A weekend in Amsterdam
Plane
That is, unless the distance is prohibitive by train
I once had the complete opposite happening to me
I went to Tuscany and everything went perfect just until I entered Switzerland again
We waited in Chiasso for the customs service a really long time (they always wait but not this long) and thus were 10 minutes late
Later, we couldn't go through the Gotthard and had to go over it
An additional hour
We arrived at our destination about 80 minutes late
The only downside to that is it will be expensive af
Well our trains are pretty nice, especially compared to other countries, but we still tend to give it too much shit
No matter how good it gets, it's never good enough as you get used to the current standard
So it's good, it's expensive but we still mind too much
In the very rare cases where Switzerland appears in an international movie, it's usually mentioned in the context of a "secret bank account". This is a misrepresentation on two counts
Firstly, the banking secret actually doesn't exist anymore (certainly not for foreign citizens)
The times where dictators could hide their dark money in Swiss banks are gone
And secondly, I would argue that the banks are a rather bad representation of our country
They are predominantly located in one specific city and the vast majority of Swiss people neither works for a bank nor has made their money with the help of these banks
There isn't that many secret organisation headquarters in the Alpe
Yeas and no
Banks make up to 6% of our GDP
> The times where dictators could hide their dark money in Swiss banks are gone
Hmm
I would say it just got more difficult
I think there are always ways to invest in some shady company or something like this
No, that's the entire financial sector, which includes insurance business
The banking sector is just a fraction of that - the wealth management domain is even smaller
Something like this just a few weeks ago, if I recall correctly
But the guests were just trapped for a few hours before helicopters evacuated them
Everyone knows Portugal doesn't actually exist
- The 30 years war is the closest to what an actual period of total war looks like, could make for great RPG or strategy games
I wonder why there aren’t any yet
- the time around 1480 to 1520 between Charles-V of Spain and Francois 1er of France
Includes intrigues at court and war, great discoveries, a new world to conquer
- Of course the roman period, I would suggest the time of Caesar and Augustus, but the punic war is cool too
- the 100 year war
- the viking invasions between 782 and 1000
- the barbarian and mongol invasions
- the siege of Vienna
- the fall of constantinople
(Has mostly been done in Total war games)
Yeah I agree
Some TW games lack unit diversity because the region is too homogene, like in Shogun or Three kingdoms
In Switzerland we call the Germans "Schwobe" which originally referred to people from a specific region in Germany
And we call Italians "Tschingge" which is a bit more offensive and comes from the Italian word for five
Italians are 'Tschingge' (from 'cinque') and Germans are, depending on the dialect, 'Schwabe' or 'Schwobe'. This is because that's Swabians are the first Germans you will meet when going to Germany from Switzerland
We just named everyone in Germany after the Germans closest to us, which is something a lot of languages do
Otherwise, we're too busy calling each other names so we don't have time to give more names to our neighbours
Wait, how do you call cockroaches then
The rise of the NSDAP is coupled with the interwar chapters
The WW2 part actually covers the most important frontlines, though no battles in detail
We actually looked at the Swiss status during the war in entirely separate books/lessons
The holocaust is addressed in a separate part that follows WW2
German expulsions are also mentioned there but briefly
From my experience, chicken is obviously the most found poultry, but second place in nicer restaurant duck is second place
In cheaper places and in supermarkets, turkey is second place because it's quite cheap
You will then find 'Trutenschnitzel' sometimes as the schnitzel variety made from poultry
'Trutenschinken' (ham made from turkey) is also quite common
[Olten, the most beautiful hole in Switzerland
I couldnt find a single reply for Switzerland
The obvious answers would probably be Dietikon or Spreitenbach but i dont know if you can really count them since they only exist as part of a bigger agglomeration
If we only count single cities it gets really difficult
Maybe Winterthur or Chur
I dont wouldn't say it's ugly, but a lot of people have an intense dislike for Olten
The Kanti is really ugly tho, I still get war flashbacks from it
Was thinking Winterthur as well
In switzerland yes, but not in person, just online
Memepages have mocked my dialect a lot in the past
Jokes on you, at least we can speak high german without or just with a slight accent
Many swiss people from other cantons have pretty distinct and sometimes kinda harsh accents
A german linguistics prof at my uni once ‚judged‘ our accents in german and he said the same
In the US people seem to think our accent is cute
I was often asked where I‘m from, because I have ‚such a cute accent‘.
Nah I'm from around Basel, we have the most normal swiss german
Though I've met  drunk Graubündner guys who thought it was very funny to hear us say "Basler Leckerli"
Thats the first thing we do when we meet someone with another accent
We mock each others accent
So yes
"we have the most normal swiss german"
i‘m pretty sure that‘s what everyone says
the beautiful thing about swiss german is that every dialect has an aspect of it that you can make fun of
"we have the most normal swiss german" god I laughed so hard  pretty sure everybody thinks that about their dialect
Yes, but with us it's true :p jk I just say that because it's one of the more universally understandable dialects (compared to wallis for example)
Idk my friend, it's one of the dialects I've heard being joked about the most after Thurgauer and Walliser
The question isn't really about how understandable your dialect/accent is, but if people think it's funny
And Swiss people basically think every dialect but their own is either hilarious or just horrible
that‘s true
i‘d say the closer to germany, the more understandsble
We had 4 girls from Basel in out J+S course last year (i‘m from lucerene) and the rest of us was from lucerne and we laughed alot about the accents
But we kept it at a reasonable level, so that it wouldn‘t sound mean
When i talked about our „Corps“ one girl was happy that i also sang in my freetime because she understood „chor“
I‘m learning french (which also has the subjonctif)
I struggle so much, because I can never remember how to form it and when to use it
For exapmle you use the subjonctif after „Je ne pense pas que ...“ (I don‘t think ...)
Je ne pense pas qu‘il te comprenne
= I don‘t think he understands you
but you don‘t use it after „Je pense que“ (I think ...)
Je pense qu‘il te comprend
= I think he understands you
French speaking people: Correct me if I‘m wrong btw
Most companies
Yes
International Orgs (like the U.N)
Haha F off
AFAIK internships can only be unpaid if they have a "genuine educational aspect", meaning they include classes, coaching, exams etc
or are mandated and supervised by a school
The people in charge of such interns must also have some form of teaching or training licence (they must have the proper qualifications to train new people for whatever industry the internship is in)
IIRC there were even court cases where companies failed to provide "genuine educational aspects" had to retroactively pay their interns
So any internship that's purely for work experience (eg
The classical go get coffee internship) must be paid
It’s funny because I expected New York to be entirely made out of modern glass skyscrapers but instead most of them are tall stone facade buildings like the empire state building
Not a movie but the (very problematic but oh well) netflix show/book adaptation of  „Thirteen Reasons Why“ was translated to „Tote Mädchen lügen nicht“ which means „dead girls don‘t lie“
they changed the title "zootopia" into "zoomania" in the german version
why
it's still english, so why even change anything
Edit: the change also removes the word play
We call it „Vergiss mein nicht“ which is „Forget me not“ which is a little blue flower so it at least has some very basic play on words but the beauty of that title is still lost
Oh god that is even worse
Well, yea
The entire thing is pretty disturbing imo
I actually really like it, but mainly because I also really like that poem
No, luckily not
Definitly "W Nuss vo Bümpliz" from Patent Ochsner
That song is a goddamn bop and noone can tell me otherwise
There's nothing to feel guilty about with this one, truly a masterpiece
Also, the Scots in a Karaoke bar on Lanzarote seemed to like it as well
How is this one a guilty pleasure
Because it is to me
Nobody i know would listen to it
This is a normal window where I live, unless one lives in a very old home

AskSwitzerland is the best and only Swiss YouTuber I know
Le Grand JD
The only Swiss youtuber I watch is easyvote
lionel battegay/Ask Switzerland
He's making street interviews in swiss german, he's awesome :)
In the french part of Switzerland we have "Le Grand JD". He has been, among other things, to Irak to show how the war really was out there
In addition to him and more surprisingly there is our national television who posts short films and fictions which are pretty great IMO
Melonpan lol
TIL Kurzgesagt is based in Munich, for some reason thought they only took Kurzgesagt for a catchy tone
I don't think there are many swiss YouTubers tbh
I really like Le Grand JD, he’s pretty popular among french speakers I think
They *began* with the English channel
The German one came later, just FYI if you didn't know
There are a few but not many
For most YouTube is just something they do extra
omg I know this dude lmao the swissmeme page use to post him a lot haha didn't know he had a youtube channel
"Ja liebe Honigkuchenpferde" haha
How can you tell
I just scrolled through his channel, everything's in English
Just curious
Very common, I always shake hands with men I don't know yet
Not quite with close friends tho, we just dap up
It is very common, though there are variations between formal handshakes, informal handshakes and even handshakes with hugs
With friends and acquaintances, we do informal handshakes or the handshake into a hug
With women it's a formal handshake or three kisses, or a close hug when you are really close
**Personal:** Cats
although, I'm not much into pets
**National:** It's probably around 50:50
There are lots of people who like dogs but there are also lots of people who prefer cats
**Continent:** I think this depends on the region
In Southern Europe and the Balkans it's probably dogs, the more north you go probably a preference for cats
Eastern Europe
I don't know very much about this region but my guess would be dogs
I'm deliberately writing this before looking at any of the other answers ;-)
I'm a cat person, despite being allergic to them but not to dogs
I can't really say for my country or continent, but I know that cats are actually quite a pest and a danger to the small bird populations around here, sadly
I still can't help but love them
There's a religion in northern India called Jainism
I believe it's a sub-religion of Buddhism
One of their main tenets is non-violence and Jain monks go as far as sweeping the ground in front of them when they go for a walk to avoid stepping on any bugs
You just reminded me of them ;-)
Rumansh, which is considered a romance language and spoken in parts of Graubünden
Also I think eventhough people know about swiss german, I doubt anyone actually knows about the specific dialects we speak, like how different Bärndütsch and Baslerditsch sound
There is a language called Rätoromanisch in Switzerland but only very few people speak it
Rumantsch always sounded super weird to me
It's like a mish-mash of 6 different romanic languages all morphed into each other
Hahaha absolutely
But I love listening to weird languages so I enjoy this little one
As a french speaker believe me most of us can’t tell the difference either
Can you actually immediately tell if someone is French or Swiss by the a cent
Like for the love of God I couldn't tell them appart unless they say some very specific words I know only Swiss say :'D
Some people have a very strong accent so it’s pretty obvious to me, I can also often tell from which region of the Romandie they’re from
But today the accents are getting a bit lost, mostly in the cities where you’ll find most Swiss speak in a more generic french accent
So I often can’t tell right away, until they talk more and I pay attention to it

No, not reliant on having car, but it makes life a lot easier
I'm reliant of a car because I hate being dependent to public transportation
Have to look up for hours and coincidences and have to deal with delays makes me mad
I love the freedom a car gives you
I use public transportation all the time
It takes me 40 minutes to get to school but I have a zvv card for all of Zurich so I can go where I like
Not at all
I'm 18 years old and since I live in Zurich, I'm not planning to get a driver's license in the near future
Driving in Zurich really isn't nice, cycling is better but also not great so public transport it is, which is pretty great, especially for a city this size
And for trips outside of the city I can use public transport as well, there are trains every 30 minutes between major cities, suburban trains run every 30 minutes as well in Zurich, in other cities either every 30 or 60 minutes
There even are hourly trains on many rural lines and if there's no trains there's probably a bus that depending on how rural it is either runs hourly or just a few times a day
For the locals, these aren't really an alternative to the car because some only run a few times a day and those which do run hourly often stop quite early in the evening
Well you guys have our old trams now
Meanwhile, we've opened a few new lines and now don't have enough trams because the old ones are in Ukraine and the new ones aren't here yet
We finally got a car after living here for almost 7 years without one
We use it so infrequently that we sometimes have to remember just where we parked it (street parking only)
I'm still not sure if it was a worthwhile purchase, but its been done, so
Meanwhile, I have a 10 minute bicycle commute to work, and the bus/tram stops are within two blocks of the apartment
Why would you even try to drive there
You’re not allowed to mow your lawn on Sunday
But knowing our love for peace and quiet, I can easily imagine someone calling the police on you if you do
iirc they don't give an extra charge in the US if you escape before you were sentenced to prison or arrived in prison because of the natural need of a normal person for freedom, or something
*Time for a holy crusade I'd say*
Similar situation in Switzerland
Regarding grey area downloading and streaming, it is important to note that there are many shows which you cannot watch legally either, no matter how much you are willing to pay
Amazon Prime doesn't have a lot of the content here, and neither does Netflix
So Bulgaria is Japan in hardcore mode
They "just" have to censor their porn, iirc
We *really* love our peace and quiet
Neighbors have a loud car because of a special exhaust pipe (I don't remember what type), got the police called on them, couldn't do anything (sadly) because the exhaust pipe gets measured a certain way and in that way it's on normal decibel levels
iirc downloading is fully legal, contributing it is illegal
Might have it wrong in my head though
I'd say Belgrad because it was (maybe even still is idk) the capitol of the country that once dominated the Balkans (Yugoslavia) or maybe even still does (Serbia)
A few years back there was some construction work in the middle of the city in front of the opera house in Zürich
During those construction work they found remains of a pile dweller settlement, dated from around 3000 BC
These findings included the second oldest [door] of the world (the oldest one being found in another place in Zürich), kids clothing, pots etc
In another place in Zürich, many years back, also during construction works an old Roman bath was found
In the city: ticket machine, pay with coins or card, ticket machines at train stations also accept bank notes
In some areas they also have ticket machines in the vehicles
Trains: ticket machine or ticket office if there is one
Suburban and rural bus route: if there is no ticket machine at the stop or in the bus, you can buy a ticket from the driver
You can also use apps to buy your tickets
You can either buy normal tickets or use this service that tracks you on your route and then charges you at the end of the day
Since a few days I got the option to travel with activated gps
The app is linked to my credit card and the cost for the travel is being charged automatically
I personally don't use it for privacy reasons, I prefer to buy the ticket via app manually before boarding the train/bus
Many ways: cash or cards at the vending machine, using the app to buy a ticket, or use the checkin-checkout feature of the app with the appropriate ticket bought automatically by the app
But most people using public transport regularly have some sort of yearly ticket allowing them to use it whenever they want and as much as they want
I just buy a public transport card which I can use for a year instead of buying a ticket every day
costs about 1
2k for one year
Price depends on how many zones you want to travel
We don't pay by time but by distance/zones

I said I'm from Switzerland and they said: "Ahhh
Schoki, Schoki" (short word for Chocolate in the way Germans think Swiss-Germans say it)
I cringed really hard
How hot does it get
I always thought about moving to Norway to escape our hot summers (30C but very dry)
It is quite shocking how many people don't realize that those are not the same countries
I personally don't have that problem but once was fooled by the accident and thought it was a Scottish or even British accent, leading to the question "where from the UK are your from
" - I've learned from that mistake and will phrase the question differently, but I'm still having a hard time picking up the different accents in English language
With that said, if I say I'm American or <Latin American country>, I get a lot of "but where are you really from
" here in Europe, hence my opening statement in the comment above
So let's add that to the list as well
Same thing
I am German and never learned to speak the Swiss dialect
But tbh while I see how it can get annoying for some people, I have encountered this so often and not a single time was it meant in a negative way
They were just curious
So I'm not really bothered and just tell them where I'm born / where my parents are from, but how it doesn't really matter because I grew up in Zurich
Then they also usually realize that I don't have a lot more knowledge about Germany than they do
These news are already a few months old but whatever
In the cantonal parliament of Zurich (Kantonsrat), there are now (since the elections happened on the 24th of March) more members of our country's two green parties and there is one of the seven members of our Regierungsrat (cantonal government) is someone from the Green Party as well

The Gotthard base tunnel is the longest railway tunnel in the world with 57 km
The one you drive isn't the record breaking one though, it's only approx 15km I believe
Quite scary experience still
You might be right with the 17, haven't looked it up ;)
The no end in sight is indeed a strange feeling, especially if it persists so long
But what really messes with me is the fact that it's the highway but it's a single lane and no center divider (which never exists outside of tunnels here
This just makes it more claustrophobic for me somehow and seems way more dangerous
I seldom eat potatoes so besides gnocchi once a year I probably won’t miss it
I'd eat bread, rice, quinoa and pasta in place of potatoes, probably
But I'd be sad, so many delicious dishes wouldn't exist without potatoes
Rösti and Raclette won't work without potates
The authorities have been informed, your licence to bünzli will be revoked

Some ice hockey clubs have a similar fan "culture" (afaik not all)
But football is definitely more in the news about this issue
Same in Switzerland
Afaik it's more like a fair
But I've never been to a schwingen tournament and probably never will
You didn't butchered it
The 100% correct word would be the "Eidgenössische Schwingfest" or just the "Eidgenössische". The "king" comes from the title
The winner of the Eidgenössische becomes the "Schwingkönig" (King of the Schwinger)
I grew up on the countryside
I definitely know what you mean with rowdier
Fun fact: In my Rugby Club we once had a guy who was a Schwinger when he was a child
God I hated to go in contact against him
Even thought he didn't used the technique (at least afaik) he always brought me down without any problems (And I was 20kg+ heavier than him)
Never tried to Schwing
But I don't like the over the top Swissness of Schwingfests anyway
The Winner of the Eidgenössische gets bull
Or a money equivalent if he don't like the bull
In smaller Schwingfest they get maybe bells
We would be desperately trying to get along with everyone by staying neutral about everything
For example if Russia was stabbing Ukraine under the table we'd just say "please be nice to each other my friends", even if Russia was doing most of the aggression
After all, we want to be friends with everyone, including Russia
At the same time, however, we would awkwardly keep to ourselves whenever someone suggested some group activity
For example: Germany: "Does anyone want to play a fun drinking game
" Everyone: "Yeeeaaah
" Switzerland: "Ehh, sounds weird, we'll just watch you from the corner over there
We'd also try to make up rules for everything to make this evening more structured and orderly
For example: "Nobody is allowed to drink alcohol before 6pm and after 11pm" or "No music after 10pm because we'll bother the neighbors" or "petting the cat is forbidden" or "smoking is only allowed on the balcony and only in the specific area that we previously marked on the floor with duct tape" or "you only get a second serving if you order your empty beer bottles according to their color, so it's easier to recycle them later
I'm hurt
Maybe I just had bad teachers, but we were never taught anything about the history of Switzerland
At all
Only in my last year of highschool did we talk about our country during ww1 and ww2, which really isn’t the most eventful subject
Once in University I learned about how Switzerland came to be, the wars between cantons, it’s relations with other countries, etc
But most importantly I wish we would have been taught the history of the swiss neutrality
I find it really interesting and can’t understand why it’s not more talked about given that it is such a big part of our national identity
That Rolex watches are made from Chinese/foreign components and then assembled in Switzerland to qualify for the Swiss made label
In r/soccer
Same for r/switzerland aswell
One of the Free Talk Fridays
But I've had similar conversations on the same topic on this subreddit as well
I‘m sorry but that Texas German sounds like plain old German with an English accent, why would you say that it sounds nothing like any German dialect
Well, there's the global celebrity scandal wherein a famous director who is also a fugitive of the U.S. criminal justice system was invited to a film festival and promptly arrested at the airport
Then there's the more regional celebrity scandal of a weatherman whose ex-girlfriend accused him of rape which led to - you guessed it - his arrest at an airport
And a rather lengthy and unsatisfactory* trial, of course
In short: Swiss celebrity scandals really like an airport showdown
*Edit: I had misremembered the trial as unsatisfactory and stand corrected
There was a definite conclusion
I think it was the media circus around the procedures that left me with a bad aftertaste
Wow this is dark
Cool
Thanks
Honestly, I remember mainly that there was a lot of to and fro, including in the civil case(s?)
There were some halfway-between-the-sides decisions; I just never felt like there was a conclusion, really
Idk but once I understood what Migraine, Ride and (to an extent) Stressed Out are about I was kinda shocked I guess

We learned about the holy roman emperor but I've never heard of the other thing you mentioned
How is that part of our history
Also it definitely wasn’t taught to me
Im sorry, I thought the question was just about things in general you learn at school
How to apply, deadlines, rights and obligations as a tenant, how much of your salary it should cost and those kind of things
but it's still helpfull to know if the landlord isn't doing what he's supposed to, and what I can do about it
It was banned at the federal level in 1938 by public referendum, and took effect in 1942, although for military convictions it was still possible until 1992 for treason
We banned it once before when revising the constitution in 1874, but this was revoked after a few years at the federal level
Some individual cantons kept the ban
Depends who you ask
Politicians - especially conservative ones - like to be very welcoming to expats regardless of where those expats are from because *money money money money*.
Regular people tend to be less enamored with expats because many of them don't bother to integrate themselves even a tiny little bit (a lot of them don't know a single word of German, even after years of living here)
Many also act very inappropriately because they don't know about Swiss customs and mentality (because they don't bother to learn about it)
Sadly, there's a very nasty double-standard in Switzerland and - arguably - in many other European countries too
If you're a poor immigrant, only the harshest of laws are good enough
You need to jump through hoops of fire just to get a job or learn the local language
You are constantly scrutinized and approached with a dose of xenophobia
The authorities will try anything they can to kick you out of the country again
But if you're a banking CEO for instance, the politicians will roll out the red carpet for you
Despite the fact that being a banker is probably the most unproductive job in the world and contributes far less to society than some poor immigrant who cleans toilets
Would be nice if it was like that
Apart from that, May 1 is not a holiday throughout the country
Holidays are not transferable in first hand
And in addition: 1st of May isn't a national holiday
In mainly catholic cantons 1st of November is a holiday instead of 1st of May
I take a shower a day after my morning exercise
If I am doing something that gets me hot and sweaty during the day, I will take another
I don't usually take baths and cannot recall the last one
I shower daily, sometimes every two days when I have no time
when I lived in Japan, I used to take a bath every day but here in Switzerland, I don't bathe at home at all
I have a pizza cutter
I've never heard of anyone cutting pizza with scissors, but I honestly can't say what people do in their kitchens, only that I have not seen it
I use a Swiss Army knife of course
Sometimes a CNC machine or chainsaw
Seriously though it's a pizza cutter
But will try a scissor next time
My mom alway cut them with scissors

You might want to check out Eluveitie
They're actually better known in other countries than Switzerland
It's celtic-folk-metal
They often sing in Celtic
There's a Swiss German song called "De Ruef vo de Bärge".
From St
Gallen in the very east of Switzerland: [Knöppel - Prada] Goold old punk, even though the album is from 2016
&#x200B;
From your list:
*  Native language -> Tough German dialect from St
Gallen (different to standard German)
* National Instrument -> No
* Distinctive elements about the country: It's a rant against [this style] So as it's a rich style it could somehow count as yes
If you want and/or need a translation, I can do one for you
There is barely one and the original lyrics is written in dialect too, so you can't translate it with google
Eluveitie -Slania's song ( sung in Gaelic+ various folk instrument) or Inis Mona
I find it important that they help to reconstruct the old language to preserve it
E: want to add to possible entries: Tegernako, Your gaulish war, Uis elveti, omnos, Epona or Rebirth
Look up Eluveitie and Gotthard, they are the two most well known Swiss bands
I find Tegernako and your Gaulish war to be severly underrated
I saw them live when they were at a really small open air in my neighbouring village
Their studio is near there, so they agreed to play for like 100 spectators max
It was very cool
Indeed
Considering it's the same city, it's probably the actual intention
Oh your right . The dumb new Spotify UI just didn't show me the entire discography
I don't know whether it's exceptionally famous, but the European Court of ~~Justice~~ Human Rights recently declared the ban on begging in Switzerland to be a violation of human rights
I found it exciting when I heard about it, and as far as I know there was also a political outcry
As far as I know it's still banned (at least in most places)
And yes, there are fines
Not sure if the court ruling will really be enforced
The reason for the ban is that no-one who (legally) lives in Switzerland is forced to beg, as everyone can make use of the benefits of the social system
Additionally, it's a question of public safety (e.g. prevention of organized begging gangs) and urban image
Incidentally, begging means asking for money in public without any 'service in return': making music or making art is allowed if the city rules are complied with (e.g. no longer than 15 minutes in the same location), but sitting on the ground with a paper cup is not allowed
While some cities don't have beggars without a begging ban, it doesn't seem to work in others
So there certainly seems to be other/better alternatives than bans
Many people fear, however, that the cities in the future could look like, for example, in Germany at the moment
Zurich in particular has trauma from people sitting/lying around in the city center
Everybody definitely want to prevent that
> Various studies show that is social welfare that helps the poor
Most of these beggers aren't locals
I'm not sure they would get any social welfare anyway
> Is it true that welfare is required to be paid back in Switzerland
Yes if you're able
As someone living in Zürich: This is probably the biggest problem
Most beggars are simply people who came for a job or something else and don't really have the legal rights to be here and receive welfare payments if it doesn't work out
I've had many people come up to me just asking for money for a train ticket back home
You need to be able to pay without running into financial problems
It sounds a lot more harsh than it really is
The last thing the government wants is to push people back into the situation they were before where they rely on the state to take care of them
Yeah I thought it was a scam too sometimes but I'm a gullible guy when it comes to helping people \^\^ If he needs to lie to me to get a little bit of money I'm pretty sure he needs it more than me
Thanks for the heads up though
In my dialects, we just say "Danke". But I believe that there are some other dialects where the personal pronoun (in the dative case) is always attached and changes if you thank several people
This is different from your example, because the form changes with the number of people receiving the thanks, not the number of people thanking
The whole language minus some words we loaned from french and italian
I actually am one of those "men with long hair", lol
Here it's not really that common, but it's pretty much accepted
I have long hair and I don't feel like I get an abnormal amount of looks
a lot of people here are following the kind of top knot/manbun trend at the moment so it's not uncommon at all
when I lived in Japan it was a whole other story, I probably was the only blonde, long haired man in a 5km radius
In Switzerland it's rather outdated, it's kind of 1977
Guess, most people will view them as a pretty curiosity and a memento on bygone times
Also, "Bella ciao"
Say that we’re not really neutral, or that neutrality is not a good thing
To be fair, the misunderstanding is a little more understandable in other languages
Spanish

You know I’ve never heard a french speaking person get it wrong, so I’m not sure about this one
Fair enough, although I feel like the confusion in English stems often from the distinction between Swiss and Swedes, which I’ll admit sounds quite similar

What's Spanish
I understand a bit of Castellano, if that's what you mean, mainly because I speak French quite well
I know, I was being an annoying smartrarse
It just seems
not very nice to call one of the languages of Spain spanish, as if the others were lesser than Castellano for some reason
In Switzerland all four languages are equal, and to call one of them the Swiss language would be discriminating
Maybe you'd have less of a mess with separatist regions if you treated them more like equals
Why would Latin America be annoyed if the language were called Castilian
I don't hear the Irish or the Canadians complain about English being called English
Intact castles (usually museums nowadays): 20ish
It never occurred to be that that's a stat to keep track of
Ruins (aka
piles of rubble, which when viewed from the air look suspiciously like the outlines of a castle, and where archeologists have dug up some stuff) countless, they are basically on every more or less prominent hill
I could not tell you  even if I wanted to, there’s just so many
And my parents have been taking me to castles since I was a baby, so there’s many more I don’t remember

Does not compute
The discovery of the iron age Pfahlbauer at Swiss lakesides in mid 19th century
The modern Swiss state was founded then and they were desperately looking for historical ancestors to build their nationality on but didn't find anything they really liked
Then these Pfahlbauten were found
These were traces of iron age buildings built on wooden posts at lakesides
The politicians interpreted it as traces of a peaceful small people living neutrally on the lakes on their built islands while there was war going on on the land around them, just like they wanted to present Switzerland to the world
(Archaeologists nowadays know a lot more about Pfahlbauten and have rejected this romantic interpretation
Fondue
Cheese fondue
Or Raclette
Or any smelly cheese meal, really
I can‘t help myself, the stench of cheese makes me want to throw up

Or is it meant as the second last right turn before the stop sign appears
On case 1, understandable
case 2, wtf
And the broken fence is great for saving time tbh, so you won't drive 15 minutes without noticing, for example
But then again, is the fence they're talking about still broken
Some Swiss do it too
it‘s not a must in all situations though
One time at my old high school a kid dropped a plate in the cafeteria
All 400~ students there started clapping
It was the beginning of the school year and no one dropped things after that lol
We have "Schmutzli" in Switzerland which is quite similair
Yeah thats the stereotype in Switzerland aswell
But this is where it gets weird
You guys are already spending more on healthcare (per capita) than [any other western country]
Lists are with public and private spending, although it's a 50/50 split in the US' case
So instead of spending it privately, you could already use it publicly instead, while also putting laws up to stop the overpricing of medical services like it is currently done
The thing with quality is about the government saving money on healthcare, which must be regulated that it doesn't happen, or not to a severe magnitude
**Make your goverment take care of it's citizens**
Not really that fundamental but if you can't cook basic dishes it's seen as a bit immature
I can't cook for shit and i'm honestly ashamed
I envy people who grew up with culinary knowledge from their family – Never really had great cooks in my family so I'm extremely amateurish in cooking proper dishes
I should maybe just buy a recipe book
Yeah, same here
Also baking is just a basic skill you should have before 18
Seems like a good approach, thanks :)
For most Swiss people, wages have indeed caught up with the high prices
Just to give you a vague idea: the median income per month in Switzerland is 6,500 CHF (8,670 Canadian Dollars)
If you only take Zurich, which is the most prosperous area in Switzerland, the median income per month shoots up to 7,500 CHF (10,000 Canadian Dollars)
This is, despite the fact that we pay a lot for food, clothing, insurance and many other things, still a good amount of money to live a comfortable life
Naturally, your personal situation also plays a role
If you have children, it's harder to make ends meet than if you don't. Couples without children have it the most comfortable
Again, just to give you an idea: one of my close friends that I know since high school works as a high school teacher
In Switzerland, this is a job with a high academic qualification threshold but it's also a well-respected job
Consequently, it pays well
My friend probably makes somewhere around 12,000 Canadian Dollars a month
His fiancé has a masters in psychology and probably earns pretty well too
maybe like 10,000 CAD a month
They don't have kids
So, this means together they make around 22,000 CAD every month
Even after taxes, insurance, rent and all the other high living expenses, this is enough money to go on nice vacation 3-4 times a year or save for your own house
Now, this may all sound very fine and dandy but there is a big caveat here
The truth is that, while most people in Switzerland are doing good, poor people are struggling particularly hard
I know this from personal experience because I'm on social benefits due to a lifelong physical disability
There are several reasons why life for poor people in Switzerland is very tough
For starters, our welfare system leaves room for improvement
Secondly, when you are on social benefits or you happen to be in a job that pays really crappy, all these things that you need or want seem unaffordable
Even just a single trip to the supermarket might feel scary because things are just so expensive for you
The worst part about being poor in Switzerland, however, has to do with human psychology
In a country where you are surrounded by well-off people, barely scraping by REALLY sucks
I often say that being poor in a rich country is even worse than being poor in a poor country
If I'm a poor guy in, say, Cambodia, there's at least a good chance that I'll be surrounded by many other folks who are in the exact same situation
This makes me feel protected and like I'm a part of a community
Of course it's still not nice to live in a shed but I've got all these friends and together we can help each other because we all know what it's like
In Switzerland, poor people feel extremely isolated from the rest of society
When I look at my friends, I see all these people who go on fancy vacations, buy themselves all sorts of electronic gadgets, live in big apartments etc
They tell me they understand me but I don't believe they truly do
Our lives are simply too different
It's hard not to feel envious or bitter when you're in this situation because it feels like the rest of society has left you behind
Ironically, because the Swiss model works so amazing for such a large part of the population, it is especially painful for those individuals where who don't get a piece of the pie (for whatever reason that may be)
Wages compensate the COL, but the big caveat no one talks about compared to (say) the U.S is that you don't get to save as much money
In 5 years living/working in the U.S (NYC metro), I saved about 2
5X what I have in Switzerland (Geneva) despite earning 60% more (also 5 years)
> even weekend work
Swiss labour laws are generally quite lax, but that sounds more like your friends got taken advantage of
Expected to work weekends, without being granted advantages elsewhere, is more something that can happen when you reach very high Swiss salaries
Otherwise, it could represent a breach of a sectorial collective bargaining agreement
Most Swiss work 40-42 hours per week
The limit is 45h by law
I made out with a girl i just met while motley crue were playing kickstart my heart in concert
In Austria
None
Other regions joining us is more likely than any secession movement getting any traction
The only secession movement we had was french speaking Berne
They still wanted to be part of Switzerland tough, just as an independent Canton and not part of Canton Berne
Thats how Canton Jura became our 26th Canton in 1979
"population movements" is a nice way to put it
The occasional Genevian wanders by sometimes
Jokes aside, we have plenty of wild animals, deer, fox, boar, mountain goats, hedgehogs, etc
that wander around
Plenty of "farm cats" which are technically stray I guess, but we don't consider them that way since they also technically have a home on a farm
So I guess my answer would be no, we have no strays and so they aren't a problem
It is pretty much a kid only event here, unless the parents of a kid might be a godparent or relative, and even then, it is still weird to stay for long
Maybe grandparents might be there helping the parents a bit
By the time my kids were in school (age 6 or so) we would just send them on public transport alone to the party if they knew the place
No, we don't. The higher you go in education you'll meet people from wider and wider regions which kind of teaches you more and more dialects just by communicating
At first it's only minor differences but the further you go the more extreme it gets
After military service, where you meet people from all over the country at once, you'll finally get the big picture of it
Think it's mostly due to that I'm able to  pinpoint which region someone grew up in, usually even in which part of a canton
Porchetta sandwich in Rosetta bread
My favorite sandwiches ever
**"Lampredotto/Panino con Bollito w/spicy sauce" : Da Nerbone (Mercato Centrale), Florence Italy**. It's insane how good it is for something so seemingly simple
An absolutely MUST TRY in my opinion
**"Cheesesteak wiz wit" : Pat's King of Steaks, Philadelphia PA USA**. I've had just about every steak in the city
There's something about Pats that just does IT for me
Probably mostly nostalgia, nothing wrong with that
**"The Fat Bitch with Hot sauce" : Grease Trucks @ Rutgers University, New Brunswick NJ USA
** When you shove a cheesesteak, mozzarella sticks, chicken fingers, fries, mayo, ketuchup, lettuce, tomato and hot sauce in one sandwich you get magic
Drunken greasy magic
But magic
**"Butifarra" : La Lucha, Lima Peru
** Italians brought this recipe to Catalonia who then took it to the new world and the natives modified it with local ingredients
It's an explosion of interesting flavors true to Peruvian cuisine

Good to hear that :)
How the fuck does the far right care more, it just came out that they basically planed to sell the country to Russia .
Switzerland, can't tell why tho
I choose Switzerland because I have been here all my life and like it
First we ge a room and kissing costs extra
Switzerland
because that's where I grew up and I love it
And for the chocolate
Also less unemployment than German (don't know about Austria)
&#x200B;
I think I would like it in all 3 of them, though
I have lived in all three and I’d pick Switzerland for the beautiful mountains, quality of life, public transportation and the political system
Although Vienna and Berlin are more fun to live in
Switzerland of course
But if I had to choose it would be Germany because  Austria is too similar to Switzerland
Wish fulfilled
You live in the Romansh speaking part of Switzerland
Oh wait, this ain't r/TheMonkeyspaw
I don't know what's up with the hate thing
I have no issues with Germans at all, that's just old, conservative people who have that
However, if you move here, we do expect you to get used to Swiss German after a while
If you are in a group of Swiss people, they don't want to have to speak standard German just because of one person
Btw I would probably also choose Wien but Zürich is nice too so it's kinda hard
Lugano is getting international finally, after years of being a place without NOTHING to do for fun
I would have expected more people to use this argument
You guys just need to see the salaries and taxes here and you would choose Switzerland in the blink of an eye
Why not interested ?
Same, just the other way around :)
Lol, please explain
I wanna know
Why
It is, at least in my opinion
We did extensive studies and have assurance that we’re fun
The fudge
Yeah it's expensive but at the end of the day, the average worker definitely has more money leftover after all expenses are paid
That's also why moving to another country as a Swiss person usually kinda sucks financially
unless you don't plan on returning
Yes, but your purchasing power is still higher
A chum, isch doch käs problem
Wait
So, North Korea is not in the news in Denmark
How
Vo Chäs het da gar niemert gredt ihr knödelfrässer
If you have an abonnement it's decently affordable - but for single trips it's extremely expensive
The whole system is geared for commuters and abonnements (which are mainly used by commuters) are heavily subsidized, single trips are not
Yes, that's basically the way it is
Either you use public transport regularly and have a yearly or monthly pass (whether that's one just for your region or for all of Switzerland depends on where you have to travel regularly)
These passes (abonnements) are not cheap but easily worth it even if you only use public transport once or twice a week
If you don't use public transportat often enough to justify buying a pass you'll never use it because it's just so damn expensive
All the time
Nothing is concentrated in a single city
The highest criminal court, the highest civil court and the seat of government are all in different cities, for example
It's part of us being a federation of somewhat independent cantons, not a centralised state like France
I mean officially we don't even have a capital, Bern is just the de facto capital because welp
the damn building has to be some where
Not really no, the federal assembly and the federal council are in Bern and the federal tribunal is in Lausanne
Switzerland is a very decentralized country
Officially we don't, but if the Zürchers ask then it's Bern
They love to hear that

Maybe I would see it differently now, but when I was 15 I thought it was quite awful
Our teacher made the mistake of reading Hermann Hesse's "Der Steppenwolf" as the first book in "high school" (Gymnasium)
We were 15/16
i loved Faust I. as for Faust II my teacher was like "oh we‘re not gonna bother with part II, it‘s too long and not that interesting, you can read that on your own if you really want to"
That's gonna confuse the shit out of computer science people where "nonce" is a number or string only used once
Most often used in cryptographic contexts
It didn't fall out of use, it's simply the only word for "honour". Rather, the concept itself was regarded as somewhat unmodern
The French don't always carry a baguette around with them and the Germans aren't angry but actually very nice people
There are angry people of course, but not more than in other places
Pro gun Americans know nothing of Switzerland
I say that as a Swiss gun owner
Their fantasy view of Switzerland is incorrect, and our system only works with respect, a sense of community and the greater good, strict regulations and oversight, and a social network well beyond what America has
I am annoyed they use us as an example all the time
We have the Eu directive with exemptions now, anyway, so I hope it ends
To be clear, the attitude towards guns here is diverse and complex, so it isn't some sort of gun utopia
Many Swiss dislike guns, some see them as a necessary thing, and some like them, so we are not a homogeneous group
None of us want anything like the shit storm of America
I really know fuck all about US gun laws but I can tell you one thing:
If we ever (god forbid) have anything close to what happened in the US in the past few days, things would just change
Fast
We had one soldier nutcase randomly shoot a girl at a bus station which led to all soldiers having to hand back the government issued ammo (sealed box of ammo stored at home in case of war)
We're very pragmatic in this regard
Your right to shiny toys ends when people lose their lives
>hey believe banning guns will only leave it to the hands of the 'bad' guys
Well
Are they wrong
Criminals, by definition, got the name by breaking the law
They won't just suddenly lose all interest in firearms just because some new law passed and given that American homes are overflowing with guns, they'll be able to keep themselves stocked up easily by grabing those (which is already where a large part of the crime guns come from - gangs killing eachother with stolen firearms)
>And also it will not be able to remove guns from the public
They've got a point given the unique situation they're in
* The US already has many guns around (the last figure estimate I heard was 400-450 million)
* Private sales often don't require a paper trail depending on different state laws, so for all intents and purposes those weapons are "unregistered". ("What, you mean that gun I own according to that 4473 form
Sold that one 2 years ago, privately for cash
No receipt and I forgot the name, sorry
* The way they define a firearm legally (for example, only the lower receiver of an AR15, or the grip of a handgun are the actual "firearms" - the barrels, uppers, slides and everything else aren't serialized and freely available)
* You can produce [your own (unserialized) versions] of those regulated parts as long as your primary intention wasn't to sell them (a.k.a. oops, I made a bunch of guns and *somebody* stole them)
The thing is, those 400 million won't just disappear once you outlaw them and short of going house to house for confiscation (which will *definitely* lead to a lot of bloodshed) they don't have a way to check or keep track of them either
Guns also don't have a shelf life so even if you'd ban *everything new starting now*, the ones already out there would last a century or two easily
For comparison: people are [still shooting pre-WW1 era guns that are 140 years old by now]
>Do you believe the Swiss model where so many people own guns yet has rare occurrences of mass shootings, is feasible in rest of Europe, and America
Our gun laws aren't the reason why we don't shoot eachother often, in fact they're more loose than what a lot of US states currently have
For example: all handguns and semiautomatic rifles are covered under the same shall-issue permit / we can purchase and own select-fire weapons / the army hands you one to take home with you if you're in a function that gets a Sig 550
We have a more culturally homogenous society, better social security nets, we actually lock our dangerous mental cases away etc
and our gun culture *generally* revolves around competition or protecting the collective (e.g. as part of the citizen militia/army), while in the US it revolves around self-protection and as an intended failsafe against government
They don’t know anything about Swiss laws
Anyone that has a military issued weapon in Switzerland is part of the army and has gone through extensive training, background check and all
It is illegal to use it or carry the gun unless you are on your way to the military service
If you use it at home for self defense (home invasion or anything else) you are not allowed to use that weapon and you will be found guilty of inappropriate use of force
I don't think comparing wildly different countries makes much sense and I've never heard someone argue a **ban** would be useful
There's a big difference between a ban and stricter regulations
In my opinion, the gun ownership rate is not an issue per se
The quality of gun ownership is
A good system needs to make sure every gun owner is reasonably trained and has no criminal record, no history of violence, addiction, or mental health issues
The Swiss system does that
Then there's the gun owner's attitude
That's cultural and needs to be addressed as such, no law can improve it
Swiss gun owners, generally speaking, don't feel threatened and don't walk around armed
Last one in my hometown in 2001
>infinitely more strict than (the average) American gun laws
I would disagree on that: the main difference is carry laws which are lax in the US while in Switzerland basically only LEOs can carry
What kind of merits do you see
>has gone through extensive training
Hahaha
>It is illegal to use it or carry the gun unless you are on your way to the military service
Except it's not
>If you use it at home for self defense (home invasion or anything else) you are not allowed to use that weapon and you will be found guilty of inappropriate use of force
You can, just not in most cases
It also depends on mitigating circumstances
>A good system needs to make sure every gun owner is reasonably trained and has no criminal record, no history of violence, addiction, or mental health issues
The Swiss system does that
Our system doesn't do that mate
>good system needs to make sure every gun owner is reasonably trained
Please explain to me how the Swiss system does that
>where citizens are issued with an assault rifle which they effectively keep at home (with ammo)
Ammo isn't supplied anymore to soldiers since 2008
You can also choose wether to have a rifle/handgun or not and store it in arsenals instead of your home
Also unlike what everyone is thinking, military service is actually not mandatory
What's mandatory is the conscription during which you decide if you want to do the army
Except they're not good and full of shit on our legislation
They are mostly based around soldiers keeping their weapons at home and keeping them ( in a deactivated semi-automatic only version) permanently after service
This concept of an armed civilian populace has been a tradition for hundreds of years, and some, including me, would argue it is an important part of Swiss tradition
It is a complex thing and would take pages to explain
Swiss people follow rules we agree to as a group, we don't look for loopholes in the law to exploit, we follow the laws we created
If you don't like a law, change it through the system
We don't have bile and hate for opposition parties, they are Swiss too, just those with a different opinion
The laws are applied fairly and evenly and people here trust the government, the police, and the courts to do what is correct
We see these things as US, not THEM like in the US
We have a semi direct democracy where the people decide what the laws should be on many important issues that have real impact on our lives
I think the average Swiss feels a part of the government process rather than a pawn like in the US
This goes a long way in creating a sense of community and common good
As for community, Switzerland is rather decentralized
We have a federal government, but more power is with the cantons (like states) and the cantonal governments
This means decisions are local, and often delegated to the towns
Swiss people inside Switzerland identify themselves to one another by their canton
It is sort of like US states, but much more of the power is local, so there is a greater sense that you are your neighbors are in this together
I see myself as a resident of my town, then my canton, then Switzerland
The town in which you live isn't just a place, it is often history and your family's place of origin (an important thing in Swiss tradition that would take pages to explain)
I see myself as part of the town
The community
My family has lived here for at least 600 years, and in 600 more we will still be here
We ARE the town, so we care deeply about it
We care about the school, the old people, the parks, our neighbors, etc
It belongs to US; It is US
On a larger scale, we are a nation of independent cantons that decided to align and work together
There is a common theme there, one of working together on the larger goal of a nation, and despite our significant differences in language and culture, we see the common ground and focus on that to keep a national sense of community
On the social network front, we have a firm social support system so no one in Switzerland goes to bed hungry or wonders how they will feed their kids
There are job programs, mental health programs, immigrant integration programs, language programs for outsiders, and too many other things to list
If you need help here, it is available
There is no shame in it
I see the health and welfare of my fellow citizens as important to the health of the nation and the quality of my own life
The first section of our constitution states that a society is measured in strength by  the well being of its weakest members
I really believe this
When there are problems, we look to help and fix them, not blame people
There is a bond of community here that makes you care about your fellow Swiss
I can ramble on for hours, but suffice it to say that our two societies are very different in origin and attitudes, and this is reflected in how we think, deal with problems, and treat each other
I just gave a few concepts, some of which are probably true in parts of America as well, but here it is a combination of all of them, plus others that are more difficult to explain, that make our country work
When it all works, people are happy and content, and there is no need for crime, shootings, and the like
No, they are not accurate, at least not entirely
There is for example, no training requirement to own a gun here, no magazine capacity, no reason to justify ownership, no real safe storage laws, no real official waiting period, no resrtiction on private ammunition, and so on
Lots of missing information there and some misrepresentation of Swiss laws by omission
Of course, not a single bit of the videos matter any more as we recently voted to comply with he European Union Firearms Directive, with a few accommodations, so these laws do not represent current (or at least imminently pending) Swiss law
They're full of shit on many things (but that was to be expected)
We're ethnically diverse (about a quarter of our population are foreigners), but most of them come from the same broad cultural background (judeo-christian-influenced, western European)
plus we don't really have clashing subcultures like in the US (e.g. "damn those n*ggers" vs
"white people are to blame for everything")
In that aspect we're pretty homogenous (as in "people agree on and respect the same broader foundation of values and procedures")
>and read that gun owners are screened and trained before they can have a gun (correct me if I’m wrong, though)
Well you're indeed wrong:
The only "screening" is asking for a record extract that doesn't have to be empty (same in the US if you want to buy a gun in a Walmart or any other shop), and no training is ever required in order to own guns
What are you talking about
I beg to differ
A large percentage of the male population is military-trained and an equally large percentage of the privately owned guns are army-issued
I don't have the statistics rn but I'll try to find them
All the males in my family who have gone through conscription have kept theirs and were taught the proper way to store them to make them harmless for anyone else
I don't know about my father's, but my uncle's generation for sure wasn't even given ammos for them
Meaning, our culture sees these weapons as the the last line of defence in case of national threat
They are meant to be handled only by people who were trained to do so, they are meant to defend the country, they aren't for personal use
Another huge percentage are bound to be for hunting and shooting clubs
So, the people using them receive training as well
And they're often not something you can walk around and keep hidden anyway
Buying anything else requires a permit that's issued after a background check
Carrying permits are quite rare and require further examination of one's handling skills and safety awareness
Finally, like I said, Swiss gun culture is very different from American gun culture
Our citizens usually trust the government, the police, and their surroundings and leave their guns and rifles at home unless they're going hunting
I'd be curious to know how your experience differs, mate
A very large percentage of our guns are army-issued and therefore owned by people who have been military-trained
Another large percentage of gun owners belong to shooting clubs, often from a relatively young age
A carrying permit requires further examination of one's handling skills and safety awareness
Reasonable force has to be used, but it also depends on mitigating circumstances
The law only says it shouldn't be accessible from an unauthorized party
Legally your locked front door is enough
Also the police has no right to come and check how your weapons are locked unless you own one from the *generally prohibited* category such as a full-auto (you know, the ones banned in the US since 1986)
To me the biggest merit is the fact that in Switzerland the NRA does not exist and no one is putting fear into people about the fact that some day someone may want to get your guns
Apparently about some things you aren't fully aware of how they work
Edit: my formulation feels a little aggressive, it was not my intention
>A large percentage of the male population is military-trained
Only 14% of the population goes to the army each year, that's not large, albeit more than in the US
>and an equally large percentage of the privately owned guns are army-issued
Army-issued rifles aren't accounted for in private owbership
Even if, only less than 25% of army-issued firearms are bought at the end of service
Though it's true it was unchecked before and we have no prior data
>Meaning, our culture sees these weapons as the the last line of defence in case of national threat
They are meant to be handled only by people who were trained to do so, they are meant to defend the country, they aren't for personal use
That's only for the part that actually serves, and even then it's not true for everyone
Anyone can buy a full-auto legally in Switzerland, which is not the case in the US as they are banned since 1986
>Carrying permits are quite rare and require further examination of one's handling skills and safety awareness
That doesn't impact your initial statement though
A regular gun owner has nothing to do with someone with a carry license
>So, the people using them receive training as well
For hunting
Yes as there's a license to get
In ranges
No as no training is ever required in order to buy
But it's true that after a while you're somewhat trained
>Buying anything else requires a permit that's issued after a background check
Yes but anything can be acquired with a record and "history of violence, addiction, or mental health issues" aren't checked
Heck it's even illegal to do so in most cases
Also in case you didn't know, in order to buy **any** firearm in a US shop, you need to fill in an ATF form 4473 which is a way more invasive and prohibitive WES that has a mandatory background check
>Swiss gun culture is very different from American gun culture
Our citizens usually trust the government, the police, and their surroundings and leave their guns and rifles at home unless they're going hunting
I won't argue that our culture is different than the US one, but your initial argument was flawed
We don't make sure everyone is reasonably trained as there's no requirement, the background check doesn't need to be empty, history of violence can only be checked if it was reported to the police or resulted in an arrest (and it's not even a veto), and finally addiction or mental health issues are protected by medical secret and cannot be accessed by the police
Then misinform me with your knowledge
That second amendment foundation seems prime avenue to spread more fear mongering
Only in the US things like that are considered valuable
>misinform me
That's very dishonest of you
>has gone through extensive training
You clearly never went to the army nor work with soldiers to say that
I've seen more rule violations and dangerous handling during one Obligatorischschiessen than in 10 years working in a shooting range
The training the recruits go through is poor to say the least
>It is illegal to use it or carry the gun unless you are on your way to the military service
You can absolutely use your service rifle outside of the army and it's perfectly legal to transport to somewhere other than your base or your home
Usage of your issued rifle outside of the army is even encouraged
>If you use it at home for self defense (home invasion or anything else) you are not allowed to use that weapon and you will be found guilty of inappropriate use of force
You can, just not in most cases as indeed reasonable force has to be used
It also depends on mitigating circumstances
If you call Swiss training poor then you have certainly never seen the US requirements
A 30 min video is all they need and in most cases zero
I did do my service by the way
You are certainly not allowed to carry your gun anywhere you want, your examples have very strict rules
>If you call Swiss training poor then you have certainly never seen the US requirements
The fact it's poorer someplace else doesn't take away the fact it's not "extensive training". That is a huge overstatement
>You are certainly not allowed to carry your gun anywhere you want, your examples have very strict rules
To be tacky "anywhere you want" is a stretch but "anywhere" would be technically true depending on the destination
My point was that you said it's illegal to carry unless you're going to the army, which is wrong given there's instances where you can go someplace else legally while carrying
Albeit it is without magazine inserted
Depends on your life goals
For example I would say I have decent disposable income but buying my own place is almost impossible considering I can't get a bank loan unless I have half a million swiss francs to put down as a deposit
My rent is about 4
5K a month
A mortgage is much cheaper
No offense taken
I suggest you play around with the UBS Mortgage calculator
Even if you're earning 100K a year you won't be able to afford the 600K CHF flat by putting down 120K as the downpayment
You need to put down at least 140K.
And 600K for a flat is unheard of in Geneva
You're looking at minimum 1M to 1
5M for a 2 BR
Geneva
Using non-Swiss terms a 3 BR, 2
5 bath, about 130m with one indoor parking spot
FYI I've been in the market to buy and something similar is 1
9M - 2
3M.
For the masochists
There are some new developments but half of them are social housing (which is super controversial among some groups), and the other half are based on a lottery
There are also cooperatives, which I think are pretty cool but also miserable to deal with
\>There's a 120m2 apartment in there for 660k.
Read the details
The value is 1
5M.
It's one of those situations where you pay the seller 680K, and then 1
5K a month  as rent and let the seller live there until they die

Yes, it happens from time to time because I predominantly converse in English in my everyday life
It's not something I'm proud of though
In fact, it makes a bit sad
I used to have an excellent active vocabulary in German (all of my German teachers used to tell me that I should become a novelist) but since my English improved dramatically, especially after living in the US, my active German vocabulary has decreased
In normal everyday life conversations it's not very much noticeable but as soon as I'm trying to write something elevated, be it creative writing or a paper for uni, my mind goes blank on all the great German words that are out there
Same
I speak swiss german with my friends but sometimes my brain throws in random english words because it can‘t come up with the swiss german word
I think it‘s because when for example talking about movies/tv shows (which I watch in English) my brain connects it with the English language
But it‘s okay, my friends do it too and we understand each other
I hate translating word for word
I usually know what the word means and can use it in context but I can‘t translate it back to German
Finnish, or maybe Swedish
Swedish is my favorite Nordic language
Faroese = then listen to Eivør ! :)
There is also /u/lolidkwtfrofl
Specifically in the case of Swiss I wish we had an imperfect (preterite) tense
There are situations where it would make the language quite a bit more elegant than if everything is always expressed in present perfect
One thing that bothers me about German (as well as Swiss) is that they are absolutely horrible languages to use in the bedroom
Like, you just *cannot* sound hot when you dirty talk in German
No matter how hard you try, you will end up sounding either creepy or super cringy in 100% of the cases
We have a million different names for the genitals but they are all so
corny, gross, weird
just not nice
In fact, there's even a [song] about this by the former German band Joint Venture
We have the exact same thing in Swiss German
We use „Kolleg“ („Colleague“) for our non bf/gf friends, which is really confusing to anyone who is a non-Swiss but speaks German
You can also say the wonderful sentence „Er isch ned min Fründ, mir sind nur befründet
“ and it‘s completely logical
This literally translates to „He‘s not my friend, we‘re just friends
“ (meaning ofc „He‘s not my bf
I just imagined dirty talk in Swiss German and it definitely sounds like a porn parody, haha
What also annoys me with Swiss German is this:
EN: The friend with whom I went to school (*or* who I went to school with)
DE: Der Freund, mit dem ich zur Schule ging
CH: Dä Kolleg (mit dem) woni (demit) id Schuel bin - wtf
Does anyone have a better solution for this
France - shitshow incoming
Germany - feelbadsman
Italy - shitshow
Liechtenstein - No differences
Austria - idk

I don't know, we never really had family gatherings due to there not being a family
Also, there wouldn't have been other kids
We always had a kids table in my family during gatherings
It was mostly because the main table wasn’t large enough to sit everyone, so us kids would sit at a smaller one together
Of course for our regular everyday meal we would sit with our parents at the same table, but when the cousins, the aunts, the uncles and the grand-parents come over you gotta make room
Same for me, and for my children
We always had one on one side of the family but not on the other
The table was just too small to fit everyone at our paternal-grandparents, so a kids-table was the natural solution
Actually we still sit at a separate table on Christmas, even though the average age at the 'kids'-table is now early to mid-twenties (some of the cousins now bringing partners has not at all helped relieve the issue of too small tables xD)
No, no one would care
The Swiss Federal Supreme Court has 38 judges with seven different chambers ranging from 5-6 judges each
Swiss French and their septante (70), huitante (80) and nonente (90) will prevail
On the serious side, I don't know if it's because I'm used to these numbers or what, but I've always found the France French way to say them as a complexification that doesn't need to be
The Swiss way is the way to go
Septante, huitante, nonante master race
Dutch really looks like the forbidden child of German and English
There must be a little over 1 million of us who use septante, huitante, nonante out of over 300 million french speakers in the world
So we truly are the elite of french
I want to keep that as much as possible, but I'm starting to hear so much people saying quatre-vingts in Switzerland it's alarming
lots of cold War age bunkers here are used for lounge rooms and common rooms for children, or for sports rooms
However, most of them still have maintenance requirements so that they can be used quickly in an emergency
Not sure if there are (abandoned) bunkers of foreign military forces at all
I don't even know what foreign forces are or were stationed here tbh
I don't think that any troops are stationed here, that would compromise neutrality I would think
I know that there are Liaison Officers (Ger
Verbindungsoffiziere) of various armed forces in Switzerland but I wouldn't call them troops stationed here (even though technically they are) as they are as far as I know stationed at their nations embassy

Although it's more dialect than Swiss standard (although many Swiss people don't know that),  "springen" in Switzerland means "running" as well as "jumping" (dialectal "gumpe" for "jumping" isn't used), whereas it means only "jumping" in Germany
So you can read phrases like "Um sich abzureagieren, ging er um um den Block springen

Is Ataturk unpopular in Greece because of the Izmir thing
It does happen in Switzerland
English has replaced French/German as the main medium of communication between the different language areas, people are less and less bothered about learning any other language other than your own and English
I am not disagreeing with your premise, but to offer some counter-thoughts: that would only replace a language in a trivial way if the elements didn't also wither away like regular language (but more at an increased rate, because foreign elements are especially subject to fashion)
For example, much of the trendy French lingo of the 19th century or Latin/Greek one before that has disappeared from European languages
English isn't safe either: anecdotally, I used "cool" in my childhood 20 years ago but don't anymore, and haven't heard it used IRL for a very long time
Using "cool" has become "uncool". Similarly, "epic" (or the translation "episch") was omnipresent lingo 12 years ago but nowhere now
They are well known among history buffs, but not among the general pop like your examples; [Swiss mercenaries] and [Landsknechte]
Right now
No better time than the present
Definitely not the 80's. I was in gymnasium in the 80's, then the Swiss army

There's a scene in SpongeBob SquarePants where Mr Krabs is visited by the Flying Dutchman and tries to get him to leave by telling him he isn't Eugene Krabs, he's "Harold Flowers" (because a flower is standing right beside him)
In the German version, he calls himself "Benjamin Blümchen" - "Blümchen" literally means "little flower", so it still fits his quick glance to the flower vase
However, the joke is made much better by the fact that Benjamin Blümchen is a well-known character from a German childrens' TV show - who was coincidentally voiced by the same voice actor as Mr Krabs
So Mr Krabs is just saying "I'm not Eugene Krabs
I'm..." in his normal voice and then he completely switches to his calm "Benjamin Blümchen" voice while saying his fake name
[Here's the scene in German
Edit: [Picture of Benjamin Blümchen]
In Switzerland, there are 9 of them
What is notable is that they are not directly in the big cities but in their surroundings (about 10-30 kilometres)
9 and the first IKEA outside of Scandinavia
there's 11stores in Switzerland
Also, they all are directly near a highway
So about 1 per 950k people
Looking at other comments, I guess it makes sense that we have a higher Ikea density than some larger countries like France or Germany
But compared to smaller countries, it still is quite a lot
I feel like we don’t really belong to any group of country
Here in the french speaking part I feel closer to France and therefore western Europe, but maybe german speakers feel closer to central Europe and italian speakers closer to Italy and southern Europe
I can’t say for them though, so it’s just an assumption
But as a whole, we’re just that donut hole in the middle of Europe
All Swiss people agree that we're Switzerland
I would say Switzerland, but we're our own thing because of the cultural differences
The people who think that way usually are nationalists to an unhealthy degree
Not everyone, but in voting those regions still are generally dark red
I wouldn't, we have our own identity

Switzerland and Lichtenstein are really close
Lichtenstein even uses the Swiss franc as currency, Swiss police, the Swiss army defense, Swiss customs control, and the Swiss postal service
I see them as a canton that opted to not join the confederation, choosing rather to have their own independence, but there is so much in common between us that it still feels like home there
Even their decision to not join is a very Swiss like attitude
I would disagree a lot with this
Now if you had said Bavaria and Austria ...
Look at Swiss interactions with NATO, the EU, and the UN
We tend not to join a lot of things, or we spend a lot of time really thinking about it
Also, Swiss people don't like anyone, including other Swiss people
I'm pretty sure we're not technically allied in that kind of sense, but if war broke out and Liechtenstein was dragged into it, they would probably request help from us

Swiss German is widely spoken in everyday life by all age groups despite the official language being German (yes, that's a different language)
I grew up close-ish to the romansh speaking region(s)
There the situation seems no be different, I had multiple friends at school who spoke romansh at home but more or less only spoke Swiss German the rest of the time
That's a hard one to answer
Yes, kinda, maybe
In my not at all representative experience most immigrants end up with a somewhat unfortunate semi Swiss German
The problem is Swiss German is not standardized so it's near impossible to learn in a structured sort of way (there are basically no courses, no textbooks etc
Most take German courses and learn German (which already is not an easy Language) and then build on that
Which means they often use German vocab or Grammar within otherwise Swiss German sentences - sounds a bit odd but usually it's workable
Second Generation immigrants (and people that came to Switzerland when they were children) usually end up with a very good level of Swiss German (maybe with a bit of an accent but not more), because it's the language spoken on playgrounds, in sportsclubs and in school, at least among peers
In my (again very subjective) experience all of this is true for any immigrants except for Germans, who tend to just keep on speaking German (just see the German responses on this comment thread - they think of Swiss German as an accent or at best dialect which does not warrant the effort to learn it)
Exactly
Little things like "Treppe" instead of "Stäge" or "Karotten" instead of "Rüebli"
Tried to argue this point multiple times already with this user, they won't listen
Fact is the distinction between language and dialect can not be drawn clearly when coming from a purely linguistical standpoint
It's largely a political or cultural line
I have never met a Swiss German native speaker who sees Standard German and Swiss German as dialects of the same language
And from that standpoint I argue quite confidently that Swiss German is not a German dialect but it's own, distinct language
"Pferd" instead of "Ross", "Kartoffeln" instead of "Herdöpfel", "ihchaufe" instead of "posta".
But there are also grammatical things, the example I have in mind is "I war wandera" perfectly fine by German grammar "Ich war wandern", but in Swiss German the Präteritum form doesn't exist so the proper translation would be "I bin ga wandera" (Perfekt form with "bin ga")
The selection is surprisingly quite robust in Geneva

But come on, people get sooo damn mad at eachother for such small things, like when someone quickly walks over a mostly empty street without using a zebra crossing
Who cares
Edit: Better wording
No, they usually don't like to talk more than absolutely necessary
Well, I've never had kebab before
Zurich and Geneva are both located not very centrally and were already very developed, so they wouldn't have had the space to house government buildings
secondly, the two largest language groups French and Swiss German are both appeased a bit, since Bern is kind of in the middle of those two areas (despite being mostly Swiss German)
another fun fact is that we officially don't have a capital city, the government is just seated in Bern, so it's the de-facto capital
We technically don‘t have one
We only habe a Ville fédérale, where the government and parliament are
Back in the day, the government switched cities every year or every two years
When modern switzerland was founded, three cities where candidates: Zürich, Bern and Luzern
In the end parliament voted for Bern, because it was relatively close to the big french speaking part of switzerland
This isn't quite accurate
I mean, it's very oversimplified
Originally, the government would move from one city to an other a very year or so
There were 4-5 cities in rotation, including Baden, Zürich, Freuenfeld, and Luzern in early Switzerland, and then Fribourg, Soleure, Lucerne, Berne, Zurich and Basel during the Napoleon era
Finally, only Zurich, Bern and Luzern post-Napoleon
When it was time to decide on a more stable system, Zurich was "disqualified" as it already held the most economic power, and they wanted to keep power more balanced
Luzern pas "disqualified" because it had led the Sonderbund in the swiss civil war
This was a Catholic rebellion, against the Protestants that wanted to centralise the gouvernement (basically the catholics were afraid that a protestant central power would be bad for them
This is very, very, oversimplified)
So that left Bern, who had agreed to give land to the federation for free to set up the infrastructure
Bern is more central and more popular with the Swiss-French
Officially though, Bern isn't the Capital, as the "Capital" is wherever the gouvernement chooses to assemble, and according to our Constitution, it can assemble wherever it wants
But why assemble anywhere else if you already have buildings and offices built in Bern
Also, the Federal Tribunal is seated in Lausanne, not Bern, to further "balance the power".
Edit : cleaned up stray words
If you want to tell someone you don't care about what they're saying to you right now you can tell them one of the following
- "läck du mir am tschöpli" (go and lick my jacket/shirt)
- "rutsch mir de puggel ab" (slide down my back)
- "blos mir id schueh" (blow into my shoes)
Those are Swiss German, don't think they even translate to German
Oder wie meine Lehrerin zu sagen pflegte: "Das tangiert mich peripher"
Or "Das interessiert mich nicht die Bohne" (Don't care about the bean) in standard German
*Je m'en tamponne le coquillard avec le pinceau à beurre de l'indifférence et la truelle à maçon*
My history teacher kept saying that
We used to have a nuclear weapons program
(I don't think most Swiss know either, tho
Switzerland has a surprisingly high rate of gun ownership
Wow I didn't know that
Does that mean that "Die Hard" is not a Christmas movie in Italy
Just in case
It was given up because of lack of Uran, the negative response from the public and the Non-Proliferation Treaty
From what I've read they considered this option and thought it likely, some were even prepared to do it, if it would have been the only way out
That of course refers to smaller, tactical nukes
Yes, it is mandatory but only ~60% do the military service (20-25% are unfit and ~10% do a different service)
It's also true that you get to keep the rifle after the service
Many cantons offer a storage place though so you don't need to keep it at home (I guess the Russians aren't coming any time soon)
But you aren't in the reserve after the military service
You have to do a 3 weeks training every year and with ~35 you are finally let go
Then you can buy the rifle for a small price but only if you prove that you have used the rifle in the previous years in sport shooting
I think they mostly require this to reduce the private selling of military rifles
This
Also it was very expensive and the Armed Forces had a metric shitton of other projects which needed financing
I only ever met one guy from there

In Switzerland it isn't.
The inclusion of "ne" when (speaking) negative statements
Example: You're taught to say "Je ne sais pas" (I do not know)
French speakers will just say "Je sais pas".
I think we often use "u" or "ä"
For example: Valentina --> Valä, Melvin --> Melä, Nico --> Nicu, Michele --> Mischu, Manuel --> Manu/Mänu
Might not be like that everywhere but my friends use it like that
Depends on the dialect, you could either be a Dani or a Dänu (or something else), but I would say the - i ending is more common
The "u" thing is pretty much unique to Bern and Solothurn, I think
The most common thing is really to just shorten the name to it’s first syllable, like 'Val' for Valentin or 'Flo' for Florence
I would say that’s the norm, but adding extra sound at the end not so much indeed
Okay, good riddance
Fingers fucking crossed
What are regulators
If you want to live in a different country, you should adapt to - or at the very least accept that country's culture and values
If you want to cling to your own culture and values, you may do so as long as you don't violate any laws of your new home, but you have to accept being a social outsider because of it
If you want to impose your culture and values on the other citizens of your new chosen home - get the fuck out and go somewhere that shares your culture and values already
It should be that simple
Now it is possible that Macron is just a very skilled politician, but in the past few years, he has been one of my favorite/most respected world leaders, alongside Merkel
He appears to be very rational, though I can't speak much on followthrough as I don't live in France or follow french politics and local news
Xenophobia and racism are called out when terrible act like this are used to push an agenda against a whole ethnic gorup, religion or race
What happen is terrible and calling out religion extremism and terrorism it's right, as well as call for protecting free speech, but when the discussion morph into hate for one regligion in particular, then it should get called for what it is
Here you are making the mistake I was talking about before, you are talking about all Islam
While there is still very important group of fundamental Muslim, not denying that, there are also progressive Muslims that don't advocate for violence
Calling all Islam to "evolve" become an attack to a whole religion instead of the critique of a particular group that should be
Because even Christianity didn't "evolve" people inside it changed views and become more progressive
There are still a lot of fundamental Christian groups of various denomination and power
One thing you can do is showing them the progressive ones
How can they function in a more progressive society and integrate with the western values while keeping their own
Or you go kill them all, but I thought christians evolved from there, so that's probably not a solution
By doing the opposite of saying that integrating doesn't work, that we need more strict immigration laws and antagonize them
You show then people in the country that live peacefully while keeping their traditions, and mourn togheter with the christians
[Irrelevant xkcd]
ITT: Merkel is a:

There's also this often-posted picture:   which shows how much space car transportation takes, versus bus and bike
What's the average occupancy of a car at rush hour, versus the average occupancy of a bus at rush hour
The bus could definitely hold more people than that as well, this looks to be only the number of seats
Whereas anyone who regularly takes public transport will tell you that standing in the bus is super common
Reading that while being "annoyed" that the train that should leave at 12:49 just arrived at 12:51
It's still mostly run by private companies (the buses are, at least)
However, it's (1) much more tightly controlled by the government and (2) can be much more profitable at lower prices because there are so many more people in London
Americans be like ooh noo that's literally kommunism

I’m actually not opposed to cultural objects from one country being exposed in an exhibition in another country, because it contributes to educating people about foreign cultures, increasing multiculturalism etc
Years ago they brought some of the clay army soldiers from China to Munich for a special exhibition and it was an amazing opportunity
It just needs to be in accord with the other country
Simply demanding that your art be returned to you, because it’s "YOURS" is a remnant of 20th century nationalism and should have no place in the 21st century
he knew after the battle of Moscow that they could no longer win
His radical social darwinist ideology meant either Germany would win or should vanish
in 1941 Hitler said: "If once the German people are no longer strong enough and willing to sacrifice their blood for their existence, let them perish and be destroyed by another, stronger power
Here what Hitler said to Speer after issuing the Nero Decree: "If the war is lost, the people will be lost also
It is not necessary to worry about what the German people will need for elemental survival
On the contrary, it is best for us to destroy even these things
For the nation has proved to be the weaker, and the future belongs solely to the stronger eastern nations
In any case, only those who are inferior will remain after this struggle, for the good have already been killed
on another occasion he told an SS officier: "If the German people succumb, let them perish and make way for the biologically stronger
there is a very good book about the last year of the war in Germany by Ian Kershaw called The End, which explains the dynamics very well why the civilians didn't/couldn't revolt, why the military fought until the end and the suicidal mania of the Nazi Party trying to take Germany with it

Obviously august is colder than july

I recently went on a small mountain trip with my dad to reconnect a bit after years of a shallow relationship
He told me he went to the same place with us when we were children to walk into the ice caves they made into the glaciers
That was maybe 25 years ago
Today you can see the glacier 100s of meters above in the mountain top
It's crazy to imagine all that ice came down that far

Ya only problem with this one is that you cant compare every theory with each other
Moon and Flat Earth are basic physics principles
9/11 is a huge geostrategic attack on the biggest empire of human history which lead to undemocratic changes of said empire therefore changing the future of humanity
This is the (official) part that we all agree on
Now it would be only fair to humanity and especially the american citizens to know what really happend on that day
And the official report says that a wealthy Saudi (who got into his cozy position because of the US) hired a bit more of a dozen other Saudis who highjacked 4 planes equipped only with cellphones and carpet knifes and hit 75% of their targets
The result of this is the Patriot Act, Iraq war II, Afghanistan (longest US war ever), torture in Guantanamo, NSA scandale and a whole lot of more PITA because of air travel controls/customs
Besides the obvious millions of innocent civil casualties
So the bottom line is that the world most defended fortress (Pentagon) got hit by some arabs without any real motive or resources

Absolutlemt correcte (excuse my shite french - even conductors have told me off, but the sentiment holds)
sad
I kind of agree, but note that plane tickets are _absurdly_ cheap
I was in Hamburg for a couple days this week-end
I went there by plane (Geneva-Hamburg), it was about $40
I came back by train (Hamburg-Basel), it was about $110
$110 for a train travel through all of Germany is pretty cheap in my opinion, even more so considering the good comfort in their ICE trains
Yet it's still nearly thrice what I paid for plane
And if you think about it: $40 for taking the plane
Seriously
It doesn't make sense how cheap this is
^(that being said, Swiss trains are expensive as hell in comparison to our neighbours
We could do some efforts there)
What’s the point of the picture
Everybody knows what a train is
Linking an article sourcing what the Netherlands did would be better>
Follow Luxembourg's path who just announced they will make all public transport free by 2020
I heard a guy once got a train on time in Netherlands
On the other hand, going all in high speed rail like France is not exactly a solution
Local train network are extremely effective at lowering the pressure on the road infrastructure, which has also a big ecological effect and more importantly big economical cost
With jetsmarter, a private jet flight from Geneva to London is barely more expensive than the train as well as infinitely better
Not talking about the prices of DB but about the prices of SBB
For comparison, a one-way ticket from Geneva to St
Gallen is CHF 108 (95€) for a much, much shorter distance than Hamburg-Basel
You can find them for half the price as supersavers/sparpreis, but that's it
I'm not saying that DB is too expensive
I'm saying that EasyJet is too cheap

Why the fuck is this pinned in r/EUROPE
America is a national security threat to Europe and a borderline enemy
Them going through their usual neocon/neoliberal cycle is not going to stop that
Every single problem the continent is facing is because of you
Mostly the middle eastern refugees that are now bringing cultural clashes to Europe, they are refugees to begin with because you destroyed their countries all in the name of jerking off your military industry
On top of that, the divisions in your country over your own cultural clashes are seeping into Europe in the form of populism
All those far right governments that seek to cut Europe into pieces
All those far left governments that tell us to turn a blind eye to terrorism
All born due to American actions and influences
We have none of the problems America has, and yet your cultural imperialism keeps turning people into idealists brainwashed by American matters
All these Europeans in twitter talking about the US elections, their protests, their candidates, what the hell is this
If their country is burning let it burn, the less power America has the more the EU will be able to have, and unlike America, the EU doesn't rely on warmongering to keep it's economy afloat
America is not us
You are not a friend or partner, you are an insidious and subversive agent that seeks to control everything and turn everything into you, and if it resists, you try to destroy it, and the last thing anyone in Europe wants is to be more like the US
The only thing you ever use your "partnership" for is to try to convince Europe of how totally great burning another middle eastern country is going to be, this time Iran, most likely
And by the way, "you are projecting" means nothing at this point

> You don't want to allow a platform for them to advertise their views,
I disagree
> nor an opportunity for the harassment of those they discriminate against (including hate speech)
Again, I disagree
> importance of social justice
And here I disagree the most
Social justice is anything but that, at least to most people who use the term
It's a type of disgusting, vile extremism that I tolerate just as little as the fucktards on the far right
I don't think that people flocking to extremism happens because extremism is allowed freedom to speak
It happens through high levels of dissatisfaction (and/or poor education)
So the way to combat extremism is not to muffle it, it's to create a social climate in which it cannot thrive
The issue with restricting freedoms is that it sounds good until the people you don't agree with are in charge
Furthermore, I don't believe that curtailing speech is in any way morally justifiable to increase "safety" or combat extreme views, because there's no evidence to suggest this
>  you do not want these people to grow their following, it is simplest to cut off their recruitment
Yes, but the way to do that is not to disallow speech, it's to create a population with no interest in extremism
> Regarding the second, I'm not entirely sure what you disagree with
Are you saying that this type of harassment should be tolerated
I'm saying that if you get harassed on an anonymous board then you can close your web browser (and how the hell to people even know what to harass you with
Or you can trust reddit's voting system, which curtails this shit even on loosely moderated boards
De-platforming doesn't work, it just pushes things underground
> (including hate speech)
See, here's the thing
Hate speech isn't "hateful speech" it's "speech that the current powers hate". It's not a precedent I want
See, you speak about appealing to emotion to goad people into joining the far right, mostly tapping into fear
I think this modern push by governments to curtail free speech is the exact same
They use a boogeyman (the far right) to try to get the average person to give up more of their rights to the government
Sue me, but I actually feel worse about the beating up than the Nazi salute
One is an arm gesture from a foreign drunk guy
The other is a responsible local who took it upon themself to act as the moral police, instead of letting the actual police handle it
When I was in Prague on a school trip we saw a shop with masks, including Hitler
Unfortunately, my friend put it on and did the Heil
Granted, it was super stupid (we were probably 15) and inappropriate, but certainly not worthy of a beating
Right, the guy was drunk and foreign
To be fair, Americans died as well because of Nazis
Germany doesn't own the sorrow
Chillax
I highly doubt that the person that beat them up had that background
I'm just saying that Americans have also suffered
It's not like he was specifically trying to offend those hurt by Nazis

"Ok, so it may have been a Russian missile, tank, soldiers, photographs of the launcher going back to Russia, reports, OVERWHELMING evidence and open support of the separatists from the Russian government
But there's no evidence proving it was NOT the United States or Sweden

Also, i love that they are completely oblivious to why anti Russian sentiment is growing the west

Good luck sleeping with that o.o
What I generally do is that I close everything by day, and by night I open all windows and put a fan back to the window so it blows fresh air inside
Also shutting down lights so mosquitoes don't swarm in
It makes a couple degrees difference (from 30°C to 26°C indoor) which can be enough to sleep
Can also take a cold shower just before going to bed, I heard that it helps

this is why I wanted Trump to win, another four years of him would have properly cut the ties between the US and Europe and Europe would have finally started to act more independently
So what
From a foreign policy POV it's much easier to deal with a stable China, which is also pretty transparent what it wants
With the US one might have Trump again in 4 years
Who is easier to plan with
Not really a hard question
The local region obviously is in favour of these bases
But the general population of Germany isn't really happy with them and were mostly happy with Trump's move
But of course Trump doesn't understands anything and thought that Germany would be devastated by his revenge
Oh for sure, you are totally right
I've done some research about the topic of authoritarian environmentalism at University, where the concepts you describe are also very prevalent
Congratulations, you just made a Hitler reference
And as I said below: And I wasn't making a normativ statement what are good and bad countries
I made the point that China is a more reliable/predictable partner than the US currently
Yeah, but since when does Capitalism care about that
There is a lot of countries the EU should not trade with
And I wasn't making a normativ statement what are good and bad countries
I made the point that China is a more reliable/predictable partner than the US currently
But at how many elections do you vote for a President that radically reverts current foreign policy
Fluctuation are expected, but Trump really treated his Allies quite badly
I dont think that has been the case with any US President before
And seeing how popular Trump still is, we might get him again in 4 years

Sometimes I wonder if they actually would have made it into Switzerland
Mussolini was a registered criminal in Switzerland after all
Seems like the easy way out to be honest
People like this should be tortured for years
My grandpa was a kid during fascism and was actually quite fond of those times
Then the war and eventually the Germans came and he told me how they had nothing to eat and would "steal" potatoes from German soldiers, who were actually ok with it
He was just a boy at the time and had a lot of funny stories to tell
Probably he didn't want to tell me the less fun stories about those times
As I said, he was a registered criminal in Switzerland and was deported twice, once for advocation of violent strikes and the second time for falsifying his papers

Yeah, you shouldnt listen to those who throw around the term „fascist“ lightly and even less repeat what they say
I had / have a similar issue
It started around age 23 and, as I later found out, ties into issues that have been around since childhood
I find it hard to find enjoyment in this world and see it in a positive light
I find it hard to ignore what happens - even if I can only see a vague outline - and enjoy the small things everyone always talks about
There is so much negative
stuff around and I find it hard to tune out
A combination of career trouble, death of my best friend, and resulting alcoholism drove me to the brink of disaster
I very nearly gave up and I can't really claim to have "gotten myself" out of that all on my own
Because, in that particular moment, another "me" - forgotten and figuratively beaten out of me since childhood - re-emerged, along with memories of a painful childhood, memories which are still not fully part of "me"; I simply don't relate to them and can’t remember those days
That part of me views the world very differently
There's so much hatred and anger in that past that the present, no matter how bad it might be, barely registers as a drop in the ocean
And from that anger and bitterness stems energy and persistence I simply did not know I / this body / however one views this could have
That part of me showed me that one can actually enjoy the small things and find them to matter, if only briefly, before they vanish in a sea of doom and gloom
That the darkness can be as much a safe place to go unnoticed as it can be a thing to fear and avoid
I just do not know how to see or do that myself
I find it hard to let to, hard to accept that life is painful, unfair, and maybe going nowhere
But there's a part of me which can, so I clearly must be able to too
Somehow
The hardest part, for me at least, is that accepting life also means accepting my memory of the past is flawed – and that many of my issues are deeply personal
That I actually do have memories of extremely painful years which I've repressed, that what I assume I value I might not actually hold dear, that there is anger and resentment buried deep in me, and that there's a whole different version of me, a me which I am more than a little bit afraid of because of that past – a me which is many things I’m not: social, outgoing, opinionated, rash, and at times brutally direct and unafraid
If I could accept that part of myself, I theorize, I could maybe come to see the value in life too - but I'm not sure how
It involves utterly re-evaluing my sense of individuality, of who I am, and everything I have in the past held to be true
It means giving up what I believe I value and cling to as a framework of myself, to replace those notions with what I do actually value emotionally
It means facing the fact I might be a bad person, might think and believe things I find impractical or - worse - flat out morally or ethically wrong
Most of all it means accepting that who I am underneath my rationale and who I think I am / want to be does not really align
To me, it means most of all, accepting I am not in control and have to let go of my existence
Something I find extremely hard to do since “letting go” usually makes things worse and has in the past been my worst fear (if I let go, I will fail – that’s what was hammered into me, even though rationally I know that’s not at all true)
Now, I'm pretty sure not everyone with such issues is in quite the same position I'm in, because most people don't have an entirely different repressed self lingering in their minds at all times
But I think the underlying mechanics are present in many people coming of age in this world
What one was raised with, what one was taught, and reality end up being two very different beasts and I think that happens with every generation
It's left to us to determine how to fit the pieces together, while at the same time trying to make an existence in a world which seems hell bent on removing the ability or hope of doing that
Time and again, I hear the same question muttered, out of earshot of people who might provide simple answers and quick fixes that everyone knows don't work: "what's the point to it all" and “why are we even trying”?
Many people give quick, simple answers that amount to busywork – things to distract the mind with to avoid the harder questions, or fill whatever dissatisfaction is left with some sort of meaning
I do that too to distract myself – it’s a bandaid at most and one that constantly peels off
In all honestly, I don’t really have an answer and am more and more beginning to realize I don’t want one
There’s a part of me which can deal with this, a part which can be profoundly wise and insightful, and insanely dumb and narrow-minded, in the same breath
So my ultimate goal is to become more like that, more able to let go, and hope that somehow improves my perception and quality of life
Though the gulf might be too wide to ever mend completely
I have a sense that, with age, the best I’ll manage is a mostly-healed mental scar, but never a complete “me” again
The two halves have diverged too much over the years
In the interim, I’m dealing with my own problems poorly enough and can, at best, ignore the larger ones in the world and hope they don’t affect me
But I think the deeper truth is that, in order to grow and fill those dark spaces, one does somehow have to let go and let life be as it is
That sounds profound but I’ve no idea how the hell to do that
I find most of my value systems, my ways of evaluating life, are bound into a rational framework I was taught but which is proving… well, not entirely useful in practice
While on the other hand my emotions are a chaotic mess I try to keep at bay, in part out of fear of negative impact, and in part as I do not feel ready or stable to approach them
I’m not sure where I’m going with all this
But what you wrote struck me relatable – by own issues, which revealed a bit soup of deeper problems, started around the same age
Wish I could say it gets better but I can barely say it gets a bit easier without sounding hollow and pretentious

Aside from that, don't ask me
We [have one] in Switzerland too, it was once used for the Gotthard-Route (which ironically contains the word God) between Italy and Switzerland
The new one shows that it's quite an important route
The myth behind it: They had to build a bridge there, but no human could
So they made a contract with the devil: He builds the bridge and the first living being that crosses it becomes his
After he had completed it, they took a goat - which would charge at anything with horns - and showed it the devil
The devil was quite pissed of course and did something to get his revenge, but I sadly can't remember that part
>The new one shows that it's quite an important route
What backs your statement further is that the bridges on your picture are both "new ones", the newest one opened in 1958 and is the third Devil's Bridge, the older one opened in 1830 and is the second Devil's Bridge
The first Devil's Bridge there was built around 1595 but after the second one was opened it wasn't really used anymore so they stopped maintaining it due to which it collapsed in 1888
Before the first Devil's Bridge there used to be Wooden Bridges in that place at least since the thirteenth century

Most countries in Europe get to freezing temperatures

I’ve been to France literally 5min from my house in Switzerland, and some of the roads are patchworks of holes that have been filled in a different color and stuff

Yes
We had to convince the majority of men in Switzerland to let women vote
Which is pretty much unique in the world, iirc
Direct democracy as we have is quite good, honestly, but there is indeed the problem of when the population isn't quite on board which things which should be basic rights
Switzerland doesn't really have ruling parties
There's neither a coalition nor an opposition like there is in other countries
And that's how you'll never convince them to change their views

Small countries can have bigger swings
They closed their nuclear power plant in 2009 from the USSR
Netherlands promotes electric cars because Tesla is in Tilburg
Switzerland has a hydro infrastructure and old nuclear plants as a baseline, no coal and green energy climbing in production
The pumping into reservoirs is slowly being developed too, but it’s not generalized yet
We bought a lot in recent years because our old nuclear power plants had to shut down for maintenance
My point was mostly that Lithuania drop in nuclear production was not due to them switching gear completely, they simply (had to) close their only plant, which shifted the dynamics completely

Interesting because I would have assumed what they eat on shows like friends or seinfeld would be NY Style pizza, seeing as they live in NY, and the kind of pizza they eat on TV looks like a tiny bit of sauce and a tiny bit of cheese spread thinly on 2mm of limp pizza dough
Meanwhile what is sold as American Style pizza in Switzerland is just regular pizza except with comically thick bread, like 2cm

Everything is expensive here
Want a McDonalds hamburger
Pay $2
I think it's around $1
05 (1 euro) in italy right
Yeah Germany and Switzerland are both doing pretty well
The only difference is the everything is just more expensive in Switzerland
Yeah, being Swiss is only really profitable when you are on vacation
Can confirm
I pay 440$ per month in healthcare
Switzerland has four official languages: German, French, Italian and Romansh
I think latin was a way of avoiding the tension between the four groups =)
I mean the smallest (plain old hamburger)
Buns, ketchup, onions and a piece of meat (I think)
Swiss taxes are pretty low, but that's because Switzerland loves businesses
High taxes would force them out and that would be a big loss
The real reason is most likely the banking system during the second world war
We profited from the allies and axis
And from this the economy was incredible stable (no war)
Thus the Swiss franc was seen as a stable currency and it did stayed stable up to now
Right now it's even too strong which forced our central banks to start putting a -% on bank accounts of more than CHF 1M to avoid rich people storing their swiss francs in swiss bank accounts
Taxes are actually lower
The problem is that wages are higher overall
Since the wages are higher, the prices are higher and everything else gets more expensive
What made the whole thing more expensive overall
I don't know
Most likely the strong CHF which barely changed
People invest in CHF to keep their money from devaluing thus the CHF stayed strong in the past few decades
Swiss banks hate it though
That's why we have a -1% tax on bank accounts with more than 1 million CHF to make rich people stop storing their money in switzerland
talkig about this one:
No official minimum wage in switzerland
I'm pretty sure there is no laws at all
There are a few laws for hourly work but for full time jobs there aren't any

We did talk about it
It was the second topic of the day after the other protest
Why that stupid title
This problem is a discussion we often have in Switzerland
In Switzerland there are referendums all the time
There was an peoples initiative from a far right party in 2014
It said there should be a limited amount of imigrants we accept and EU-Citicens would not be able to live as easy in switzerland anymore
The swiss people voted yes
Many citicens weren't happy with the result and wanted a second vote "because they didn't know the consequences". This would have been very inconsequental and treason to everyone who wanted to vote yes
We don't do a second vote in switzerland because some "didn't like the result".
Thankfully the initiative was changed by the parliament which made it essentially useless (which is anti-democratic btw
I don't think there should be a second Brexit-refenrendum in Great Britan
It would be treason to the right and they would get angry and rise up to fight the goverment and bring chaos the country (even more than now)
It would hurt the democracy
Every time someone would be unhappy some people would want to do all again and everything would get inefficient and everyone would get more unhappy

you really just get used to it and it isnt anything special

on the other hand though, i have been away for quite some time and now when i come back im kinda stunned again and realize how nice it actually is
Same, nothing better than a good beer in København
In Switzerland, yes
Lauterbrunnen, no
Too far away from everything (like work)
> they enjoy how flat it is here
It gives a feeling of space
When it's super flat you can see so far away, it looks so big
It's amazing when you come from a place where  you just can't see the horizon because there are always nearby mountains
well they probably go straight for amsterdam:p jokes aside, not everyone here grows up in the mountains
we have plenty of flat, boring areas
me personally, id really miss the mountains if id move away
Don't think you're telling me anything new
Tourism would be massively improved by the removal of tourism
The fact remains that the hordes of (Chinese) tourists are massively detrimental to the enjoyment of these places
We don't even have sea
Seeing the open ocean is quite something
i love that comment from the other thread lol
such different views of topography
there is an area close to where i work where its all hills and i hate it because to me these aren't mountains
like, they are all green and foresty

yeah i know my complaining is kinda unreasonable :D

I terribly feel what happened to Greece
I was studying political economics while it happened and I was fulminating about the troikas moves and the cynicism of the Germans
If the monetary union would be more complete and honest, richer and more productive states should pay for others, just like between the Swiss cantons
Greece has been disgustingly played and the consequences of that is far from over
Germans are convinced it's because they have so much privacy
Exactly
All that plus when you do something simple in Germany, like get internet from some shitty company, they take a copy of your passport
Germans give out their personal info like like it's candy
The government puts so much effort into monitoring their lives
The banks share your info with foreign governments

I've mentioned it a couple of times in this thread, I just don't have 'ö'  on my phone
By the way, why do so many people use the French name, Cologne
Yeah, i just don't have 'ö' on my phone
:D Désolé.
Yeah, I agree

I mean, when your country is completely irrelevant in world politics and you have unlimited oil, you can wear silly outfits and talk about movies
That's not really a europe vs US comparison
Yea, fuck off
This is why the EU matters
We have the power to keep those dicks and their practices out of our continent
Nobody wants US food quality (or lack thereof) "standards" over here
They can keep it
Nope
Thanks

"made in America" is a warning label
Because slaughterhouses in america are less sanitary when it comes to separating the guts and their bacteria filled contents from the meat without any spillage
So they have dirty meat and just spray it down at the end, much cheaper that way
Meanwhile in europe the steps are more careful (so they take more time) but on the flip side no disinfectant is needed at the end
Keep in mind this info comes from me reading through a lot of comments on this post
Also apparently america is slowly changing from chlorine to some other disinfectant, not sure how much "healthier" that one is, tho
Who hurt you
Can someone at least paint the buildings in warsaw
Meanwhile in Germany
no one is thinking of Poland
Nah, not for me
I rather live in a gray block

We're doing fine
This is fine

Fuck nvm, we're 8th, somehow we lost two places
Switzerland 8th, nice
>Centre-right New Democracy party enjoyed a landslide victory over incumbent Syriza in the July 2019 general election
Soon afterwards, a new presidential decree, placed public broadcaster ERT and state news agency ANA-MPA under the direct supervision of the new Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis
It remains to be seen how this new set-up will affect press freedom in the country
Elsewhere, journalists continued to face difficulties in doing their job, with a reporter covering demonstrations marking the 46th anniversary of the Athens Polytechnic uprising being attacked by police, a photojournalist covering the evacuation of a squat being arrested and detained, while the headquarters of the Athens Voice weekly newspaper were ransacked by an anarchist group
This is what they say about Greece

We can‘t be number 1 in everything ^/s
this is amazing
Some background info behind this list
This is the current rankings based on covid border restrictions
If there was no pandemic and no border restrictions, two countries are above Germany
I do believe those two countries are Japan and Singapore
As a Swiss guy who went to an international school and most of my friends aren’t originally Swiss
The ones who became Swiss (most of them since it’s very welcoming here) only use their Swiss passport when they travel now
That’s Spanish, Japanese, British, American, etc friends
All of them for the same reason
Perception
Apart from /r/Europe most of the world likes Switzerland and Swiss people and it’s very unlikely to offend anyone
In fact you get a lot of taxi drivers, hotel receptionists, other tourists, bar owners, etc say great things about Switzerland when you tell them where you’re from
That's what I pointed out but people are some what shut off from reality
This ranking takes into account covid border closures
Like Germans can enter Denmark but Fins can't. In a normal case this isnt the case
The Henley ranking is the true ranking
Very certain
According to those rankings (on the website) New Zealand were the top last year
This is the true ranking:
The measurement methods is visa free access like today
So with a german passport you can enter 135 countries if you travelled today
Without a pandemic, the henley global ranking applies and  will update to measure it
As I said based on this New Zealand was the top passport last year
>The travel restrictions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic have caused a shake-up in visa-free travel
New Zealand is now at the top of the passport index with visa-free access or visa on entry to 128 countries
Japan is in second place with a score of 128, alongside Germany, Austria, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Ireland, South Korea and Australia
Sweden, Belgium, France, Finland, Italy and Spain come in third place with a score of 127
[Source]
Also there is no different measurement methods
It's literally visa free access or not
During covid obviously it differs as countries close borders to each other (ie EU to almost the rest of the world) which is not the case in a non-pandemic environment
What
And not pay for it too
Cool so much new land
Now let's all live in cage sized apartments in Amsterdam

It’s also a question of city vs rural area

Was about to comment this
only for 2020, 2021
And they can still do it if they reimburse the aid beforehand
>    The Government and all parties to the Parliament agree that the extended and extended fixed cost scheme introduces a condition in the Compensation Orders that applicants, as a condition of receiving compensation for the extended period, must declare by faith and laws, that the companies will not pay dividends or buy back shares for the financial years 2020 and 2021
The condition will apply to companies that receive more than DKK 60 million
in compensation in 2020 in the compensation scheme for fixed costs
Companies will later be able to free themselves from these restrictions by reimbursing paid aid under this scheme in excess of DKK 60 million

Wait he forgot the lobbyists
Would be twice the number of bureaucrats
Ah yes
Good ol propaganda
No it doesn't. This is exactly what tried to do with the EU
Reduce the official employee count and costs at a maximum and rely on the "civil society" to provide documentation on whatever matter
This is exactly what negates any political power and debate in the European arena
That's precisely why the EU is seen as a bunch of technical norms and arbitrations
No political group has any ambition or political project other than those arbitrations and norms because they have no decent workforce compared to national Parliaments and are working under pressure and to late on any issues
I don't think that the EU countries are more different than the States of America were before WWI
Another example comes to my mind
At a different scale, Switzerland is, and still is, a multi-cultural, multi-religion country
In 1868 the country was made of very different pieces, with strongly opposed political, religious and cultural views with huge gaps in the wealth distribution
Over time, it got more integrated and we did not wait for it to create an army, we made it at the beginning
Also, we got seriously beaten by Napoleon with our 20 little armies :D that motivated us for one common army
USA NUMBAH WANNNN
Peaceful European unification
by force
It really depends on what you take for values
Yes, the US has impressive GDP
But socially, it's as developed as a 3rd nation with healthcare / education quality and costs as one example, aswell as not really great worker's rights
It's often said that you can have a better life in the USA than in Europe, if you're rich that is
wait waht
The Hungarian “illiberal democracy” model is everything Trump and alike are aspiring to
To me, the most interesting part is that the election system was based on the German model
They managed to slowly disintegrate the political system over the years resulting in the current authoritarian government by fully controlling the media, replacing judges as well as limiting their rights
What a chad

How’s the politics in Armenia
Is your new prime minister managing to clean up the corruption

/r/redditmoment
Could you be more specific of this
What would happen if somebody said (**I AM NOT SAYING I ACTUALLY BELIEVE THIS PLS NO BAN**) it was a response to another event
Is that trying to justify genocide or trying to explain why it was done
I ask because "genocide denial" is a term thrown around too much, for example whenever a Turk talks about the Armenian things without being 100% apologetic (when he personally did nothing) everybody says he's denying it
Probably if the Swiss invaded them again
Some respond to the murder of one of their countrymen by holding a silent march with white roses to symbolize grief and memorial photographs of past victims
Others ignore the murder and protest those who have a problem with it by holding a concert
There's fascism
These people are against that
> It's not like everyone protesting is a nazi
Maybe not, but they are way to comfortable to walk with Nazis and don't distance them self from them nor the resulting violence
Frankly that sort of behavior is just as bad as actually being a Nazi
Do you seriously think that's even remotely the right way to "raise valid concerns"? I don't know about you, but I certainly was raised better
You can bet that if some assholes tries to "argue" with me in that way that I would have walked away long time ago
I'm actually impressed by the women for trying that long to have a discussion while 3-4 people are screaming at her at the same time
They show zero respect and zero interest in having an actual discussion
The later would require them to actually let the women get a word in
> So by your logic people are either forced to accept that a known criminal wasnt deported despite significant evidence of his crimes and this is perfectly fine, or they are nazis
Nope, they could have gone home and organise another demonstration
And if Nazis show up, the organiser could actually ask the security personal to remove them
Tadaa
I've solved the walking with Nazi Dilemma for you
IT'S NOT THAT HARD TO NOT WALK WITH NAZIS
But you would actually have to care about it
> They're clearly pissed off by her apathy
So fucking what
That's no way to have a discussion and they should be ashamed of them self for acting that way
But again, those asshole clearly show that they don't WANT to have a discussion
What they wanted was their very own "two minutes of hate".
And in what way does all of this make their actions even one bit right
How can you actually come here and make excuses for that kind of behavior
And that's even if all their fear would be justified, which by actual statistics they aren't. For starters Saxony has one of the lowest rates of foreigners and actual crimes are on a steady decline (down 9% in 2017 for example)
But that's beside the point
Even if all their fears would be completely justified that would still be a fucking disgraceful act of those "adults".

Azerbaijan and other Caucasus have disputed status because of such proximity to the Caucasus mountain range seperating Asia and Europe with their culture, but Turkey is a different story except for Istanbul, which is obvious

The main problem I see with a ban is that the operation would then be performed illegally, back alley style, much to the detriment of the little "patients". I see much more pronounced mutilation, up to many deaths as a result of a ban
Maybe in time things would improve, but in the short term, many babies would suffer worse fates than missing foreskin
(I'm all for this practice ending swiftly, but it probably has to happen through education
Good luck
Is this only major lines
The map seems to exclude most of the Rhaetian Rail, granted it is narrow gauge, but still
well the swiss railway is displayed much smaller than it actually is
Shouldn't Switzerland be more dense, I mean we literally got the world's most dense railway network
Switzerland also has way more lines
This is a very inaccurate map
Same for switzerland
There's even a UNESCO world heritage line missing on this map
Not complete at all, the Swiss train network is waaay bigger than displayed here
Use [openrailwaymap

I'm sorry but I completely disagree with you
We don't need to honour people like King Leopold with statues of him in public commemorating him
This pic will forever haunt me (extremely NSFL):
You're barking up the tree for the wrong person
They should instead put up a monument or statue for his victims like Germany did for the Jews, literally right next to where Hitler died, while the spot he was burnt is just a carpark
They can put his statue in a museum or whatever, again with the focus on his victims rather than that bastard
Historically people can be morally ambiguous, true
But in cases like this for this monster, there should be no argument at all
Perkele
>And what am i supposed to do
Travel to Ireland and threaten to punch everybody in the face if they dont stop being a tax haven
Ireland only works as a tax haven because of how the EU is setup
That's something that can be changed without punching any Irish
The EU was setup to allow free inter-country trade
It allows a company in Ireland to sell in Germany without actually having a presence there, because small outfits can't realistically open an office in every EU country
The unintended side effect is non-European companies (and maybe more mercenary European ones) chose Ireland as their EU HQ, because it doesn't matter to them where they are and corporate tax is low
So the loophole is massive companies act like Irish-only companies
Prevent that
One option is to rethink EU law, forcing companies with a significant presence in Germany (for example) to pay standard corporate tax on Germany based subsidiaries
In effect, companies with > XXmillion revenue have to open a proper German branch to do business, reporting profit/loss at a local level, and excluding licenses from expenses
Another option is to try to tax economic activity locally, e.g. just straight up tax revenues collected in a country irrespective if they're profits or not
The nice benefit to these is they actually solve the apparent issue, which is German revenue should result in Germany taxation
Otherwise, why care
Taxes are not paid as punishment, they are paid to fund something
If the Irish don't want high corporate taxes, so be it
Why does a German care that a corporation in Ireland pays low taxes
How would higher Irish taxes help Germany
As an aside: this is clearly divisive

Love seeing foreign Europeans comment on the language region situation of Switzerland or question whether the language regions are closer to their neighboring country
I think some people think we're not united or something
Being a multilingual collection of cantons is literally the fabric of the country
You see the flags of every canton being flown in every other canton
It'd be difficult to go a day without seeing all of the country's languages in some way
We are born and raised in a multilingual Swiss culture
It's not weird or divisive
I am at home whether in Geneva, Lugano, or Zurich
We have the same shops, the same sports teams, the same education, the same languages, etc
Just an example
I go to University in the French-speaking part of Switzerland
I go to lectures with people from every region of Switzerland and people from across the world
The Swiss hang out together regardless of languages
We have the same culture and are all in our country
Don't project division onto us, it's pretty annoying
Examples of unity and how diversity is literally the whole point of Switzerland and it's embraced
> you'll be literally frowned upon if you dispose glass outside these hours
in Switzerland people would call the police
Small addition: while we are indeed politically irrelevant, we have some diplomatic relevancy as we act as liaison between [Iran and the US] have a role in the [Korean conflict] and other such small diplomatic missions, as well as Geneva being in general an international hub for organisations
So it's not exactly correct to say we are completely disinterested in the world stage, we just leverage our neutrality to hopefully do some good
It's not that nice
But hopefully the girl is nice
Good luck in Poland

I like how Switzerlands oldest business is a restaurant called Sternen
It's one of the most used restaurant names in Switzerland, clocking in at about 230, according to an [article in the NZZ] from 2013
The oldest Swiss company is older than Switzerland
The old Swiss confederacy was established in 1291
as a swiss I have to say this is really low effort
Restaurant zum Sternen (Tavern to the stars)
well thanks but which one
there is one in every village and it not a franchise so it could be any of about 2000
Switzerland: There is almost in every village a restaurant ("Gasthof") called Sternen
I'm still somewhat confused about Switzerland
does the very thin white stripe mean that it's counted to Germany
No, Switzerland should be solid gold

Well I don't even get annoyed at Belgian chocolate since it's so obviously not as good
I can't name a single Belgian chocolate brand, meanwhile the likes of Lindt, Toblerone, the whole Nestle lot, etc are world known, and those are just the industrial mass-produced ones
They make good chocolate no doubt
It annoys me more when people say that the British make the best chocolate and that Cadberry is the best brand
Ya it's the best if you like the taste of ass in your mouth
If I wanted the fakest, most sugary, most caramelized chocolate in the world, then yes I'd love Cadberry
Swiss here
This is spot on
Well, it is actually technically correct as not all of it was returned
For me the real trigger is "Switzerland got rich because of Jewish gold".
My reaction for the chocolate for me is more like : "Is it
Never tried it
For the gold it would be more like : "Oh my god are we gonna have to talk about that AGAIN
" So yeah, more irritated
I disagree
The chocolate thing triggers me much more
Also it's not true, tbh
Tell here I love Oktoberfest
> I can't name a single Belgian chocolate brand
Jeff de Bruges
Oh wait
IT'S *FRENCH*!!!
Yes, one of the conditions for the access to the global market the US enforced after WWII was that Switzerland pay billion worth of fines for all the trade the confederation had with the Nazi regime
So we gave back the Jews' gold
^(Not sure we gave it back *to* the Jews, though
I've heard of Godiva, but not in the chocolate field haha

Yeah, our Chocolates are the best, but Belgium help, competitors makes us stronger
But lets be real, I'd binge eat most kind of chocolates anyway
That's because in the international system, countries owe money to other countries
In other words, money goes from one central bank to another central bank
Because there is not central bank for the victims of the Holocaust, unless individuals demand reparations (usually though a trial), no one is going to give them a penny
Like Ghiradelli

WWII itself is also the best argument against demanding reparations in the first place

I was wondering why Switzerland was doing worse than Germany and Austria, but then I remembered that we have 2 (well actually 3 but u know) other main languages who generally do worse in English than German speakers
Also, we start learning English later in school because we always start out with another main language (French, Italian or German, depending on where you're from)

Ah those fuckers
Those fucking pigeons
Rant time
I live in a shitty flat
Building older than most countries on Earth, 1 room + 1 kitchen marketed as "2 rooms with fitted kitchen" (but actually not equipped), door so well insulated that I hear my neighbours in their own flat, no laundry room, rent $1240 monthly
The view is on a small humid courtyard where the Sun doesn't reach the bottom
And it's that courtyard that pigeons elected to be their home
At any time of the day, there are between 10 and 20 pigeons in there
By the windows, on the walls, on the outside window covering, everywhere
And they just stay there doing nothing all day other than noisily saying "rou". All day
Non stop
A frequency of one "rou" per second, for _hours_. You can't open your windows without hearing these fuckers going "rou", aggressively so because they're so damn loud
They make more noise than the neighbouring tram line FFS
And they looove my windows
Seriously, my kitchen windows are covered in pigeon grease because they come and snuggle against it
If I clean my windows, it may last only two days before they're covered in grease again (no exaggeration, two days)
On my room windows, there are two rails of anti-pigeon spikes
But guess what
They don't give a damn
They come anyways
I keep my window blinds (whatever they're called) shut because otherwise they do come
Last night I forgot to close the blinds and I couldn't sleep before 3 AM
Figured out I could sleep this morning
Guess what motherfucker, the pigeons had another plan
Woke me up at 7 by the loud noise of them snuggling against my window, pushing the spikes away
Four of them
Making enough noise to wake me up through a window that insulates ambulance noises
FFS
I hate pigeons

“Structural Funding to areas in decline” is the opposite of what a good investor does, namely investing the funds where they create the most value

Surely there would never be an EU country allowing halal practices
A good investor is one who creates actual value (as opposed to taking it away from others in a zero-sum game), thereby making the pie bigger such that everyone benefits in the end
Investing is about finding the optimal allocation of capital
It is in everyone’s interest that resources are not wasted
So you're saying that halal slaughter is allowed in some EU countries and in other countries it's forbidden
I wonder why some countries in the EU forbid halal slaughter
Seems to me that it's discrimination on religious ground if it's only prayer and ritualistic turning, and no difference in cruelty for the animal
News for you: it is possible to create value without destroying something else
So, there's discrimination in the EU

Since halal slaughter is cruel, and halal slaughter is allowed in some EU countries and others not, then it suggests that some countries are discriminating a perfectly cruelty free slaughter method based on religious grounds
Or termed differently:
If there is cruelty free halal slaughter and the EU allows cruelty free slaughter in general, then every EU country should allow halal slaughter
Why are there still countries which do not allow halal slaughter
You wanted an example of creating value
But also financial investments can create value, for example if you enable someone to become a successful potato farmer
So I'll try to summarize to see if I understand you correctly
If we take into account orthodox groups, then every EU country is discriminating on religious grounds
If we don't consider orthodox groups but only "moderates" (whatever that means), then it's not clear yet what constitutes cruelty and what not, and as soon as that is a given by the EU, then there are countries which discriminate on religious ground
Maybe the countries who currently allow halal will be the ones discriminating
Maybe the countries who currently forbid halal will be the ones discriminating
In any case, the EU does not regulate anything regarding halal, the one way or another and it's something that's currently up to the countries

That's weird
But I was there in August, not winter

>  Politicans are people too, they can have their opinions
Here's the thing, to me this issue is something that you can't brush aside as "oh it's just their opinion". It's morally wrong to deny this right to people
It's not that far off (to me) from if, say, Merkel voted in favor of racial segregation and you'd just brush it off as "oh well, she's not getting in the way of the yes voters, she can have her opinion".
Denying people an equal right because of your religious beliefs
Just bad morality
I mean marriage itself is just a stupid religious thing
Denying it isn't really amoral
Denying them equal rights is however bad

That route is not particularly difficult since you only have three major climbs and none of these are beyond 1'500m(The one from Broc into Simmental, Brünig and Sattel)
The route from Montreux to Rorschach is circa 440km and climbs a total of 3'400m. A well seasoned randonneur could do this in two days, no problem
If you're resonably fit and keen but want to soak in the scenery 3-4 days might be appropriate, if bicycle touring is new to you might want to plan with a week or even more
Keep in mind that while the height of the passes doesn't encompass high alpine regions the difference in altitude is not to be underestimated when it comes to climate
Weather changes in the alps can be swift and drastic, especially during the height of summer
Pack some rain gear and something warm
When it comes to prices it's hard to guess, if you like wild camping and are mostly self sustained when it comes to cooking you can travel with less than $5 a day, if you have 3 meals in restaurants and stay in hotels every day you can easily surpass $100
If you're a bit on a budget and stay in youth hostels and don't eat too fancy $40-50 a day is probably a good guess

The value fluctuates based on your economy, not German economy
Things are going bad, currency depreciates, easier to export stuff cause it's cheap for others, tourists show up
Things are going good, currency appreciates, buy a bunch of stuff from others, pay off loans
Or you can just change the value to control things like inflation
Print money, issue bonds, do whatever the fuck you want

the only good-looking part of the city
The greatest thing about Bern is the view from the Kornhausbrücke I get every morning on my way to work
Can confirm
We are a postcard city
Between r/travel r/pics and r/europe, I see this exact image every month
Same goes for that matterhorn lake picture and Grindelwald-Interlaken
Well it's the oldtown, is that relation anything special for any european city
Geneva looks pretty good outside of old town, around the lake
same with Zurich
Bern is mostly ugly industrial-looking buildings outside of old town
That’s probably because you have never been here and your only impression of Bern is the train ride through Bümpliz and Bethlehem (quite ugly)
Bern Lorraine, Breitenrain, Wabern, Kirchenfeld, Weissenbühl and Länggass are all very nice, filled with 1900s buildings, cozy places, lots of trees and large roads
In Zurich and Geneva, everything is dense, the rest of the city is comprised of average 50s to 70s building blocks
I have, in fact, been to Bern
I speak from experience, not a train ride
It's beautiful
It speaks to my soul

November 2007 and they're asking this BS
At that time, we'd had touchscreen controlled smartphones with user installed apps and a wide range of connectivity (3G, BT, Wifi) for more than two years, rapidly gaining popularity
Even the original iPhone had been out for almost a year
Nokia had nothing to compete with these new devices, and everybody who had even a slight interest in mobile devices knew that they needed to come up with something quickly if they wanted to stay relevant
Edit: ok, so the iPhone hadn't been out for a year yet
More like four months
But the iPhone in my argument wasn't exactly an example of how far smartphones already were back then
Argument still stands
I had a two year old HTC Universal back then, that blew anything Apple or Nokia had at the time clean out of the water

Last time we had such an exceptional heat in Switzerland a lot of people died
Take great care of elderly people and young children
Make them drink water until it drips out from the ears
Alcohol, sodas, sugared drinks DO NOT hydrate they need water to be processed
Isotonic drinks are good
Open the windows at night if temperatures drop, humidify the curtains [at that moment]
Keep windows, curtains and blinds CLOSED ALL DAY, (closed as in completely closed)
[Occasionally] hang humid cloth in front of the fans
Don't eat to much or too rich, especially elders and young children
If you wet the curtains only at night when the windows are open and air is circulating it helps and it won't turn your house in a sauna
Similarly, at night and if you live on the first 2 floors, if you through buckets of water on the street under your widows you will have fresh air entering the house
I don't care about the physics of it
It works, old people in the south of France who used it for decades showed it to me
If you put cold water on a cloth an a fan in front of you it will cool you down, just like the water on your skin, the water on the cloth evaporates capturing heat and letting fresher air come to your face
If you do it too much or on tens of fans (who knows
) you might indeed, have too much humidity in your house at some point
Keeping the windows and blinds closed during the day, leaving the heat outside, seems having a better summer 101 to me
unless you have a cardboard house that has no temperature inertia
Yes it would if you do it too much
If the air becomes too saturated in vapor it makes the perceived temperature be much higher
Of course
But, by experience, it is impossible to make old folks and children drink so much that it becomes dangerous
Children are stubborn and generally don't like water as they are given way to much sodas
Elderly are generally already dehydrated because they don't feel thirst as much as other people anymore
Too much water would be the least of my concerns in a heat wave honestly
But, yes, unlimited Isotonic beverages would be the best
I won't. Humidifying the curtains AT NIGHT WITH WINDOWS OPEN helps
It has helped me in Santiago, Chile hot summer
A few humid cloth in front of fans is NOT going to turn your house in a sauna
Yeah I can imagine
A friend lives under the roof of an old building and for sure he has to let air circulate
But in general, whether you live in a modern insulated house or an old heavy walled construction like stone, you're better off opening at nights only
It was in the sequel, Twenty Years After, the names of the castles are never mentioned in The Three Musketeers

Our company was not GDPR compliant at all, not because we sold the data, but because our software and processes weren't up to par
It was stored securely, however some of our employees had access to production databases for troubleshooting purposes and we couldn't say for sure that we would find them all to delete
I think both the anonynisation and the complete deletion of data are aspects of the GDPR
Our main issue was that the system was highly customizable to the point where you had to have the actual prod database to reproduce bugs
Sometimes, even the original, identifying values were relevant
For us to be GDPR compliant, we had to create an anonymisation script for the databases that were accessed by more people and a "quarantine environment" for the databases with original values where only a select few had access
Even finding the sensitive data was challenge, because it's an old system
Creating that script and not corrupting _some_ data took a decent amount of time
Add to that, you can't just drop everything to become GDPR compliant, other issues are time sensitive as well
That means, it takes quite a bit of time
Some systems might just be incompatible with the GDPR if they made some really bad design choices
And I mean _really_ bad ones
Yes, like the US states
Californians always say that, but even though it gets points for being different and unique, I always found the design quite lackluster
Yes, it's not as boring as the Italian tricolor, but that doesn't make it good in any other way

I'm so happy for the UK, greetings from Switzerland
While I don't particularly care about Brexit, I do believe that remaining in the EU would have been the better choice for them
Now that the vote's passed though, everyone (including the EU itself) must/should adhere to the will of the people and start the process
This is where I start seeing problems
Up until now, the EU was this grand undertaking that attempted to unite Europe under one banner, thereby increasing the political and economic power of the continent (whether they actually succeeded is another matter entirely)
However, Brexit now shows that the EU is not set in stone; that there is an alternative
Through this, the EU loses both prestige and power, and the power dynamics within it change
Germany and France have been the biggest controlling powers, and opposition, if any, was often led by the UK as one of the few countries able to oppose this coalition within the EU's parliament
With the UK gone, that's essentially free reign for those two
Now, Brexit has shown other countries that leaving a union you're not content with is an option
Marine Le Pen, one of France's contenders for the next election of the head of state, has already promised a "Frexit" referendum should she be elected
Similar calls have made themselves be heard in the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy and Austria
Brexit is not an incident that can be looked at in isolation; it destabilises the entire EU, which had already taken major hits to its credibility after the Italy/Spain/Greece debt disaster and the surge of immigrants, thereby threatening the economic and political future of many more countries
tl;dr: I'm not even living in the EU
But as a European, the threat of destabilisation Brexit poses worries me
Welcome to the land of side deal and compromises
While it's nice to be out, the deals you have to make can hurt
Unfortunately for some reasons I think the EU will have a grudge with you guys and the deals won't be very good or your side
Oh, I 100% agree
Also the EU has the upper hands anyway in the negotiations since the UK will need those bilateral deals more than the EU does
I hope that this will not affect us negatively, we always had to pay more for our agreements with the EU than if we were in it, but they were still worth it
With the UK leaving and EU having to be more strict and punishing to the UK I'm afraid that deals with other non-eu countries will risk to worsen too

Germany is extraditing it‘s own citizens
I mean you‘d expect a country not to extradite their own citizens in any case, or is that just in Switzerland the case,
Isn’t there a radio tower we could go "visit" somewhere
Ah ok
Still kinda strange to me, but that makes it more understandable
In Switzerland you won‘t get extradited, but you‘ll be tried here for the crimes committed abroad and the lower punishment will be implemented
Not extraditing does not mean law stop at the border, it just means you won‘t hand citizens over to other countries against their will
You can still try them in your own country
But then wouldn‘t it be better to try them in your own country
At least that‘s the case in Switzerland
If you can‘t be extradited you‘ll be tried in Switzerland or you‘ll just serve the sentence here

Also, I know a lot of people seem to think that Socrates was potentially not a real person and just a character used to make Plato's points
Can't say I've read any Aristotle yet
Plato/Socrates didn't like Homer much from what I've read
But both seem like legends in Greece and around the world, which is interesting
I think Plato's criticism of Homer was that he depicted Gods as having flaws (and just generally wrote stories that weren't purely positive), which is supposedly a bad influence on people

Women only gained the right to vote in 1971
When my mother was born, my grandma did not yet have the right to vote
Switzerland allowed some train transport from the nazis through our country in ww2 in exchange for not being invaded
the nazis promptly used that to transport Jews through Switzerland into concentration camps
edit: this is mostly speculation though
We didn't let women vote 'till 1971

Just googled them and in German they are apparently called "Samen" which also is the German word for semen

That was pre WW2 so it was even worse
He wrote a book, well more like a diary, that is still family owned and it‘s absolutely heartbreaking to read through something a 14 year old wrote in pure fear
He got better as time went on, unfortunately I could never ask him about it personally since he died around 15 years ago and I was still really young back then
You're correct
Though there is some speculation that there was some war material (and soldiers) transported through Switzerland illegally in WW2, it's quite secured by historians that there were no "death trains" going through Switzerland
that too, ofc
lots of it is probably still in Swiss possession too

I'd be ashamed if I were British
>given up with politics
You really shouldn't, no matter where you move to
It's risky business letting other people decide for you
Sure
Still not my idea of fun
Hadn't realised we were disagreeing on anything
The Halloween thing was obviously humorous
Sure
Do we even care
Well, I know I do
No comment
When the last of our cantons (states) finally had a vote to introduce women's suffrage ***in 1990***... and rejected it
When Norway was given to Sweden from Denmark as restitution for losing the Napoleonic wars
the only thing i can think of might be the nazi gold thing but that’s about it
or when we voted for those muslim towers to be illegal but no one really thought that would happen until it did
Or when Pro Juventute started a genocide of travellers (especially Yenish people)
Or when Appenzell Innerrhoden rejected the introduction of women's suffrage in **fucking 1990**
Yo we sold chocolates 5 franken each for them at school what the fuck
bruh moment
Genocide
Bitch you cookin
Not a genocide like the holocaust or the Rwandan genocide, but still
>The UN Genocide Convention, signed on 9 December 1948, qualifies forcibly transferring of children of a "national, ethnic, racial or religious group to another group" in the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, as a genocide
Hm that's interesting
I never thought about it this way
Is this a passage of Crime and Punishment
Nice work
Sorry
I don't know how most tools or some special cooking utensils are called in German
Because I learned about them online in English
Yes it's strange if I ask my dad to borrow the angle grinder and it's like "hey can I borrow that thing I always borrow but still don't know the name you know the one with the grinding thing that rotates".
Definitely, I'm living in the US and when I call my family I sometimes have a hard time finding the correct Swissgerman words
Also my actual German is on a whole other level of bad
My wife wants to learn German but I don't think I'm very helpful as a teacher
Lol
Interesting story: I used to speak English in a British Accent and still do
That because of DanTDM from whose videos I learned English and he's British so I speak English with a British accent
I still have a bit of my Swiss accent sometimes come through but that's only when I speak fast
I can also speak English with an American accent
Nope
If I talk "normally" it sounds meh and if I try to have a nice accent I sound posh but in a weird way so no
I'd like to think I've got a rather British accent that rubbed off from my English teachers
I do like the sound of a Swiss accent in English, it sounds cute
my dad, who's German, however has the most horrible, thick German accent and I don't like it at all
Maybe the stereotype exist because people mixed up Swiss people with Germans
Their "k" sounds like when you break a bone and with their "ch" they obviously try to imitate a tiger
Edit: Just remembered my Swiss tag
Grew up here but am German, that's why I said "they"
What's pretty special is that in France, you're mocked whether you have a thick French accent (because you're "too bad" ) or a very good "native" one (then you're showing off)
Whatever are you supposed to do
fuck the english accent how do i remove my Swiss accent from french
I feel like a pompous ass for trying to speak french as my accent isn't that Swiss but it still is noticeable so I feel like I'm trying to be French
Oh shit Hans
Karl call ze ambulance
Nein, Karl
Das ist ze panzerkampfwagen
It might be because of Germans migrating to the Mid-West
Who cares
Have you met an American
Americans care
A lot
For France, Marseille is an easy pick: a tremendously beautiful city and shoreline but really badly administered and a bit corrupted
Unfortunately it’s the second biggest city in France by population
Buildings literally collapsed a few months back because of their dire state, how can this happen in one the richest countries in the world, honestly
I was on vacation in Naples and what bothered me most is that there were no freaking toilet seats
Who steals toilet seats
But otherwise it was interesting, everytime I put my phone in my backpocket out of habit it only took 2 seconds for a Nonna or Nonno to appear and gesticulating that I shouldn't have it in there because it will get stolen
I'd never heard that about Biel, but you're kinda making it sound like Berne's Spreitenbach, which incidentally would be my nomination
Could bundle it together with neighboring Dietikon
Just two really hideous towns with lots of industry and massive immigrant populations and tons of crime
there's a residential tower in Spreitenbach, lovingly nicknamed "Blutwurst" (blood sausage) because of its hideous crimson color and the insane amount of assaults committed there
That castle and the view was amazing, never seen anything like it
Oh my god, that gave me a good laugh
But where did he go to get so ripped off
Oh no, in that case I feel very lucky that at least our airbnb had a normal toilet
Maybe you're not supposed to but I had diarrhoea my guy
Well, sometimes it just sneaks up when you're already out and can't go home
I as a woman had a real "oh shit" moment going to the toilet to pee just to discover that there was no toilet paper but only a hose thing
I can't really think of one
Are swiss people just too punctual
Haha me too
I work at the swiss federal railways (SBB) and we love saying, « shit SBB was late again » when we are late for work :D
Yes
I was about to say we just show up on time
I just chuckled when I saw the post, but I really can't think of anything
Well as they say: "Fünf minuten vor der Zeit ist des Schweizers Pünktlichkeit
" Basically saying swiss people are always five minutes early
Being from Vaud, I just invoke the "Quart d'heure vaudois" when I'm late
Everyone knows vaudois people are always 15min late to everything
We really are
They are, but we still use it as an excuse
They are generally on time, but are far from having Japanese precision
The rail network is much denser though, and it has to be shared with freight and international travel transiting through the country
Yeah that's one of few exeptions where it would be considered rude for us too
Finance/accounting department
Human Resources
Is the guy that never has fun, doesn‘t laugh at your jokes, but does all the work, but only for themselves
Only looks for themelves
Is wealthy for all the paid overtime he does
Never shows up to office parties
except for apéros
Oh yes
No, because I went on an exchange year to the US during high school and after I graduated I went back to live there for another 6 months
These stays have not only improved my English by magnitudes but they have also given me a completely American accent
In fact, when I went to live in South Korea a few years later where a lot of Americans go to teach English, many of them mistook me either for an American or a Canadian
The latter was actually a really good guess because I mainly lived in northern Pennsylvania, roughly 30 miles from the Canadian border
This is one of the fun things about doing these exchange years
When you're a teenager, your brain is still developing and you manage to soak up the specific pronunciations, the accent, the words and the grammar like a sponge
Also, you learn about the local culture and mentality and oftentimes, word choice is related to that
For example Americans do a lot of overstatement, while Brits do a lot of understatement
This transfers into the vocabulary
There are also some things that simply don't exist in one country or the other
Nowadays, at age 31, I'm too old (neurologically speaking) and I wouldn't be able to pick up on these things so well anymore
I see that with my mom who learned English at a later stage in life and uses a funny mix of British and American pronunciation and vocabulary
However, when I was a teenager, I was still able to do this
Absolutely, I use -our
But for other words I use the American spelling
i try to sound british (some kind of southern accent) and spell words the british way but sometimes i get confused which is which or i mess up my pronunciation
I tend to listen more to british english nowadays
I try to avoid american english if possible
idk if it’s actually a canadian thing or if i’m totally wrong but i’ve found that when people say things like
walkin instead of walking (it’s hard to type out what i mean) they’re usually canadian
To be fair even in Europe car rental companies segment their cars in a ridiculous manner
Yes a VW Polo IS technically a 5 seater, but it's not a big car
I lived in the US for nearly 6 years, and my first wife was an American
I would say I have experienced a lot of the US, including visiting all 50 states
Things that surprised me about the US:
Food and drink portions are gigantic
Swiss are famous for the love of cheese and putting cheese on and in things, but America takes that to another level
even if the cheese is less good tasting
They think they have Swiss cheese, but what they call Swiss like a really shit version of Ementaller cheese
They are surprised that we have like 400+ kinds of cheese, none of which we call Swiss
Americans are very aggressive drivers
Courtesy for fellow motorists seems to not exist
Everyone everywhere goes considerably over the posted speed limit, even when police are present
I never figured out what the rush was or the reason for the "me first" attitude when driving
Perfectly friendly people turn into raving lunatics behind the wheel
People wear shoes inside their homes
So strange
Coffee is a crime against humanity
I think of it as brown colored breakfast water
Don't get me started on chocolate and cheese
American breakfast is massive
Delicious, but too much food
Restaurants are always focused on rushing people in and out rather than the enjoyment of the guests
The country is vast and covers many different climates and biomes, yet it is also shockingly the same
One can be at the Wal-Mart in Juneau Alaska or Portland Maine and see the same products
The plazas contain the same stores, with only some regional variation
It is really weird how similar the feel of it all is
even when the people and landscape are different
Americans have weird race issues
People who live in the same town, have kids in the same school, like the same sports teams, and work in the same company can see themselves as more aligned with me as a white Swiss person than their neighbors that are black or hispanic
I never quite understood what drove the divide, as it seems to exist even with people who never seemed to be particularly racist to me
Time is a relative thing there
Swiss arrive when they are scheduled to do so
We wait outside for a party that starts at 7 pm, so we ring the door bell at 7
Not 8, or 6:45, precisely 7
We would rather stand outside in the rain than be early, or worse yet, late
We schedule everything, often a year in advance, and with great details
Americans see to just sort of "do stuff when they are ready". It is a big adjustment
In general, low price seems to be favored over high quality
A Swiss will spend 100 USD on a shovel and pass it on to his children, an American will buy a 10 USD shovel a dozen times in his life
Americans are shockingly open and friendly
It is terrifying at first
The generally are lovely, but I can see why they think we are cold
It took me years to understand things like small talk between strangers
Many times when I first arrived I thought people might be mentally ill, cult members, or trying to set me up for a crime
lol
Weird customs about flags, patriotism, and such seem odd to an outsider
Swiss people like flags, and they are not uncommon, but we seem to have much less formality around rules and such for them
Why is tax not included in prices
Why is it withheld from pay checks and not just collected in bulk once a year
Why do you buy cars from a lot filled with cars and not order them from the factory
The same for furniture
Anyway, that is 15, and I could go on for days
In general, I liked living there
I don't want to give the impression of just complaining
It was a positive time for me, although I was also happy to move back home to Switzerland
Is that why I've seen memes about "your balls touching the water" before ??
Can confirm, I’m American-born Swiss and I never got used to La Bise
I hate it so much and i foster a secret candle of gratitude to covid for eliminating it
Switzerland here, and I’ve also noticed how dry it has been, but no one is talking about it
At least we’ve established some fire bans
... yes
I don't know if they really are old timey but names like Gervais or Ambroise for men and Ursule or Germaine for women feel like old names
That's for the French speaking part of Switzerland
"Fridulin" and "Flurina"
Malwine, Gesine, Philine are my favourite old-times German names
My offspring is named Henriette and Gustav
Not too modern either
Oh no this brought up memories from when I was 13 and went into starbucks claiming my name was Edeltraut
We thought it was hilarious
The cringe
In swiss german id just say Joseph and all its shorts for males (Sepp , Pepi etc)
I think also Regula for women
My uncles are Raymond and Denis, both born in the 50s. I know a boy whose name is Odilo, but we found that weird and his family is German-speaking
Nicole and Chantal were really popular around 1990 in German-speaking Switzerland
It reminds me of the names the native americans had, or at least in comics and movies
Also Kurt, short for Jokurt or Jogurt
Heidi
By 2050
Bold of them to assume we're still alive then
US: climate change isn't real lmao
Brazil: let the trees burn
It never happened to me but something that does happen quiet often is that I forget how to say something in French and can't remember immediately
Sometimes I have to think for like ten whole seconds or try to describe what I'm trying to say to the person I'm talking to
The highest mountain in Switzerland is the Dufourspitze, named after Guillaume Henri Dufour who was the General in the Sonderbund war, the last war Switzerland ever had
The Swiss have the highest chocolate consumption rate in the world, with about 10,3 kg per capita/year
Switzerland basically has seven presidents
It’s governed by a council of seven people, that take decisions by voting
Every year one of them is elected president of the council and therefore President of the Confederetion, but they do not have more power than the six other counsellors
Even though the official name of the country is the Swiss Confederation, Switzerland isn’t a confederation but a federation
Rumantsch, the fourth national language, was only recognized as such in 1938 in an effort to furthermore distinguish Switzerland from its troublesome neighbors at the time
One of the countries with the highest quality of life and also one of the most expensive places to live in
There are 208 mountains over 3000m high – with 24 of them over 4000m. The highest is Monte Rosa (Dufourspitze) at 4634m, situated on the Swiss/Italian border
We have four national languages: German, French, Italian, and Romansh
In the German part of Switzerland, *Swiss Standard German* is used as the written form, but in conversation and in casual texts/emails we communicate in *Swiss German* dialect
Assisted suicide is legal (EXIT reports over 1200 assisted suicides in 2018)
The highest railway station in Europe is in Switzerland, on top of the Jungfraujoch at 3454 meters
We have four official languages, that are all spoken in different parts of Switzerland: German, French, Italian and Romansh
Swissgerman is like a really really wild dialect of German, most Germans have trouble understanding it
Swissgerman has tons of Swiss dialects aswell though
Some can even be really really hard to understand for natives of other regions (for example Walliserdütsch)
Swissgerman has no grammatical rules, so the official language is just German
Our flag, unlike almost all others, is not rectangular but square
We‘re rumoured to be crazy rich, because on paper our salaries look like A LOT
In truth most people are just normal earners, everything is just so much more expensive here that our high salaries and high expenses balance themselves
We‘re surrounded by the European union on all sides (except for Liechtenstein which is tiny and which most people view as some sort of
„half-Switzerland“), and have our own currency in a huge sea of „Euroland“ around us
This and the what I mentioned in 4
results in tons of Swiss people shopping in Germany for anything from cars to everyday household necessities
doesn't liechtenstein also match the first criteria
Man I wanna come study in Denmark
Official government documents are always written in German, French, and Italian
But when you see official signs in public places such as railway stations, they're written in the local language first with maybe one or two other national languages and sometimes also in English
[some examples]
oops, that comment was hidden for me
Still an impressive fact
As a swiss i also understood it to some degree
Loved it tbh
No global warming
Wow
And the Netherlands is one of those countries where the damage will be quite big to say the least
And still people deny it smh
Yeah but I think you also go to prison if you protest against climate change, right
> Or, does the evil EU = Jews
All the same for them: Globalists = EU = Jews
There grill me one a stork
This is the best thing I've read all day
Unfortunately don't have gold to give but I'll drink a pint to you
He a painter by any chance
Alles klar Österreich
Apparently Italian officials pay as much attention to their tunnels as they do their bridges
Edit : too soon
He hasn't found his passion yet
Let's see what the future brings
Hey, I tried to pay one once, but the ink on the fine literally smudged so I couldn't read the bank transfer information
I tried contacting them by email a few times but never heard back
Edit : thinking about it, it was actually a toll bill as they wouldn't accept my maestro card when I tried to pass the gate
So it was a private company that bumbled it up, not the authorities
Things are not going as planned, thats quite unthinkable for a lot of the swiss people
We are pretty arrogant and i think this crisis will help us get back to earth
Not having to go to work
Man, we are no where near as prepared or ready as we should be
And why aren't we testing more people
It's not like our gouvernement doesn't have the money
And why wasn't military aid engaged two weeks ago
The stereotype of us being slow is really taking shape
It’s not just that, but it seems many people just act like it’s not that bad
I had to go out today, in Lausanne there were people everywhere in town, just casually hanging out
It really looked like a regular Monday, not what I expected
Now our big plan to all retreat in our bunkers in the mountains in case of war seems just very unrealistic
People are retarded
The media and gouvernement have not been able to get through to them
It's frustrating
Not at all no
But it may be because I’ve been wanting to visit for quite some time now, so if anything I think about it maybe more than other European countries
Being in the EFTA together it might also come up a little more often in the news here
That being said, I don’t feel like I tend to forget about any country in Europe at all anyway
( citizen here) Yes, I will support any initiative to develop a better railway network across Europe
Hey I did the whole Sweden by train this year (actually Zürich-Hamburg-Kopenhagen-Luleå-Haparanda/Tornio-Kemi-Kolari-Helsinki-Stockholm-Gdansk-Warsaw-Zürich by trains and ferries)
That was a lot of fun
You're missing out
Traveling by train is the best way of traveling
Trains are not only much more environmental friendly than options you listed, they are also more safe and more comfortable
I wish Europe taxed airlines out of short-haul business and used that money to develop railway network
Please don't be offended, but that's more like a French problem than a railway problem
I made a mistake of booking a flight with a layover in Paris and guess what happened
100% agreed
i look for swiss comments and while scrolling always accidentally stop at the danish ones
How well can you relate to the Swiss comments
I remember in one of my first English lessons learning the words for furniture, and thinking they all sounded terrible and couldn’t believe they actually meant something; especially chair, wardrobe and furniture
Sausage
It sounds like sauce and just doesn't evoke the mental image of a Wurst
Idk this word just frustrates me

I remember in one of my first English lessons learning the words for furniture, and thinking they all sounded terrible and couldn’t believe they actually meant something; especially chair, wardrobe and furniture
Also the same meaning in French
I’ve just noticed, no idea what happened
Nah its not closer
In norwegian you pronounce it literally the same like in english
But we do also say Spanish to describe people—just only as an adjective
As a noun, it can only refer to the language
He is Spanish
He speaks Spanish
He is a Spaniard
Tbh, I don’t think I have ever called anyone a Spaniard before
It sounds really old-fashioned to me, like Don Quixote or something
I would probably say something like, “He’s Spanish, from Barcelona
not shorts but i wear t-shirts all year round, even when im skiing
To a degree, yes
Switzerland has a very complicated relationship towards Germany that can probably best be described as hate-love
This is particularly curious because Germans generally love Swiss people and every German I've met (both in Switzerland and abroad) has been super kind to me
I think the inconvenient truth is probably that Swiss people have a bit of an inferiority complex and the fact that literally hundreds of thousands of Germans have flocked into Switzerland during the past 20 years hasn't exactly made this easier
Our far-right party SVP actually proposed banning Germans from entering the country at one point
not in the way most people would think, but there is a kind of discontent towards Germans, similar to how walloons don't like the French
it's a general kind of "they see us as an extension of their country, so we don't like them" vibe
(not saying that Germans do)
My friends all for some reason do not like germans (theyre swiss) and when asked why, they give these same answers "Theyre unfriendly, humor-less" etc
But personally every german I met was very kind and I had fun talking to them
We basically "hate" the Germans as much as we "hate" the French
Actually, in Romandie we "hate" the French much more than the Germans
The swiss on the other side of the Röstigraben deal with the Germans, we handle the French
Honestly don't know what the swiss across the alps think of Italy though
> the fact that literally hundreds of thousands of Germans have flocked into Switzerland during the past 20 years hasn't exactly made this easier
I think the job market plays a big role in this relationship
This Germany-Switzerland relationship is only true for the north-eastern cantons
For everybody else in Switzerland, Germany isn't any more a special neighbour than Italy, France or Austria
Well, the joke here goes: the Habsburgs originated from the still existing [Habsburg] so their true ancestry is Swiss ;)
^(This of course completely ignores the fact that the Habsburg was not on Swiss territory back then
That happens to anybody who doesn't have the license plates of the canton they're in, tbh
Lol I'm very sorry about that
Unfortunately, it's only too well imaginable
Here in the french speaking region we love to hate on France, like teasing a sibling you know ? I definitely feel a closer connection to France than any other neighbour of ours, and I feel like it’s the same for the Swiss-germans and Germany
Lol I completely have to agree with you about the Eastern European thing, even though it might upset some people here
As for the "unfriendly" part
this sentiment (in Switzerland) is actually the result of an unfortunate cultural misunderstanding
A lot of Germans who come to live in Switzerland arrive here with very little prior knowledge of what the culture and *mentality* are like
Somewhat ignorantly, they usually assume that it's basically the same as back home, just that everything's a bit smaller
I can understand why they would make this assumption but unfortunately for them, it is very wrong
As many Germans have to find out as they begin to live here, Swiss culture and especially Swiss mentality can be quite different from German mentality
One great example for this is communication
Germans are known for their very direct and straight-forward style of communicating
To be clear, I'm not putting any value judgment on this, I'm just pointing it out
Meanwhile, Swiss people communicate extremely indirectly; to the point where even my Korean wife sometimes complains that Swiss people act too "Japanese", aka too indirect
Contrary to German people who simply tell you what's up, Swiss communication is built on a ton of detours, conditionals, politeness markers etc
The aim is to make the other person feel as comfortable as possible and to avoid conflict at all costs
For listeners, meanwhile, this means that they often have to read between the lines to understand what is actually being said
Just a few days ago, my wife told me about a situation at her job where her German boss wanted to take on extra work for the group and one of her Swiss colleagues tried to explain why this isn't possible
What the colleague actually meant to say was that the group is currently overworked with other projects but instead of saying this, she went on a long, meandering explanation about financial resources etc
A Swiss boss would've probably guess what she's *really* trying to say but the German boss instead answered after 10-15 minutes: "Alles klar, du überlegst es dir also noch
" This showed how she completely misread the situation
She interpreted the Swiss employee's lengthy explanation as a sign of uncertainty, when in reality, it was a very polite way of saying "no, we can't do that right now
The irony of this situation was that the German boss probably would've been 100% cool with a straight-forward answer
She may even have *preferred* such an answer
But the Swiss employee was not able to provide such an answer
They were both stuck in their culture's perspectives
Oftentimes, freshly immigrated Germans make remarks towards their Swiss coworkers or friends (or even strangers) that are viewed as extremely rude by these Swiss people
In reality, the Germans almost never intend to be rude
It's just the way they're used to talk to people from back home
Unfortunately, a lot of Swiss people don't realize these statements to be unfortunate faux-pas and instead they misinterpret them as unfriendly, rude, obnoxious etc
This is particularly unfortunate for the Germans because politeness is considered so important in Switzerland
So, that's where the "unfriendly"-stereotype comes from
Yes, but the Romandie's view of France is still more distant and reserved than how the north-eastern cantons view Germany
Nobody calls France the "big canton", or something of that sort
Idk Dutch tourists are my personal favorites when working as a server, they are direct but leave you for the most alone and don't try to be funny or make too many questions
Your hooligans on the other hand
I thought Bugatti was Italian until recently
And for some reason they have really weird add campaigns in Switzerland with a guy dressing up as a women(not that there is something wrong with that)
Asked my Japanese cousin what a Superdry jacket a stranger was wearing had written on it
Car
Gasoline
Tires
Racing
Likewise, all the Street Fighter moves are hilariously cheesy when translated literally
MOVING AIR PUNCH
TORNADO WHIRLING KICK
DRAGON PUNCH
Agreed, fuck Mateschitz
Wait til you find out that the Italian version tastes 100X better
Same, except I speak french and learning that those obviously french princesses weren’t french was just weird
> Yeah I mean maggi is synonymous with meaning instant noodles in South Asia
So you're telling me that a Swiss company is selling 90% of all instant noodles in southern asia, but i can't find any of these prodcuts in Switzerland ....
Yet funnily enough, here Milka isn’t really big I find
From a Swiss point of view it looks like a german knock-off of Swiss brands
For real
Ah makes sense then
I almost exclusively drink tap water and I think most people do this
Furthermore, when I am in another (European) country where tap is considered safe, I always drink a glass on arrival
It's kind of a ritual for me
It's actually common
I prefer personally water from the supermarket as I don't like the taste of our tap water
Because where I live the tap water comes from an area with many chalk in the ground/mountain and it gets the taste of it
But I don't mind if there's only tap water around
Here tap water is so good it's not only found in taps
You can actually drink from almost every fountain
Doesn't matter if in the city or on top of a mountain, you see a fountain thingy you can drink from it
If it's unsafe to drink there will be a sign (for example toilets on trains)
Yup, comes straight from the glaciers where I'm from
The only times I buy bottled water is if I want flavoured water
For sparkling water I use one of those soda stream things with tap water
My wife and I almost exclusively communicate in English because she comes from South Korea
Although her German is very good by now, we somehow never managed to switch over
After all, English was the language we spoke from the very beginning of our relationship, when she didn't know any German and I didn't know any Korean
Due to this, there are days when I do all of my talking in English and don't speak a single word of Swiss
It's even more common these days with Covid and both of us being home often
I also studied English at university, so there used to be days when I would talk in English to my wife, only to go to uni and continuing speaking English to other people, and come back home to my wife again
After many years of doing this, my brain is so set on English that I often forget about Swiss words and can only remember the English one
In fact, what's more extreme is that oftentimes when I do talk in Swiss to my family or a friend, an English word or phrase slips out before I consciously notice it
This happens especially when I'm very animated about a topic and I talk quite fast
Just the other day, I was talking to my doctor when I accidentally said "y'know" and just a few moments later "basically". These are classic brain farts; I don't deliberately throw these words into my Swiss conversations because I want to sound cool
In fact, it can be quite embarrassing when the person doesn't know me well and doesn't know my backstory
I've had some people give me stares because they probably thought I wanted to show off or be some sort of hipster
In reality, I simply can't help it
My brain gets confused constantly switching between 2 languages, so these things just slip out
It's even worse for my wife who on some days switches back and forth between 3 languages, for example when she talks to me in English, to people at work in German and to her friends back home on the phone in Korean
My wife and I both do a lot of code-switching (as it is correctly called in linguistics)
Sometimes I also can't think of an English word and randomly throw in a German one
What's particularly fascinating to me from a linguistic standpoint is that we seem to have certain languages allocated to certain themes or word classes
For example we use a lot of Korean words to express feelings and physical sensations (being sleepy, hungry, happy, sad, annoyed etc)
We often use Swiss or German for nouns
I haven't quite figured out why we do this and whether it's just us or whether it says something about those languages but it's an interesting phenomenon in my opinion
It usually happens when talking about a specific topic I learned about in English because I never heard the German words to begin with
This is pretty much the same in reverse
I suppose it would be the same with French but I usually don't really learn about things in French
flushing the toilet after 10pm if you live in a appartment(it was even written in our contract)
mowing the lawn on a sunday, someone(only swiss) will call the police
Same here but only in rural areas
In the city everyone will stare at you
It seems that it’s unacceptable in most cold countries
Youre all Swabians to us
Huere sau schwabe
The first one is so relatable
It's even worse for us since most people that guess your nationality when they hear you speak german go from biggest to smalles so it's always Germany -> Austria -> Switzerland
Literally the Nr
1 reason our Nation exists is that we didn't want to be  part of any of our neighbouring countries
You got the beer
We got the chocolate
Deal
My pulse just went up to 200 for a split second, so
well done :-D
I mean ill say it swiss german so we will see
I guess monarchs
But thats quite a stretch of swiss history
I mean it's still German
If you understand it you definitly know that it's German
But to German speaking folks it sounds weird

I'm by no means a historian, but I'm pretty sure both Romansh and Ladino developed from the spoken Latin used during the time of the Roman Empire
Over the centuries they became less and less important and got replaced by older versions of German, French and Italian and are nowadays only found in some smaller regions
It's quite interesting, because without the Government trying to keep it alive (which they do for Romansh), it would most likely vanish completely in the next dozen generations or so
It's funny how you struggle with Bavarian and it's fairly understandable for most german speaking Swiss
As said its a big stretch especially regarding swiss history aswell
According to UNICEF, Switzerland was ranked the least family friendly country in Europe
Nah, the Burgundians and Savoyards are pretty chill about it
Yeah any war that involved Switzerland happened way too long ago for anyone in their right mind to care about
Like in Geneva they still celebrate their victory against the Savoyards back in 1602 in a tradition called "L’Escalade", but I’ve never seen a french person take it personally, that would just be weird
Could be discussed really
Raclette is apparently from the 1300s (source: Wikipedia), and at that time Savoy was much bigger, holding parts of modern-day western Switzerland
So Raclette is from Savoy, from a territory that is today divided between France and Switzerland, I suppose
(Username checks out)
No, I’m pretty convinced cheese fondue is more of a swiss thing
I’ll try my best;
For fondue you put lots of cheese in some kind of bowl, melt it, and then you eat it by sticking a peace of bread on the end of a stick, and putting the bread in the cheese
Image:  . We often eat pickles and tea with it
For raclette, there’s different ways of cooking it
My way is buying a pack of sliced cheese, then putting the cheese on a mini-frying pan (from a raclette kit, or whatever you call it), waiting until the cheese melts then put the melted cheese on a potato
We often eat ham etc (“charcuterie”, I have no clue how to say that in English

Who denies this
This is taught in history lessons here in Switzerland
Our Government decided to stop accepting any refugees in 1942 since they feared a german invasion if they kept accepting more Jews and Gypsies
I alwasy thought bad about this especially since my great-grandmother was a refugee who fled Germany before WW2 when Hitler rose to power
I wish they had the balls to accept refugees too, but saying our Government denies this to this day is simply not true
What you are referring to are the court cases probably
I know about some kind of fondue with meat, but it is more like cheese fondue: you put the meat at the end of a stick, put it in a kind of bowl, and let it boil for a while
(Fondue bourguignonne)
We use our kit maybe four, five times a year at most, and only for melting cheese, so I understand your surprise
But I don’t have any answers to your question unfortunately, we could just as well go without a raclette kit that you may consider as a wasted investment
But I definitely don’t regret it, I had such great raclette nights with friends, I think winter wouldn’t really feel like winter for me without a raclette
If any of the diet and weather comments were true switzerland wouldnt be anywhere near these countries, which it is
I feel like the work ethic in some jobs here could easily give people burnouts or heart attacks
Only if it's above the limit where it goes to court (25km/h iirc)
Again, god bless America
We have something called Maturastreich and its a whole event the last grade of our Highschool(Gymnasium/Kantonsschule) can plan and mess with the teachers and students, even the principale
We do
On our last official school week before our secondary education graduation exams we do all sorts of weird stuff
That includes some sort of over the top dress code every day, riding around with kick scooters and shooting others with water guns (although that's now restricted inside the hallways for obvious reasons)
During this week we also have the "Maturagag" (matura being the exit exam) which is a show organised by the graduating classes where some students are teamed up with teachers to complete disciplines like bobby car racing and other quite hilarious stuff
To top it all off there is the LSD ("Last School Day") where everyone is just partying around, dressing up crazily and all that stuff
Bare in mind that all of that happens before the exams even start lol
The Matura is the exam you do at the end of Highschool comparable to the German Abitur
I was thinking of Die Hard as well
The other guys are Georgian, so to me it'd make sense that they sound different
Granted I don't speak the language, so maybe it should be more similar to standard Russian
most definitely
in villages and on the countryside you always greet another
less so in cities or crowded places
Of course, it goes like "zi" - "zi"
(because it's just "Grüezi" but especially when hiking that "Grüe" often gets replaced by a breath)
Yes
And even one step further, dont use the formal greeting, use the informal one
In the mountains there's no need to be formal, everybody is your friend
(Just a short hello while passing, not stopping and talking for 5mins of course)
I have never heard the „1000m rule“ even tho I practically grew up nex to the austrian border (and in the mountains)
How cool
Idk if it‘s valid over here, Swiss people are pretty reserved
I‘d hope it was thogh, it‘s a very cool rule
Came here to say this
And we don‘t just use this on mountains, in the smaller villages it is common practise to say „Grüezi“ (or, just „zi“, accompanied by a minimal nod) whenever you meet someone/pass someone by, even if you happen to pass each other by on the town square
This is only valid for one on one or small groups meeting (like a group of friends passing by a family or sth like that), as soon as there are larger groups of people greeting is only necessary when you meet sbdy you know
But not greeting sbdy you pass by on an empty vilage road is regarded as rude
Source: Grew by up in a village, got reprimanded by my parents for not greeting
Whenever I hike outside of Switzerland, I need to keep reminding myself that I should say "hi" or a local equivalent and not "Grüezi".
But then for words like "Hi", "Thank you", "sorry" the tone and facial expression are more important than the language, so maybe it doesn't really matter
Not only in small villages
In Thalwil (pop 20k suburb of Zürich) everyone does that
My observation is that you say "Grüezi" if you pass by at most one person per minute
That‘s fair, I think you are right
I‘d say your rule applies eveywhere except maybe the actual cities, partly bc there you usually just pass too many people
Idk
the villager in me would also want to say „Grüezi“ if I met another lone soul alone at Zürich Central
Paying supermarket cashiers 20-25 CHF an hour (Around 18-23 EUR)
Schöni Wiehnachte
Wait so
if you say "splitting costs", are you talking about splitting them evenly or everyone paying the exact amount for which they ate
For example in a group of 5 friends every person pays 20% or every person pays the exact amount they owe
In (French speaking) Switzerland we refer to a "douche portugaise" (Portuguese shower) on the same way
I think something being glossed over here is suspension of all elections and referendums while the order is in effect, except the order has no expiration
Effectively he rules by decree and cannot by removed by election while he rules by decree
Kind of a tough situation to be in as a Hungarian, because as long as Orban rules by decree, you effectively do NOT live in a democracy, and who knows how long Orban will choose to make that last
[This] CNN article is where I understood there to be no elections, though a different article did say he could cancel them if he wanted
Is there something I'm missing here
I understand
I've got a similar problem with U.S. media whenever they exaggerate something Trump did, it just adds more fuel to the "fake news" fire
There's already enough shit you can call Trump on, there's no need to make anything up
Gopfeseckel etz hörsch aber
I speak Solothurnisch/Berndeutsch and my friend from München (has only been once in Switzerland) understands me just fine
Random question but: Is it just me or does Torbjörn from Overwatch not really have a swedish accent
I've never heard any swedish People talk with his accent before
It's def easier to read
I think a main hurdle is how much we merge words: e.g. the phrase "kannst du mir"/"kannste mir" is simply abbreviated to "chaschmr" (yes, not even a schwa)
The singular-formal version in Western dialects would be "chötdrmr" -- "könnt Ihr mir", although in the Eastern and Basel dialects it would be something more discernible like "chönnt si m(ə)r" -- "können Sie mir".
Pronouns in general are often hidden in word endings like that
We also simplify some other propositions/articles, like "das" becomes "z" or "die" -> "d", "an der" -> "ar".  I guess these can be overheard by non-trained speakers
The latter is especially interesting because in standard German the final R becomes (nearly) a vocal sound, whereas in Swiss German it's a very hard R -- the connection isn't immediately clear in spoken speech
Another curiosity is how word-initial "gg" is an actual sound here
"ggsee" (gesehen, saw) and "gsee" (sehen, seeing) are two different words
These shortenings are the main reason why a Swiss German sentence doesn't map 1:1 to a Standard German one, even if none of the words are different
I was told you have to learn to not become a garbage man
Even though it is absolutely essential
Don‘t judge people by their profession, judge them by their behavior
In North America, garbage workers are paid more than teachers
I love the fact that PlayMobil has a [garbage truck] in their line up
This is so wholesome
I wish you both only the very best
What even is the "académie français"?
I just wanted to say "Nénufar" shouldn't have been accepted AT ALL
And that's when my respect for these old people went down the drain
This being put aside, they kinda look like ""stylish"" government people, I can get why people would think that, if they didn't know what they are supposed to do ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Thats so stupid
It is clearly serbian gangsters who abduct people not albanian ones
I relate to this, having multiple languages seem to really confuse foreigners
One time in Geneva a guy asked me if I spoke spanish because we speak so many languages in Switzerland
that’s not how it works
Pretty sure I wouldn't survive summer without white wine and beer so I totally agree
>Eine allgemeine Impfpflicht ist mit dem Gesetz aber nicht verbunden
Ungeimpfte Kinder können auch nicht von der Schule ausgeschlossen werden
- tagesanzeiger
Seems like they will still be able to attend school as long as they pay the fine
While 2500 Euros sure is a hefty fine, I can see some entitled parents paying this so their kids can still attend school
Was not expecting that
Had an out loud chuckle at this :D
Sounds like they wanted an aggressively masculine rebranding of what used to be called a “fanny pack
And I think that’s beautiful
Even though we had a lot of rain and thunderstorms last night, it's still super hot
I get that we're almost in July but it could be a bit colder, i'm sweating constantly
I definitely regretted walking in the sun to avoid taking public transport the other day
Thankfully so far the nights are still below 20°C so it’s pretty comfortable
As long as I avoid direct sunlight, I’m actually enjoying this weather
I think i'll be fine haha just not a hot weather type of person
Oh god, I dread the nights where it doesn‘t go below 20°C.
I heard the same about Switzerland multiple times
And many kids learn how to ski at a very young age
The joke told is that kids learn to ski before the can walk
Unrelated but my grandmother once won a set of silver cutlery in a rabbit breeding contest
I grew up in her house so I've literally had a silver spoon in my mouth for al long as I can remember lol
That's actually a good question, because I feel like an outsider when visiting the French or Italian part of Switzerland
Sometimes feels like i'm not even in the same country
But it's a bit different for me since, although I was born here and grew up here, my parents are both Portuguese so that also comes into play
But I would still say that I just feel Swiss
Not being able to understand one or two national languages is just part of growing up here lol
As Swiss citizen my first "allegiance" is to my home canton
within Switzerland I'm "Bernerin / Bärnerin" (citizen of Bern) first, Swiss second
The same applies to the language
It's "Berndeutsch / Bärndütsch" for me, not "Swiss German", bcs it's my dialect
"I use the term "Swiss-German" only with foreigners
Abroad, I'm Swiss (even with my dual citizenship)
No chance explaining to foreigners that I feel more comfortable calling myself "Bernerin" than Swiss
I believe most Swiss feel like that
Switzerland might be a small country but it is a confederarion and a nation of will
The modern state only exists since 1848 and this only as a result of Napoleon reshaping Europe (which I think had been necessary)
But it can't erase hundreds of years of  independence
There are no Swiss inside of Switzerland
There are only Lausanners, Genèvans, Fribourgers, Berners, Valaisans, Lucerners, and so on and so forth
Swiss here
I mostly feel like a European
I could never imagine feeling German
That's just not who I am, and I don't even speak German
I do feel Swiss, but in practise I only feel Swiss when I'm in the German speaking part of the country
i feel swiss and i think les romandes aussi
Naaah I feel Swiss, but I always mention I'm from Tessin (Italian speaking region)
Still I also speak quite good french and German so I don't have communication problems with other swizzies
People in Switzerland (especially in Tessin) need to do an additional effort and properly learn at least another national language, otherwise sometimes we look like dumbasses who can't communicate and need to fallback to English
About Italy; I do not feel closer to Italian people
I feel closer to the Swiss-Germans and the Graubündern (Swiss-German / rumantsch):  we have similar habits, point of views ecc
As soon as you cross the border from Tessin to Italy, everything is so different
You see that they are not the same country and people are so different despite speaking the same language
PS: just so you know Tessinern are a very proud population
They get very offended if you call them Italians
&#x200B;
Also, funny thing: I was born in Croatia from a Bosnian-Croat father and a Serbian-Bosnian mother
When I explain my origins I just say Bosnia lol, but also I never really identified with that culture down there except for the communal part of it
That's something you hardly find in Switzerland
You know the feeling of having a little brother/sister that you don't have that much in common with in everyday life
In the end they're still family and you are still happy to visit, spend time with them and are proud of their achievements
Even if they might be different in some things or have completely different opinions, you like them nevertheless
This is how I feel about other parts of Switzerland
Not only other language parts, but all other parts than the few small villages I grew up in
Those villages will forever be where I'm truly from, just like your parents always stay your parents
And all the other parts of Switzerland are like little siblings to me, we're family
And Europe is like the weird aunt that wants to convert you to veganism but you only see her on special holidays so don't worry about her too much, you can ignore her for most of the year and be just fine
I was born in Germany and grew up in Switzerland
I don't feel like either of them but the actual Swiss people in Switzerland do feel Swiss
But someone from the German part of Switzerland doesn't feel like part of the French part and vice versa
>Sometimes feels like i'm not even in the same country
Same
Just feels like a different country where my mobile plan works, and I recognize the stores (Coop, Migros, UBS, etc)
It's interesting because I watched a Switzerland v. Ireland World Cup qualifier in Geneve, and no one knew the lyrics to the National Anthem
I mean, the majority of the Portuguese population in Switzerland lives in Romandie (largest being in Vaud, with 40'000, 5% of the canton's total population), so I'm not sure on how that would make you feel more of an outsider here than in Germanic Switzerland
But I'm not in your situation or have your life experiences, so I'll take your word on it :)
Personally, when I go to Germanic Switzerland, I still feel at home, but like, different ? I think the best way to illustrate my feeling would be like a full life city guy going to farming country, or a valley in the mountains
Still home, but a bizzaro version of home
I would say that (as a non-native who is doing her best to integrate), I feel "Swiss German" (is that even a thing
), and then Swiss
I say this because once I cross that Röstigraben, I no longer feel quite so connected to my countrymen
But yet I feel closer to them than if I just crossed the border into France
yup
i consider myself swiss in general (like an umbrella term sort of) but in Switzerland i’m from my canton
I dont think thats a majority opinion here
Meh, Swiss for me
We're a bit too different with things like the EU for us to say we're European in my opinion
I don't think that's what OP meant
In the title I'm pretty sure s/he meant "German-speaking Swiss", emphasis on the hyphen
Not knowing the lyrics of the national anthem unites the swiss of all language regions
I feel plenty at home all over switzerland, especially when compared to visiting a neighbour country
I think there's also a difference between going to a 'German' city that's in a bilangue canton (eg
Bern) or a city that can't be further from the Romandie (idk, Zürich
Gallen
While I barely speak French and understand only the basics, I interact with Welsche almost on a daily Basis (live in Bern)
Not from Ticino but I think most Swiss-<blank> have affinities towards their language <country> when it comes to random things
Like I found out a lot of Swiss Germans support the German National team in the World Cup, Swiss-Italians Italy, and Swiss-French France
Geneva was buzzing with French support during the most recent World Cup/Euros for example
You'd have to ask someone from Ticino ... Language-wise, there's barely any difference, but I don't know if there's big differences in culture between Ticino and Italy
I think they also feel more Swiss than Italian, but it'd be still interesting to know
No I agree with you
While I might have more in common with you culture and language wise, I would probably go to war with you the moment you attack any of my fellow countrymen, roman or ticinese
Iu, ds hani ou scho so erläbt
It's one country, but it's a federation of cantons, similar to the USA
I guess it can very loosely be compared to how Scotland, Wales and England together form Britain
The head of government is a council of seven called the Federal Council
They take decisions together
There is no single person like the British PM
There is a president of the council but he or she has no more powers than the others, it's mostly so presidents from other countries can meet with someone called president as well
Definitely not in the countryside but I think it's not that uncommon in Zurich, Berne, Geneva, Basel
My life is more similar to someone's who lives in any other European city than someone's who lives 15km far away in a suburb
The fact that we're not in the EU doesn't really come up in daily life
Nevertheless, that's probably also why I really see the benefit of getting closer to the EU
I understood it as in culturally close to the Germans
Guess I worded it weirdly
Yeah, speaking another language for me doesn't mean we're from different countries
Even the German dialects aren't the same and we still group them all together as if the Swiss German part was one homogeneous region
Also about the anthem thing, our anthem isn't as present in our daily lifes as it is in other countries
Among other reasons, national Symbols are important especially for big countries that depend on them to assure national unity
The US is a prime example for this
Switzerland feeds it's patriotism in different ways, but at the same time it puts a lot of emphasis on regional autonomy
Yeah I definitely feel Swiss
Of course I feel closer to other french speakers than german/italian/rumantsch, simply because we mix more for work, studies, etc
We’re divided into cantons, but there is no superior administrative entity we could identify with that would rule over each languages as a whole
I think in that sense that the language barrier is more superficial than anything
To give some context to others, our national anthem is widely disliked because we feel its ultra-pious content is exceedingly awkward and doesn't fit our modern character any longer (didn't even when it was adopted)
We even held multiple contests the last couple decades to select a new anthem
South African anthem is my favorite one for this reason
Always get goosebumps when they sing it before big Rugby matches
It's a common name for supermarket chain because they are supposed to work according to a cooperative scheme (not an economist, don't know the specifics)
But they are not all the same company across Europe
I must have lived in the wrong Switzerland in all those years
I have not met one swiss german who supports the German Nation team
As a guy with dual citizenship I was bullied for supporting Germany
They were supporting Paraguay if they ever played against Germany
Geneva is special because its considered to be basically French by the rest of Switzerland
I too wouldn't answer "Europe" because while I prefer it, that is more of a romantic/philosophical answer and they probably wouldn't expect such an answer, but more a matter-of-fact place of origin one
Could be because more people in larger cities have a European double citizenship
I... I just never heard it and disliked it when I did
So yeah, fuck the anthem ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
Over Switzerland, no they don't. But in my experience, they absolutely do root for Germany
I'm also talking the general world of sports
Like loads of Ligue 1 fans in Geneva, and I know loads of Bundesliga team fans in the Swiss German sides
Yes Switzerland is a Willensnation
Its not really the nationality that binds us togheter but the will to stand up for our values
No war is always better and you could make the argument that we are kind of experts in that field
:D Didnt want to seem hostile either
The argument of beeing not a united nation is just something we dont like if people bring it up
Gadaffi even proposed to split our nation at one time
That probably helps
For me personally it's the fact that my life is more similar to someone's who lives in any other European city than someone's who lives 15km far away in a suburb
Yeah, that's what I meant with other ways of promoting patriotism
You might have noted that we have the bright red flag everywhere, but they're very often together with the cantonal flags
The national anthem, however, is pretty much non present
I honestly can't remember the last time I heard it
In other countries you sing it every morning in school while putting up the national flag
Also we might have all those flags around but they are mostly decor, no one does anything actively with them
There's a difference between having flags around and singing an anthem, the second one needs a more active participation
My comment was more to answer why most Swiss don't know the lyrics of our anthem
(also the flags are mostly seen on tourist spots
Yes Bundesliga fans I agree
Borussia Mönchengladbach has a huge following in Switzerland, but when it comes to international games I often felt a lot of hate towards their language brothers
But maybe thats because I grew up in a more conservative part of the country
Yeah unfortunately the average swiss is rather hostime towards anything proposed  by foreigners
But the dynamic is slowly changing
The nationalist party is loosing more and more elections because people realize that we can only stay "rich" if we coorporate with other countries
Switzerland really does have a weird history compared to other european countries
We were founded as a union, and still kinda are one, but dislike the new union that have formed in the last centurie
(Out of the perspective of an average swiss, not mine)
In Switzerland, being crazy is illegal

* Seemingly every time I entered a restaurant in Mallorca I was greeted in German
Yeah I know it's the 17th Bundesland or whatever, but apart from speaking fluent Spanish I am also of Asian descent and don't speak a lick of German, so I found that a bit odd
Not to mention I had a lot of elder German couples wanting to speak to me (in German) about who knows what
* Was at a hostel in Barcelona and befriended a really nice German dude that had MS (multiple sclerosis) and had to use a wheelchair
I'm out on the plaza drinking a beer when he comes up to me and asks me if I want to (pinches his thumb and pointer finger) "smoke". Sure
I'm game
Lo and behold this guy is going around asking others to join, but not like other tourists, like
"locals". Spent the night drinking, smoking, and talking to a group that included a paraplegic, a drug dealer, and two prostitutes
I think Jesus would be proud of the sight
* Wanted to get the scoop from locals as to where to eat in Firenze, so I asked a kind looking Italian man if he recommended a place to eat
Looks at me
Dead pan serious
"la casa di mia mamma
" And no he wasn't inviting us over, he was just postulating for who knows why
By the way, this isn't the first time I've heard that answer
A lot of Italians answer the same way
Maybe not that strange, but still a bit of a culture shock I guess
This summer I went to Stockholm with my mother
One evening we decided to go to the cinema
The movie was at 8pm, and –as it is normal in Switzerland– we arrived about 15 minutes earlier
The staff seemed very surprised to see us so early, and indeed we were the very first
We awkwardly waited alone in the hall for the 15 minutes, and even when we were in the room there was almost no one
The movie started about 20 minutes late and people casually started arriving only during that time
I’m certain we didn’t get the time wrong, so I wonder if it’s just a known thing in Sweden that movies don’t start at the scheduled time
I was on holiday with my parents in Paris when I was 7, an English kid dressed in my Sunday Best with a beret on (obviously, because France)
We went on a Bateau Mouche  to take in the sights and no sooner had we boarded the boat, a huge group of Japanese tourists started taking photos of and with me
My parents found it hilarious and just let them think I was a French child and carry on snapping away
I sometimes wonder where the pictures are now
Had a similar experience at an AibBNB in Germany
We knew it was just a room in a large house but assumed the adjoining bathroom was for our private use
The house was huge and the hosts had bathrooms in their own bedroom
Anyways I'm in the bathroom brushing my teeth and the host casually walks in and starts brushing his teeth next to me
Like dude
at least wait until I'm done
Will add more as I think of them:
* Found the nightlife in Lisboa to be fantastic around the Bairro Alto, but the drug dealers are a bit
extreme
(eye contact)
Marijuana
(shake my head no and walk away)
Cocaina
HEROINA
* Took a family trip to China and the tour bus stopped by a massage place
No big deal, we could use a massage
Except, as soon as you walk in there was a staircase (one of those long circular ones) with scantily clad Chinese women waiting
The hosts asked us to pick one and she would take you to the massage area
Wait
what kind of family friendly massage is this again
17 year old me was quite
intimidated
Anyways, the foot massage was ok, but super awkward
But at one point she just started punching my shins with both fists
Over and over and over again
I started laughing in pain/nervousness and she kept going at it harder
Not fun
But it did feel better when she stopped so that's that
Kasper the "extra friendly" ghost
When I was in Greece it was Russian for me
But I guess that could make sense
For Switzerland: Ctrl+c followed by Ctrl+v.
I was in Copenhagen and a random man passed by on his bike to the cheers of a small crowd
Apparently the prince
I dont really feel sorry for anyone really
I guess i kinda feel bad for more alpine regions that have just become more or less tourist villiages or are solely dependent on tourism :/
And of course ticino, but more because they have to indure loads of swiss german tourists lul
We had a civil war in 1847, with the conservative cantons splitting from the rest and then being defeated
On most votes on the constitution, like the general revision in 1999, you can still see the divide
In total, about 100 men died in that war
I would be surprised if anyone knew anything about our country history beside that we were neutral during ww I and II
As for a major event I would say the battle of Moorgarten (Schlacht am Moorgarten), which is considered the first battle between the Confederates and the Habsburg
According to historians,  there's a very good chance that The Battle of Moorgarten never actually happened and is mostly legend
Edit : I'd say the fact that Switzerland had a civil war over religion and government centralisation is a big one that no one knows about
Sonderbund War
Really cool game, haven‘t gotten around to play it lately
The general of the confederacy (*ironically not the seperating party*) told his soldiers not to use explosive ammunition, only conventional rounds, as they were firing at the same guys they went to bootcamp together sometimes
It lasted less than a month and there was only one or two „major“ battles
Yeah, there were neutral cantons
Yeah, Swiss mercenaries were contracted a lot outside of Switzerland
It is said that they suffered a lot from being away from home, though  Their intense nostalgia was know as the Swiss Disease (Schweizerkrankheit)
I think there's this anecdote where certain songs were forbidden in France as the nostalgia would overtake the soldiers stationed there and make them desert
But honestly I don't know how true all of this is
Swiss being mercenaries should be well known
Or have you never asked yourself why the [Pope has Swiss Guards]
Or from French history there is this little episode:
> The assault on the Palace began at eight o'clock in the morning
As per the King's orders, the Swiss troops had retired into the interior of the building, and the defense of the courtyard had been left to the National Guard
The Marseillais rushed in, fraternized with the gunners of the National Guard, reached the vestibule, ascended the grand staircase, and called on the Swiss Guard to surrender
"Surrender to the Nation
", shouted Westermann in German
"We should think ourselves dishonored
" was the reply
"We are Swiss, the Swiss do not part with their arms but with their lives
We think that we do not merit such an insult
If the regiment is no longer wanted, let it be legally discharged
But we will not leave our post, nor will we let our arms be taken from us
Stubborn until death
Yepp, that's completely plausible
The people back at home thought this was such a cool way to go that they made the [Lion Monument]
Jup, it's a common ocurrence in our history, like the whole Tell affair or how supposedly they named Bern after the first aninal they hunted
I'm pretty sure it was more than three times, we might as well be invading Liechtenstein accidentally again right now as we talk
The « Swiss army invading Liechtenstein and coming back with a friend »-story is just a funny story we like to tell
In fact the Swiss army ensures the sovereignty of Liechtenstein as well, and they often have to pass through there
It’s not a rarity that Swiss soldiers find themselves on Liechtenstein soil
Doesn’t really qualify as « invasion ». There have been some incidents where they mistakenly fired into Liechtenstein though
Yeah, you're right
I mean there are quite a few things that happened, like the national strike is something we study too, but internationally there's really not that much that's relevant
"Maybe an epic cavalry charge
"No that's too unrealistic"
"What if we threw trees down our mountains at them
"Brilliant
Write that down
You just get lost
There's even a [wikipedia article ] about this
The Rhein lies between both countries all along their border
The free hour of parking you get during lunch time
But it usually comes with ice in the U.S
Good point
I have to disappoint you: linguistically, there is no language in the world whose features are entirely unique, aside from a few individual words
Even the most rare and strange linguistic characteristics are shared by at least a few obscure languages
Romanian is no exception
For example the feature that you present here is very common in English as well
"Speed" and "velocity" mean the same thing, except that the former has Germanic roots whereas the latter has Romance roots
The same goes for "freedom" and "liberty" or "alive" and "animate" or "wrath" and "ire" etc
English has thousands of word pairs like that
Add *-li* in German-speaking Switzerland to make almost everything small (just *-i* if the word ends in *l*. But beware, there are pitfalls, most words require to change a preceding Vocal (Umlaut) and even add some other letters, as in
Chübel -> Chübeli (bin)Muus -> Müsli (that's not your English edible Müsli, it's a mouse, of normal or small size, resp
Mues -> Müesli (that's your Bicher-Müesli)Schoggi -> Schöggeli (chocolate, piece of chocolate)Maa -> Männli (man)
It's distinct from German *-lein/-chen*. You can't say *Schokoladelein* to mean a piece of chocolate (*Schokolädchen* might work though, but I doubt it would be mentioned in a conversation), whereas *Schöggeli* is perfectly valid
Grammar in swiss german doesnt exist, and there is no correct way of saying or writing something
Definitly not no other language, but Swiss German doesn't have an official written form, everything is written in German
And if we write in Swiss German we just write how we think it's correct
Well, in Swiss German we have the "ch" which is pronounced like you're choking and trying to get something out of your throat, but I think Arabic languages have that too, not sure though
Some French speakers do that too: a quick inhalation on the word “ouais
Wouldn’t that just be “-chen” or “-lein” in German
Or is the difference that anything can be diminutive in Dutch, but only some things can be diminutive in German
I can guarantee you that the Basque language is no exception to this
Languages are human products and since humans around the world are creative and a common trait of human languages is that they need to be constructed in logical ways, you will always find the same trait or characteristic in more than one language
I don't speak Basque but as someone who has studied linguistics, I could give you features that are probably far rarer than anything Basque possesses and yet, these features can be found in other languages
For example clicking sounds are a very rare feature among the roughly 6,000 languages spoken on Earth
Yet, there is an entire group of such languages called "bantu". One of them is Xhosa, another one is Ta'a. There's also a language spoken in Mexico where speakers are unable to use words like "left" or "right". They only use absolute (cardinal) directions such as "east" or "west". Rather than saying "you are standing to the left of me", these people would say "you are standing south-east to me". Now, this is an incredibly rare and odd linguistic feature but even this exists somewhere else, namely in a few aboriginal languages spoken in Australia
I think that decisions affecting public health should be approached by consulting science
Many scientific research communities and research societies  have publicly spoken out against permanent daylight-saving time (pDST) and in favor of standard time (ST, "wintertime")
From a joint statement of the European Sleep Research Society, European Biological Rhythms Society and the Society for Research on Biological Rhythms:
>We would like to emphasize that the scientific evidence presently available indicates that installing permanent Central European Time (CET, standard time or ‘wintertime’) is the best option for public health
The European Biological Rhythms Society further writes:
>ST improves our sleep (1) and will be healthier for our heart (2) and our weight (3)
The incidence of cancer will decrease (4), in addition to reduced alcohol- and tobacco consumption (5)
People will be psychologically healthier (6) and performance at school and work will improve (7)
The Society for Research on biological rhythms concludes:
>We therefore strongly support removing DST changes or removing permanent DST and having governing organizations choose permanent Standard Time for the health and safety of their citizens
The American Academy of Sleep Medicine further says:
>It is the position of the AASM that the U.S. should eliminate seasonal time changes in favor of a national, fixed, year-round time
Current evidence best supports the adoption of year-round standard time, which aligns best with human circadian biology and provides distinct benefits for public health and safety
There are some other aspects that politicians and citizens may also consider, e.g. safety, commercial activity or recreational activity, but science related to sleep and biological rhythms  - with a focus on public health - is pretty clear on that end
>I don't believe in this squabble about "natural" time
It's called science, you either accept it or deny it

You are not weird at all, the influence of natural light as a "zeitgeber" is well established in science
Scientific research communities in those areas are in favor of establishing permanent standard time ("Winter time") for exactly those reasons
So, people in here asking for summer time because they "enjoy more sun after work" are comparable to people who say that the like climate change because they enjoy walking around in shorts and flip flops all year round
They just ignore the problem at hand and the scientific evidence
>for a day but not in average for the week (which suggest that people who would have gotten a heart attack anyways just got it a few days earlier)
i) that still indicates that changing to summertime puts the body under stress
ii) the same studies also show that the risk of heart attacks drops after the change back to standard time in winter, indicating that the body never fully adapted to summertime
iii) it's about the mismatch of the circadian clock and social clock
Our body never fully adapts to summertime, e.g. cortisol metabolism has been shown to adapt by only 2 minutes instead of 60 minutes, leaving the body under constant stress
You are right, this isn't rocket science if people would care to read up about the topic before they comment
So, are you arguing to start schools eg at 9
00 instead of 8
00 and at the same time to move clocks forward from 8
00 to 9
You would cancel out any positive effect a later start of school and work day would have
You are missing the point: *even if* the weekly heart attacks wouldn't change overall, the results show that the body reacts to subtle changes on clock time, e.g. by disrupting sleep quality, which can lead to negative health outcomes
Furthermore, Sleep quality remains adversely affected during summertime, this has been shown again and again, e.g. more "social jet-lag" in summertime
Social jet-lag has been connected to adverse health effects
That being said, other studies show higher heart attack risk after change to DST for the full week (and lower risk after change back to standard time)
"Start's much too early" - but at the same time, you support summertime
It's tough to have a meaningful discussion with someone who doesn't seem to understand the absurdity of those two positions in connection to each other
No, it's you who doesn't understand the study
Cortisol peak levels were *later* by 58 minutes, referring to clock time, so e.g. at 7:58 summertime vs
7:00 standard time
7:58 summertime corresponds to 6:58 standard time
Hence, the body adapted by 2 minutes
If the body would have adapted by 58 minutes, cortisol peak levels would be at 7
02 summertime, which corresponds to 6
02 standard time
They even explicitly mention in the study how they showed that the time of sunrise and not clock or awakening times is the determining factor for cortisol levels
>For half a year: yes
For the other half year the time doesn't change so the effect is positive
That depends on what system we are talking about: If we talk about permanent summertime, then it would be the same in one half of the year and worse in the other compared to the current system
If we talk about the current system, where we keep switching between standard time and summertime, then yes it would be the same during summertime and better in winter
However, the best option would still be to use permanent standard time ("wintertime"), as then it would be better all year round
Additionally, there is evidence that the body never adapts to the time change during the months of summertime, e.g. in Australia during a permanent summer time trial the cortisol levels adjusted for 2 minutes, instead of a full hour
Cortisol levels are involved in the wake response and are thought to prepare the body for energy consumption and stress
Furthermore, studies have shown the connection of (permanent) summertime and the phenomenon "social jetlag" and the connection of "social jetlag" and depression and seasonal mood changes
But I'm definitely not going to start discussing anecdotal evidence, that's not science but personal opinions
I just used that time as an example
There is no standard starting time, as there is no unified school system in Switzerland, rather various regional systems
In my case, and this is a few years back, starting time would usually be between 7
30 to 8
00, depending on which level of school
>And yes, it's anecdotal, but most people I know prefer summer time
The funny thing is that many people say that - until they experience permanent summertime in winter:
e.g. in the US there was one year of permanent summertime in the 70ies
Initially, the support was around 80%, after the first winter that support dropped to 40%. Similarly, in different Australian states, there were a few trial periods of permanent summertime (of 3 years) with a subsequent vote
Voters defeated permanent summertime after the trial periods
Similarly, Russia adopted permanent summertime for a few years
The idea was initially well-received, however, after experiencing permanent summertime for a couple of years, public support dropped to less than a third
The decision was subsequently reversed
In any case, I don't care that you don't care about the average citizen
However, I do think that politicians should base their decision by consulting with science and if they would were/are to ask people they should accurately inform them on the topic
during the religious wars in France, we gave refuge to a lot of the hugenots (French protestants who were being persecuted), which is actually how the watchmaking industry came to Switzerland
I wish I could say the same for mine
I'm not sure, to be honest
not all of them were, perhaps it's coincidental
There's so many to choose from, I'd say either Paris or London, but preferably London
I think I didn't see a single car in Naples that wasn't duct taped in one place or another
The car that got us from the Airport just had mirror pieces stuck to the side view mirror with double sided tape
Yeah, those tiny steep little alleys where you almost get run over because cars drive through them even though they almost touch the walls with their mirrors
>1980's West/East Berlin
Oh wow didn't even think of a setting in a different time period, would be super dope
Oh god haha this would actually be hilarious

Water
Guys, there are fountains everywhere, please stop paying for bottled water
We don't really have any tourist traps here, not any that I know of
Edit: Okay, there are much more than I thought, I really haven't been around here that much apparently :/ Sorry guys
Zermatt (not that it isn't great but it's expensive, and well yeah the Matterhorn buuuuuut)
Lauterbrunnen/Jungfraujoch, maybe even the town of lucerne
Lucerne has a problem that big coaches full of asian tourist groups drive into town and storm the watch stores
I mean it brings lots of money, but the busses are a pain in the ass
They go walking by the Quai, want to see the lion monument and take the cablecaar to mount pilatus
Some of them even take a steam boat trip around the lake
Even the infoboards around town are written in chinese
Once the city locked a small proportion of the town around the coach-hub, because some swiss company invited 10'000 Chinese partners to lucerne, so for a week, there were even more than the average amount of tourists, which is already a lot
The interesting thing is, that the asians are already alot, but there's also a lot of americans and british, which you don't even recognize
The Arabians and indians mostly travel with their families, but they also spend insane amounts on the "most swiss things", like the asians (mostly chinese)
And for Jungfraujoch, the tickets to get up there are really expensive, even for swiss people
I think normally they start at about 80$, which is the early bird special
Normal tickets sale for around 100-150$. And then there's a restaurant on top where you can eat fondue which i didn't look up, but i guess it costs a fortune
It's also mostly big asian groups that the locals can profit off
They also travel in the coaches and do some sort of "Switzerland in a week" tour
They are mostly fairly rich people
While I agree that Florence and Siena are nicer, I find really weird saying that Pisa presents no interest outside of the cathedral area
I found it a charming city, although being married to a Florentine I should add : "Pisa merda".
Some restaurant definitely use the excuse of 'Switzerland is so expensive' to inflate their prices even more
Same for gift shops and other tourist attractions
Hate to say it but Lucerne really had  a tourist-trap feel to it the last time I was there
Overcrowded and all the shops selling overpriced, stereotypical Swissness
Love the Verkehrsmuseum, though
if you have enough money then absolutely visit the Jungfrau Region but if you’re on a tighter Budget i recommend going to every else except Zermatt
Yeah I went to eat there on my first evening in Copenhagen and thought the prices were reasonable
Yeah i wanted to go there this summer, but i guess thats not going to happen
I love chocolate and have a deep hatred for people who are late
Yes, the S-Bahn being late 3 minutes pisses me off
Spy movies have many scenes in Switzerland and usually it’s pure nature (not a single valley is uninhabited), a lonely castle (castles are usually amidst or close to a village) or old chalet in the mountains, comically traditional locals (Swiss people are normal)
Throw in a secret vault with gold here and there
Oh damn I want to watch this so hard right now
Or [that scene] in The Wolf of Wall Street
I’m fairly certain there isn’t a single building in Geneva that has such a view
It looks more like they’re on top of the Cathedral’s spire, or just straight up flying on a plane above the city
Yeah it looks like they put in an aerial view of Geneva
There is no building that tall there
Met quite a few Swiss people (and different ones at that) that have shared a theory that there are little/no "terrorist attacks" in Switzerland because the people who usually finance these attacks all have their money in Swiss banks
The the Swiss built CERN to communicate with the devil/hell/trans-dimensional demons, and that the Gotthard Base Tunnel is a portal we are building to release them from hell into our world
Why, you ask
Well because we are trying to build a new nazi empire with the help of the IMF, UN, Rothschilds, NASCAR, The Russians, FIFA, etc
, and the easiest way for a small country to take over the world is to clearly use demons
To be fair, I visited Canton Uri a few weeks ago and they have quite the obsession with Satan building public infrastructure for them
Lucky for us, they were "clever" enough to tricking the devil into building them an impossible bridge
So there's that
It would be much cheaper and quicker just to send all the university sport teams to an island with free booze for a week
We sometimes joke about conquering Lichtenstein
Not because we would like to, but because our great military keeps wandering into Lichtenstein territory "by accident".
Not necessarily reconquering, but we joke (or maybe not) about Liechtenstein already being the 27th canton
Not really no, but it might be because we haven’t lost our conquered territories
(Yes that is one way of seeing it)
we joke about reconquering valtellina and annexing haute Savoie, which we claimed in the Congress of Vienna but didn't get
We often joke about annexing Liechtenstein
I mean we invaded them by accident a few times already but the jokes are usually like "let's send half the police force of that really small town and let's conquer Liechtenstein". They're basically a part of Switzerland anyways like they were our little bro
Look we kicked you out many centuries ago, you're not fucking with us on this one
Interestingly, the original seat of the House of Habsburg is Habsburg Castle, which is located in what is now a village named Habsburg in the canton of Aargau in Switzerland
They moved out in 1220 or maybe a bit later because it was too small
About 200 years later, they lost it to the Swiss Confederacy
I am already excited for the sequel in november
I heard it will take place in the us
Why they have the medical system they have and a lot of people actually seem to support it

Their obsession with the army, and how soldiers get treated like absolute heros who deserve the whole world
We also do that in Switzerland
I see at lest 15 flags from my balcony
But we dom‘t have that cult around it
That’s an extremely normal way to open a sales call in the US
It’s like a formula
He says that, then you say, “fine thanks, how are you
” Then he says, “great
” Then the call begins
Pretty common in really big countries that depend on patriotism to secure national unity
You will find more than one country in America (continent) where they sing the national hymn and do simmilar stuff every morning before class
The bread thing is so real
Never been to America but to enough other places to know how hard it is to find a goddamn normal loaf of bread that doesn't have the consistency of a marshmellow
Feel free to ask
I‘m not an expert on our weapon laws but I can tell you the basics
But from what I've heard, advertising on TV is a huge thing and they want to advertise a single price and they can do that if they don't include tax
At least that's an explanation I've heard
Back until a few years ago
Moving to a new home/apt
1 day
Had a child (fathers): 1 day
So the joke is the Swiss considering a father's role in the birth of a child to be as tedious as moving apartments
in Switzerland mandatory paid leave:
* 4 weeks paid holidays, 5 for employees younger than 21 years (many companies go a bit further than 4 weeks and give 5 or more weeks for people that are 50 + years of age)
* 14 weeks of maternity leave  - by law only after giving birth, but you might get medical leave (i.e. a doctor certifies you are unfit to work) before giving birth, depending on doctor
Companies get reimbursed 80% of the wages of the employee
* 2 weeks of paternity leave within 6 month of a childs birth, can be claimed as weeks or seperate days -> this law was enacted in december 2019 and became effective 1
2021
* up to three days at a time to care for familymembers that suffer a ' impairment to health', but in total no more than 10 days a year -> also enacted in dec 2019 and effective sinde 1
2021
* limited paid leave for absences due to personal reasons not in ones powers; i.e. leave due to sicknes, accident, other duties by law, mostly military or substitute service, recruitment, fulfilling public office duties, like jury duty (although i'm not sure if any canton still has jury trial) - in these cases the company gets reimbursed 80% of the wages by the Government or (in case of sickness or accident) insurances
there are further "usual days and hours" that have to be granted according to Art
329 Abs
3 OR, which is very imprecise, which leaves a lot of room for interpretation, but those days and hours are usually/often granted as follows :
* appointments with doctors or government agencies, if it's not possible to have them outside of work
* 1 day for relocation (some companies grant more, sometimes depending on if you move out of canton)
* Marriages:
* 2 days for your own marriage
* 1 day for your childs marriage
* cases of death in the family:
* Children or spouse: 3 days
* other family: up to 3 days
* other relatives: 1 day (i'm not entirely sure where the line is drawn between other family / relatives, i presume brothers, sisters and parents count as family, the rest as relatives)
Also, if you are let go and are still in your legal persiod of notice, you are elligible to get paid leave of up to half a day per week to look for a new job - of course, dependiung on your job it is also quite usual to release someone from their duties as soon as they get notice - which means you basically might get up to three months of paid leave
Didn't we vote to have more father's leave just recently
Another speciality of Switzerland is of course the military service
If I’m not mistaken you’ll get up to 25 days of fully paid leave a year to complete it
Yes, fathers now get [two weeks]
Physically impossible - and i just did nit have the right word on the top of my head  edited
[Val Bavona] a small valley in the far end of the Maggia Valley
It is overshadowed by the Verzasca Valley which is next to the Maggia Valley
Verzasca is famous for it‘s „Golden Eye“ Damm, but Val Bavona has beautiful steep cliffs, water as fresh and clear as id gets and also a magnificent waterfall
Indoeuropean seven/siedem/sieben vs
semitic سبعة/ሰባት/שבעה (pronounced mostly like "sabaa")
Despite the superficial similarity, I don't think any relation of indoeuropean and semitic numeral has been proven
Oh but we got plenty
Here's a [small list]
„bekommen“ (German) vs
„to become“
„bekommen“ means „to get“/ „to be given“,
„to become“ would be „werden“ in German
This is a thing sooo many English students from German speaking countries struggle with
It’s even worse since Kommen means To Come
When I was learning German in school, this was a real struggle
Palestine wants their Hammas back
French speaking part of Switzerland here
While I do hear about France a lot, I feel like it’s mostly news about cultural aspects that we share, or news about major events that I am interested in anyway, so I’ve never really felt overwhelmed by it
We’re closer to France than any other country, in some regards even closer than other parts of Switzerland, so I think it’s only natural to be informed of what’s happening over there
Other countries such as Germany or Italy I hardly see any news about, unless it’s really big or I’m actively looking for it
In German news in Switzerland there is quite a lot of Germany and sometimes Austria related stuff but it's not overwhelming
Many people also watch German and maybe also Austrian TV though so they Ivorian /obviously get these news
I don't know how other regions of Switzerland experience it
However, I can say that the amount of news from other linguistical regions of the country is rather underwhelming
In French speaking Switzerland
I follow no French news, but that's probably because I mostly hang out on "English Internet". I don't even really see much of Swiss news to be honest
Definitely the Netherlands
Definitely not Germany
Norway maybe, dont know if I'd move at all
Me too
If you settle in one region, you really don’t need to speak the other languages
I live in the french speaking region, my German is pretty poor and I can’t speak Italian at all
Same for most people I know
Same, it’s definitely the nicest part of the country
I will <3
I'd happily change that rain for a bit of snow, we haven't had any so far
holidays in sicily at the beach: a group of german girls gossip and laugh about my very pale skin

I've never seen a Spanish deck of cards before
Until now I didn't even know it existed
We use French and German cards for most things
We also have lots of regional variations on both of these styles used for a Swiss card game called Jass
I’ve never heard of the spanish deck before
But where I live we use the french deck and the german deck more or less interchangably
There might be a few games that don’t work with one or the other but in general both are aproximately similarly known i would say
But correct me if I’m wrong
I will start to wear a jacket at 10 degrees
At 15 if i have to be outside for prolonged time

above that I only wear a thick shirt or a pullover
EU, blue, "home" (it's not the word "home" itself, but rather a feeling of being home)
Because I said "EU" or because I said "blue"?
Geneva is literally the most boring major city in the whole of Switzerland
Where have all you people been visiting in Switzerland to say it's boring
I'm really curious because I feel there always something going on in my region
How is Freiburg more interesting than Switzerland (I'm there like twice a year and think it's nice but kinda small and boring)
Boring
Where in Switzerland have you been
In my area, there's always stuff going on
Most likey Lauterbrunnen and Bahnhofstrasse
If you only visit the tourist attractions you might think Switzerland is boring, which it isnt
Definitly not more boring than the Netherlands
Like in any other country
The banking sector makes up less than 10% of the swiss economy  fyi
Switzerland has a lot of culture to offer
Theaters, events, shows you name it
For example the biggest hip-hop festival of Europe is in Frauenfeld, Switzerland, Zurich has the highest density of night clubs etc
I believed in everyone I ever voted for
Didn’t always win, but that’s just how it is
I don't vote for electing party members or things like that but I vote on laws so I don't really have that problem
Did you sometimes not vote for your party, because the candidat doesn't have any chance and your vote would go to someone/a party you didn't like
If not, could you imagine not voting for them, because of that
A question about UK politics: Do the MP's usually represent their party or their voting district
In Switzerland, the smaller chamber is made of 1-2 representatives from every canton/voting district
They *should* represent their canton in some way or form, but when voting and in pairlament it doesn't matter so much from where you are, but rahter which party you belong to/what your own opinions are on subjects
There is no such thing as "my" party
I usually look to vote for the party or person that is closest to how I see things
Of course you’ll never agree 100%, but I always vote out of conviction, not out of political calculation
For example there are many people in France who voted Macron instead of Hamon in 2017, because they didn’t want to see a second round of Fillon (right) vs Le Pen (far right)
That’s something I wouldn’t do
I do know I’m a pretty idealist person
How far do your idealistic views go
Example: I'm from a smaller canton (Solothurn) which has only 6 seats in the National Council, so only the biggest few parties can get a seat
My parents really like the EVP/PEV and even know some of them personally, but would not vote for them, because they are on a list with CVP/PDC which they don't really like
My parents would rather vote for SP/PS because it would align more with their views
Regardless of actual politics, would you still vote for the EVP/PEV or would you switch to SP/PS
>However it is important to remember that voting isn't all MPs do, they will still fight for their own constituency's interests in other ways
Yeah, in the smaller chamber in Switzerland this doesn't matter that much
Lol my mother is the same, living in Solothurn and knows people of the EVP
She does still vote for them though, she doesn't seem that bothered by the CVP, as long as it's not the SVP
I would absolutely vote for SP even if he may not get a seat at all
This is exactly what I mean by "sometimes you lose, but that’s just how it is". Imagine everyone just assumed the SP candidate would lose anyway and didn’t vote for him, although if all those who actually liked him had voted for him, he might have had a chance
The internet is a small place
it's very common, and in my personal opinion it should be seen less in public spaces, especially train stations
It's becoming less common
What I've noticed is that teenagers in the "easier" high schools (Sek B and E) tend to smoke way more often than people from the harder one (Gymnasium), I guess there's less peer pressure there (at least at the school I went to)
I am very happy with the no smoking rules put into place in some of the train stations, and the fine for tossing cigarette butts on the ground (80CHF)
I wish that both were better enforced
The amount of smoking in this country is unfortunate
And yes, this is despite it being lower than [most European countries]
>According to official statistics, smoking prevalence in Switzerland is among the lowest in Europe (about 25%, 28% is the average in Europe)
Did anyone else notice that people who go or went to a Sek B or E smoke way more often than people from the Gymnasium
Is there less peer pressure or are people from the gymnasium not cool enough
A ban on smoking at the outdoor section of cafes and restaurants would be wonderful
Actually in my extendend friend group hardly anyone smokes maybe 1 or 2 people
Of course I see plenty of people smoking at the train stations or im Ausgang but idk if it is that prevalent
In Switzerland it was banned for a short time in the beginning
But importing it for personal use was completely legal, just no legal way to sell it
Soon it became completely legal and now you can get it everywhere you can get cigarettes
Many are still directly imported from Sweden and just slap a sticker on it for translations
I was in the gymi and I've seen a lot of people smoke, I'd say that probably, people are more respectful about peer pressure there than what I've heard from my sek friends
but that's a personal experience
Then it probably was a personal experience with my school too, it's also possible that they were more strict about smoking, the school was foe grades 6-13 and you were only allowed to smoke om school grounds starting grade 10
And completely legal here in Switzerland
It's actually a pretty strange situation: there is tobacco free snus which is basically just cellulose with nicotine in the bag
And right now this does not fall under the tobacco tax, so the companies make a lot of money since nobody realizes and the prices are comparable to smoking, which is indeed heavily taxed
I know many people that use snus
Most aren't really addicted and could stop whenever
Some are though
They offered me a job and a residence permit
So here I am in annoyingly beautiful Switzerland
Welcome to Switzerland
What region did you end up in
Any troubles with the language(s)
Romandie/Geneve
French is conversational
But I have an advantage considering I speak Spanish fluently
Nah
I've been here 6 years
Calling Emmentaler "Swiss cheese"
We invemted like a dozen different cheese sorst; Gruyère, Emmentaler, Sprinz, Appenzeller etc
That's like calling Champagne "the french wine" or Kölsch "the german beer".
It has a name
Do your research
Edit: changed Pils to Kölsch
it’s grüezi, not grüzi gopferdamminomol
that works for us too
You're right, you are Bavarians
Weird, it's on wikipedia's german beer sorts article
Switzerland is the only country that has a "bunkers for all" policy, meaning that it has enough underground bunkers to fit the entire population in it, in case of a national emergency like a war or a nuclear strike
In WW2, Switzerland managed to get possession of the newest German Messerschmitt plane that has crashed into our territory
It had all the latest top secret equipment
The allies offered to buy it from us, the Germans offered us multiple regular Messerschmitts in exchange
Being neutral, we decided to let a high ranking German officer come witness us burn it to the ground
That honestly doesnt surprise me at all
Wat
I didn't know we had something so awesome
Oh wait, I know which thread I can post this to
No, they're nuclear bomb shelters, not air raid shelters
According to my corporal, the design was actually tested in the Nevada desert during a US nuclear test - don't know if that's true or not though
No they meant won instead of one
And I just lerned that fact yesterday
It depends on what you want to achieve
If you want to force a regime change, sanctions probably won't help much with that
If you want to hinder a country's capabilities, e.g. in acting aggressively towards others, then hurting their economy will simply reduce the amount of available resources they can spend on foreign policy adventures, or on expensive military programs - regardless of the consequences for the population
Are you my scientific writing prof
You dont understamd all of it do you
I mean i can hear the similarity in some words and maybe even translate or understand a sentence but do you really get all of it
That would be called a casemate, I believe
Help settle a debate
What % of women, sunbathe topless in Europe
Currently in an [argument] with a British redditor who claims up to 50% of women in certain European countries are topless when sunbathing (beach, pool, lake, etc) in public
I don't think it's that high, and put my number at less than 10%.
What's your opinion/experience
That 50% seems very high to me from my own random observations
I think it is less than 20% here these days, and probably closer to your 10% estimate
In the 80's and 90's this was more commonplace, in my experience, and has kind of diminished since then
I have no real numbers or statistics, just the feeling that it is rare
Pretty sure he went to an FKK beach in Germany lol
I agreed with OP in that it's definitely the highest in Spain compared to other places
And would even be confident to say it's probably closer to 20%.
Meaning if I counted 100 women at a beach, I'd probably see (around) 20 people topless
But 50 out of 100 seems crazy, even for Spain
OP's figures
>1 of 2 is realistic for Spain, 1 of 3 is realistic for France, UK I would say 1 of 7, UK is very prudish compared to mainland Europe
Do it regularly or have done it once
Article claims both and there's a huge difference between the two
Agree
And let me explain that I'm not getting into this debate with him/her because I absolutely want to prove their numbers wrong
But because I myself am an American, and the last thing I'd want is for another American to read his figures and come to Europe with the idea (either for pervy reasons or other) that he/she should expect to see half of the women topless
It just reads like a bad r/AskEurope question down the line
Because the beach is for beach goers in that one specific time frame
The Internet is forever and for everyone
Here the median salary is around 6000€ (not the average, I couldn’t find a good source) a month
The cheapest sets of lego they have on the swiss online shop are around 11€, while the most expensive one I found was the Millenium Falcon at 929€ (!)
I guess overall lego is pretty affordable for everyone, although I highly doubt non-fans would spend almost 1000€ on a single set
> I’ve never googled names of anyone I personally know, and expect the same of others
That sounds very naive for your age
But yeah
your host family was rude in that moment
Up to old English I understand pretty much everything
But the "old" and "oldest" English phrases are a mystery for me, I can't understand anything at all
Native German speaker here
Early modern English isn't that bad
Reminds me of Romeo and Juliet, which we read in school
Wasn't to hard to understand but need to read it a bit slower than the normal English we're all used to, probably because of the sentence structure that throws me off a bit
Middle English has a really strange effect on pronunciation
It just makes sense to me
Some words, if I wouldn't understand any English at all, would be pronounced like they are in Modern English just by reading Middle English out loud
Sentence structure is just as strange and old timely as Early Modern English though
Old English looks strange
If it were written in a more normal way then maybe but like this not really
I mean I don't speak Spanish or Dutch, never learned it, but can understand it much better (thanks to French, Latin and some Italian / German&English) than the Old English text
Edit: Scots is strange
Get the gist of it but who the fuck speaks like this
So still widely in use it seems
Nice to know
Switzerlands 1
of August - the story behind it is
Well Swiss people just wanted a national holiday and could not be arsed to actually check the date of the Rütlischwur
I mean, the 1
of August celebrates the Bundesbrief, not the Rütlischwur, even though we kinda mashed the two together somehow in folklore (even though the latter happened on 8
November, according to the tales written over a century after it supposedly took place)
And officially, the 1
of August has only been a national holiday since 1994
Probably this by Federal Council memebr Ueli Maurer
This interview with one of our federal council members Ueli Maurer:
Also our current president Guy Parmelin who can -in his own words- 'english understand'.
[here around the 4:20 min mark]
Switzerland's black spot wasn't so much an "active" atrocity as it was an act of incredible and shameful cowardice
Before and during WWII, many German, Austrian and French Jews tried to seek refuge in neutral Switzerland
In places like Kreuzlingen and Basel they attempted to cross the green border
Some waited until nightfall and swam across the Rhine
This was an extremely dangerous undertaking, especially if they were families or mothers with little children
They knew that if they'd be caught by German border patrol officers, they would be shot on the spot
There are reports of Jewish refugees who got lost in the forest and almost had a heart attack when two men in uniforms suddenly yelled "Hey, you
" - only to find out later with great relief that those officers were Swiss
In most cases, however, the relief did not last long
Instead of offering these people political asylum, Switzerland extradited them right into the hands of the Gestapo
The vast majority of Jewish refugees in Switzerland eventually died a miserable death in a Nazi concentration camp
What's particularly pathetic about this issue is that the Swiss government tried to cover up its responsibility for many decades, claiming it hadn't known about the Nazi death camps at the time
It was only in the early 2000s when a detailed historical research revealed that the Swiss federal council had already been informed about these concentration camps all the way back in 1937
There would've been more than enough time to act if they had wanted to act
Unfortunately, despite the fact that we remained a proper democracy throughout WWII, a significant number of conservative MPs and federal council sympathized with the "Frontist movement", a movement that was very Germanophile and shared a lot of Nazi ideology
The Federal Council at the time was scared shitless of a nazi invasion
They did everything they could to not provoke Hitler, including sending back Jewish people
In the end it worked I guess, but still, it's shameful
If you want to format urls, you can use \[TEXT](URL)  on mobile
I don't understand it either
It was probably out of shame
[Verdingkinder] And that's assuming you give us a pass for the nazi gold
Some might say, taking the gold of Jews during WW2 to secure it and then demanding death certificates for people having died in concentration camps from the descendants to get their money back
But I say, that was technically correct and as we all know, that is the best kind of correct
No, my choice is planning to acquire [the atomic bomb and testing it in the Alps]
Well the Nazi Gold thing is definitly up there, but at least that has been [paid back]
Then there was also the time when the state took [children] away from families because they were poor or because the mother wasn’t married, and sold the kids to rich people where the kids were severely mistreated and used as laborers
That happened up until the 1960ies
Then there’s also the [time] where we kept allied and soviet soldiers that landed in Switzerland in a prison with horrible conditions
Ah I see you got it covered
Merci
I guess
TIL
And I thought the nazi gold was the only recent bad thing
Arbeitswiedereinstiegssonntagabendsdepression
There, I just created it for you
Edit: Arbeitswiedereinstiegssonntagabendsdepressionsbesäufnis would be what you do when you get drunk because you feel so shitty that it's the end of the weekend ;-)
The term for that woud be r/suspiciouslyspecific ;-)
we burn a huge snowman made of hay and wood each spring
the quicker it takes to burn down, the better will the summer be
Höhenfeuer (High up fires)
For our national celebration on 1
August we light up pretty big fires on top of hills
This was used hundreds of years ago as a way of communicating and warning from enemy invasions and so on
Add some firework and lots of flags, if the weather's nice some backyard bbq + drinks and that's basically how we celebrate it
A Swiss who doesn’t have a bank account
Alternatively, a Swiss who doesn’t like cheese or chocolate
A Swiss person who can't ski, a Swiss person who doesn't eat cheese and a Swiss person who doesn't eat chocolate
Regional: Someone from Jura who doesn't have a watch, someone from Graubünden who is a vegetarian, someone from Bern who isn't slow af, anything else
Latin has sol (m) and luna (f) and therefore all romance languages have it like that
Terra (earth) is also female
Latin doesn't have articles though
In Arabic it's like in German: الشمس (aš-šamu, the sun) is female and القمد (al-qamaru, the moon) is male
الأرض (al-'ardun, the earth) is female
I’ve seen people give gender to some countries in english, like calling Britain 'her'. Is that an uncommon thing ?
Alter, „der Nutella“ ist doch beyond fucked
I don't use it myself (we in turn use "der Butter"), but it's probably due to implication with "der Aufstrich". Like it's "die Nintendo Switch" because of "Konsole", even though the older networking hardware is called "der Switch".
actually, I don't think we really had a golden age
in medieval times, Switzerland was very prestigious for its mercenaries, post napoleonic, we're more known for the quality of our products and our banking
I'd say we're more of a slow burn of constant, relative prestige, rather than having one golden age
Nah i don‘t think so
It‘s never been as good as now, in my opinion
Some may say the times before the vienna congress when we had some more territory down in italy, that we don‘t have anymore
I think if we there is a golden age for us, it is now
The rest is just one big silver age
Went to Paris for the Japan Expo 10 years ago with my parents and a friend of mine
The last Saturday she had **huge** pain in her belly, was lightheaded and a few other symptoms
We tried to go to the hospital but the E.R. was closed
Tried like 4 clinics with E.R.s but all closed too
The only one that was open had the on duty doctor only arriving in the middle of the afternoon when it was 10am
Receptionist tried to call her until she got a hold of her because my friend was visibly in pain
The doctor made my friend explain was was going on on the phone and sent us to another clinic to get some scans and tests
Turns out one of her kidneys had shutdown and she needed immediate medical attention
Yeah, never ever take a taxi in Switzerland
It's a rip-off
Use public transportation as it will take you almost anywhere
Still expensive, but not as much as a taxi
That's the question of the decade mate
We were puzzled to say the least
To be fair the E.R. from the Paris hospital was technically opened since we could enter but there was noone except for two cops and one cuffed guy
There was a sign on the receptionist desk saying it was closed
Yeah it was a great week until that point
Just like how the fuck does that happen in bloody capital
It's one thing to joke that France is a third-world country, it's another to experience it
Yeah
We were fucking panicked
I can't understand how the bloody capital doesn't have a decent E.R. and on duty doctor system
She would have gotten taken care almost immediately it happened here
Well we did ask the taxi to take us to the E.R. from the nearest hospital and the sign said both "hôpital" and "urgences"
The E.R. was empty except for two cops, a cuffed guy and a sign saying "urgences fermées" on a desk
We then proceeded to call another cab who was friendly enough to take us to 4 places and even waited for us in-between if it was closed
Sorry that happened to you
Really poor behaviour from the police
I usually feel pretty save in Switzerland but there's obviously shitty people everywhere
A hijacked Ethiopian Airlines plane was headed to Geneva (pilot wanted asylum in Switzerland), but had to be intercepted by French/Italian fighter jets because the Swiss Air force doesn't work on nights and weekends
In Geneva, robbers robbed a bank while they were at circa 50m from a police station
The police came to the scene and they did not land a single shot
(not one the robbers and neither on their can)
Thought of another:
French woman called in anonymously to Geneva Airport claiming a woman was carrying a bomb and planned an attack
Military was called in, airport was shut down, flights were cancelled
Turns out the woman was suspecting her husband had a mistress (alleged bomber) and wanted her to be arrested
She spent 3 months in prison and was ordered to pay a 100K fine
Iirc it was also during a time where we were discussing buying new airplanes
Which made it even more hilarious
Haha didn't know that pne but sure sounds like us
Explanation
Here in Basel we had a casino robbery a few years back, where the thieves ran to France since the border was so close to the casino itself
>Iirc it was also during a time where we were discussing buying new airplanes
Which made it even more hilarious
New jets, right
The Gripen discussion
And yet here we are again
Then that's on the store
I shop a lot in France and I've never seen something as expensive as a PS4
A) Not have a security tag
B) Be able to be taken off the shelf without a worker opening it with a key
The Jura mountains for sure
I love lac de Joux and the canton of Neuchâtel particularly
A good friend of mine lives in Basque and when I visited, they introduced me to the joy of pintxos and showed me around the area
I'm still not over how pretty the Flysch are
German is not really widely spoken outside of Europe though
No idea, porbably ourselves because of not letting the jews money into switzerland but not the jews themselves
Dutroux is a meme even in other countries
As far as "regular" people go, he is super hated
We really don't have any super well known and loved or hated public figures
Somehow it would be so *not* Swiss to have that
I think it‘s more because more people were racist and antisemitic back then
But it could be both ;)
I keep hearing the name here in Switzerland quite often when it comes to sarcastic comparisons or remarks regarding the justice system
Him, and Fritzl, though Dutroux is considered much worse
Well exactly speaking like a swiss german is i would say impossible ive seen Germans that did it pretty solid but you can tell the difference really quick
In French I think it the grammar is easily achievable, the problem lies more in the accent
I’d say it’s still possible to pass for a native as a foreign speaker, but the only people I’ve heard do so have learned French fluently as a child
Otherwise, all foreign speakers I heard had an accent
French - It is very hard for both, insanely hard
Hell even native people make a lot of mistake
Swiss german is pretty much impossible to learn perfectly as a non native speaker, I think
Some germans try it but it usually sounds off
I‘ve heard one accepted refugee speak perfect swiss german, though
I think he was some kind of language genius or something because he was only learning it for maybe two years
I’m french-speaking, living in Germany and speak german so well noone has ever suspected I am not a native speaker
I would say it is only possible if you learn it as a kid
I tried to learn hungarian for a few months with duolingo
It‘s incredibly hard and I think I forgot most of it again
My grandparents on my fathers side fled from hungary in the fifties but my dad sadly never taught me hungarian
My grandma told me that I was able to communicate a bit as a toddler after a long-ish vacation in hungary, tho
And I guess it‘s good that I‘m at least kind of used to hearing it
But yeah
I can‘t even pronounce egy correctly so it must sound horrible to native speakers haha
PS: loooooove the food
My grandma and my dad sometimes make goulash and I could eat tons of it
Also my dad sometimes brings some kind of  salami with paprika in it
Not sure if that‘s very common but i love it
That phrase is mostly used to mock natives who made mistakes
At least here it is
Yes, yes, yes
How is that even a question
Unfortunately, I know this is never going to happen
Swiss people are the kind of voters who reject a [popular initiative to get 6 weeks of paid vacation] Yup, people in this country have been offered more holidays and their answer was "no thanks, I'd rather waste more time in the office instead of having fun with my family and friends
" Swiss people are also the kind of voters who reject proposals to introduce a minimum wage, to introduce socialized healthcare like in the rest of Western Europe or to introduce a UBI
hell is going to freeze over before Swiss voters say yes to a 4-day work-week
Thanks to the Germans who put up with the endless flood of Swiss shopping tourists that clog your shopping centers, supermarkets and especially drugstores in all cities close to the border, stubbornly speak Schwitzerdütsch and demand you understand them, and make you give MwSt
back to them (if you import goods from the EU to Switzerland you can get the taxes you paid instore back, bc taxation in the EU is different than it is over here
You are allowed to import goods worth up to 300CHF to Switzerland tax-free so Germany is basically one big dutyfree store to us)
Dutch is so weird it sounds like I should understand it perfectly but no chance in actually knowing what they said
Reading is ok if it's really basic stuff
Swiss-French and other French aren‘t all to different
Swiss-Italian and italian isn’t all to different either
All the Swissgerman dialects on the other hand are a lot more different to the German and Austrian-German  dialects
About Dutch well if you try hard enough at least for me you can understand the context what they are saying
Oh the second one we sang in religion class, too
I really liked it it had a nice melody
Both the music and the language
Everytime I turn on TVI it's always football lol
Does it exist
Yes otherwise people wouldnt indentify with it
Do I indentify as european
No not at all
Yes, very much so
Not necessarily in the sense that we all are the same (or should be), but in that we're much more the same than we are different
I feel and identify much more as "European" than "Swiss".
The fact that we don't share a common language I don't see as a hinderance - quite the opposite in some way
Being at least somewhat familiar with several languages is something most Europeans share
Or take city planning for example
I can navigate European cities
There's usually a well defined city center, and often an old town area nearby
Central train station too, probably
Distances are walkable, and there's a ton of "mixed use" zoning with little shops, restaurants and cafes mixed into residential areas
North America
Not so much
Residential and commerical zones are often heavily separated, downtown might be mainly a business district
Train stations feel more like an afterthought than the hub they often are in European cities
Suburbia, strip malls with huge parking lots - that's just not things we're familiar with here, at least not to that degree
I feel like something fundamental like this contributes much more to a shared European experience than things like a common language - or a common currency for that matter
> Do you even feel "European" at all
Or you feel more "connected" to your own country of origin
no there is nothing which connects me culturally with someone from Spain, Estonia or Bulgaria
I can't think of a single thing we share not even the alphabet in Bulgaria's case
The only transnational bond I feel is to the rest of the German speaking world and even that declines quite rapidly the further away it is
But there at least the cities often look the same, the people talk the same language and we all know Göthe, Schiller and the Nibelungenlied or also more contemporary things like DSDS lol
> Do you believe that we can create a new Nation,a new "Superpower" just by agreements,good words and peace
If a European state is formed then for geopolitical reasons and not because the people felt the radical need to be part of the same country
I wouldn't like that to happen though if we look at other multicultural states which formed in the end one culture became dominant and started to replace the local ones like Prussia in Germany for example and now people in Munich only speak Standard German and no longer Bavarian
The German values for example are originally Prussian values
I never looked into it but I'd bet it's the very similar in Italy
> Do you really believe we can build a federation only through good words and good intentions,not even having a common language to begin with
yes Switzerland is the best example of that or how a federal Europe could work in general but Switzerland was also formed by foreign powers, a common identity only really emerged due to outer threats in WW2 and it nearly fell into civil war in WW1
>I think being something like Switzerland is exactly what a federal Europe would be like
Direct democratic rights on a European level
Having multiple "heads of government" instead of one (and constitutionally ensuring that the population is represented in those)
Edit: just curious what aspects you have in mind
Disclaimer: I hate it when people label a city/country as a whole as "overrated" or <another negative label>. They're toursity for a reason, and life outside of tourism also does happen in those places
With that said, I'm gonna shift the discussion to mean a landmark/site, because some of those truly are ????
The Little Mermaid in Copenhagen
Every single person around me was like "Oh
That's it
" Same goes for the Flower Clock in Geneva, and (to an extent) Stonehenge
while not really overrated, cause they really are pretty, Lauterbrunnen and Luzern are very touristic
Lauterbrunnen is the place that looks like yosemite Valley with waterfalls, that you'll see everywhere with captions about how pretty Switzerland is
Luzern is a city in Central Switzerland that captures the kind of Swiss aesthetic pretty well
it has a modern city life, yet an old city core, it is situated at a pretty lake and its position puts it on the border between the picturesque alps and the populated plateau
You'll see tonnes of tourists there and there's this running joke that there are more Japanese people in Luzern than there are Swiss people, because it is very popular with East Asian visitors
Saw Stonehenge driving past it on the motorway
Didn't look impressive
Also: Manneken Pis in Brussels,you have the massive and beautiful square with the town hall (so impressive
) but all the tourust flock into the side street to that stupud 40cm tall fountain that's squeezed in some house corner
Interlaken
Nice place, don't get me wrong, but you can get as cute towns nearby with less than a quarter of the tourists Interlaken has
Guess it's so crowded because Lauterbrunnen and Grindelwald are nearby
For the sculpture category also: Manneken Pis in Brussrls
It's like 40cm tall
>the Flower Clock in Geneva
Geneva is my home town and I love it, but that flower clock is the most underwhelming touristic attraction I've ever seen
And yet I bring people there each time they come visit because it's in their guides and they want to see what it is about
The good thing is that it's in a nice area so at least you can resume your stroll to a nice place quite fast
What gets me with London is just how big it really is
I've been there twice, each time for a few (intense) days, and I still feel like I haven't seen even half of it
I was only in Amsterdam for now and it definitely felt more like an "amusement park" rather than an actual city where people live
Lucca for example, half an hour away
I have ptsd everytime I hear a bike ring
Well that's not that bad then
Here in Switzerland you easily pay about 6-7€ per 0
5l just in any regular bar
So pretty much the same then for me, of course there's a big difference due to purchase power but yeah
Damn that's quite a difference though
Yeah now I got it, thanks
I only knew the fake wiesn in zurich was really overpriced (15€, seat costs additionally) so the real one looked nice enough to me
I heard you need a reservation but never checked
It's quite small and nobody I know has ever been so there's that
Ok, thanks for all the insight
I was thinking of going maybe this or next year as I've never been but in that case I think I'll check out a smaller one first :)
we‘re pretty neutral but i‘d say germany or austria
We like to keep to ourselves, so basically anyone that fucks with us
Maybe austria, because they are just a copy uf us or we of them
Depends on the region, but whoever is on the other side of the border from where we live in Switzerland
Edit : except Lichtenstein
Austria and Germany for sure
also Singapore; they're taking away all our shady bank business
I would say Germany
I just lost it at pussy phone, thanks for that
Jungfraujoch or how they like to call it "The Top of Europe". We have a million mountains to visit, why visit the one that costs you an insane amount of money
If you do it because you like the train experience there are other options as well
Gornergrat or the Bernina for example
Its by far the most famous tourist trap in Switzerland imo and as long as it is this expensive, not worth it
Also with the verb 'violer', Viola in english means Alto, but in french it means rape
The word "respectively" is quite similar to the last one you've mentioned
In German, "respektive" means something like "put differently" or "in other words". In English, "respectively" means something like "A belonging to A and B belonging to B" ("She and I were 25 and 27 years old, respectively
Overall it's pretty nice living here, but I don't like the mentality of most people here
If I were to move I'd probably choose the Netherlands
as much as I like complaining about it, I probably could not see myself living anywhere else long term
I've lived in Japan for a year and in the USA for a year, which was fun, but I couldn't do it forever
Yes I love living here
It's the best country in the world (both statistically and patriotically speaking)
I'd never ever move somewhere else
I've lived at various places for shorter times and everytime I missed Switzerland
wtf bdsm is not forbidden in Switzerland
This [meme] I made for this comment sums it up
Great natural armour, although I wouldn't mind being in Scandinavia as well, cause winters are too warm here for me
It really feels like we’re at the heart of Europe, so that’s nice
It’s easy to travel, from Lausanne where I live both Paris and Milano are only 4 hours away by train
It’s also what gave Switzerland it’s amazing cultural diversity, which I really enjoy
The landscape is obviously beautiful, with the mountains and the lakes
Only complaint maybe is that I sometimes wish we had access to the sea
CZECHIA
I love the historical borders of my first homeland Czechia literally in the heart of Europe
**Czechia**, also known as the Czech Republic, is a very picturesque country in Central Europe
It borders Poland, Slovakia, Austria and Germany
Every year millions of tourists from all over the world visit my country
Many people regard Prague as one of the most beautiful cities in Europe and worldwide
But Czechia is much more than only Prague
There are 12 UNESCO World Heritage sites, many medieval towns and picturesque landscapes
This website presents the most amazing places to visit in Czechia, the very heart of Europe
&#x200B;
[www
czechia-heart-of-europe
com]
don’t forget you also have a huge as piece of jungle in south america
Love to Slovakia from brotherly Czechia
Amazing Lithuania, love from Czechia
But Switzerland has the front row of seats
You can then make Greater Switzerland by conquering all of the world
they aren’t part of proper france
they’re almost independent
i was wondering the same thing
Don't worry my dude
Black people are just like everyone else
So if everyone here is capable of understanding a joke with one exception it's going to be the same way for black people
I am German and grew up in Switzerland
You might not be able to take jokes about Germans but I love a good joke no matter if it's about my nationality or anything else
Pretty rare, so far i have seen two in my life
Both were a 4x4 variant
The Korean/American/South American side of me
French colleagues invited us over to a park for a bbq
When we showed up the host lead us to an empty grill informing us we could cook our food here
"wait
my food
"wait
you didn't bring food
"wait
you have to bring your OWN food
"yeah
it's a bbq
"exactly
"exactly
Reading these comments made me realize why my Portuguese parents eat dinner at 10
Growing up with Swiss culture and standards I always found it weird how my classmates ate dinner at around 6 and my family about 4 hours later
>He is obligated to let me cross the road by law
Every big european city: I'm gonna pretend I didn't see that
Was in Madrid for work last week
Spanish coworkers left for lunch at 2 PM
Had a meeting at 4 PM
They got back at 5 PM
"It's ok we usually work past 7 PM here
Just no
Yeah our dinner ended past 11 PM
F. me
Stage 2
In a lot of cultures outside of Europe if you invite someone over to your house during dinner hours (let's say 5PM - 8PM), the expectation is you will feed the guests dinner
Not the case in France/Switzerland/Scandinavia/etc
I've had many instances where I show up and am fed some charcuterie, wine, bread, nuts and the night kind of ends
That's a cardinal sin in Asian cultures
I've never been to an event like that where it wasn't specifically stated by the host that you bring your own food
My mom is Swiss, dad is Peruvian
Very often we eat dinner twice, a cold one at 5 and a huge Burger at 9 or so because we are already hungry again
Mom just accepts it now and even asks for the Burger too
Forgot to mention, I was grumpy because I was up since 5AM to catch a flight to make a 9 AM meeting, that THEY scheduled, which ended up starting at NOON (which is around the time normal people usually eat)
I'm not even Asian but still expect dinner when I'm invited to someone's place at those hours
Do people in Switzerland really invite their friends and then it's just that nobody is having dinner that day or something
Are there regional differences regarding this phenomenon
Yeah I wondered that too, always had trouble with it as I normally go to sleep at 11
Often I just skip diner
Guess it has something to do with business closing hours – when we're in Portugal visiting family, I often notice that many shops are still open on late evenings
Here you would have to be very very lucky to find any shops open after 6 pm
Or maybe it's just a simple cultural difference
Reading the comment from the Finnish flair above confirms my complaint
There's no need to specify that it is "FOR DINNER". If it's an invitation during dinner hours, my assumption is food will be served
>  They stayed untill midnight, and we had no proper food to serve
It was awkward to say the least
What I would do in this scenario
* Cook up whatever is in the fridge/freezer
* If the above is not possible, you order take out
* If the above is not possible, you sort of hint to the guest that it's time they start hitting the road
Thing is, in the cultures I'm from the 3rd option is not possible
You will go outside and cut some greens or hunt an animal before you let a guest leave hungry
Problem was
Our meeting was between lowlings, the lunch was with the super boss, and he was the reason it was 3 hrs
I guess hierarchy is big in Spain
I read that too
Also the whole struwwelpeter
I'm not that old and everybody my age knew and most read it as well/got it as a picture book
Der Wolf und die Geisslein
We have it too
Isn‘t it one of Grimm‘s Fairytales
Right, I didn‘t remember it very clearly
Also the decapitation detail is gruelling
Thanks for clearing it up:)
the Swiss
because we've got 7 heads of states
One of our guys in the  Federal Council already looks like Agent 47 [ , my money is on him
They would probably do everything to avoid joining the fight tho
Last time I checked there were seven
brother Maynard, bring up the holy hand grenade
would you look at that I really just misspelled 7 and didn't notice
I‘ve experienced something similar between Germany and Switzerland
In Switzerland, Mittag (noon) means like 12:00 - 14:00, while I‘ve heard some Germans use the term Mittag for the whole afternoon
Actually yes, we do have some
Billboards are pretty rare but we have a smaller versionnof those everywhere
Usually directly up against a wall of a house, sometimes free standing along roads and everywhere on public transport stations
They're about 1m off the ground and usually 1m x 2m in size
As it's easy to rent you get changing ads on those all the time and from timt to time even religious ones
The most common (maybe only
) Ones I know are a plain blue background with yellow font in the middle
The text is usually something positive in the way of "love your neighbor as you love yourself" or "god will protect you". (Not literally those but in this kind of way
Usually good sentences, not you'll rot in hell or something)
I unfortunately saw a few in Switzerland around where I live recently, but just some generic stuff like "god loves you" or whatnot
Dutch
I understand a lot when I read it but the pronunciation - totally different story
So I can't speak it and don't understand it spoken
Dutch, Its like we are long lost brother or something
This only applies to swiss though, germans dont have a clue when reading dutch
We love our little secret language
JÄ HUERÄ SIECH I VERSTICKÄ UND NIEMER CHUNNT CHO HÄLFÄ!
Man, every time I show any of my german friends written swiss german, they understand everything except siech, it's hilarious
We call it Bünzlitum
It's impossible to describe, but this should give you a good overview:
Chnabäschüüsse
A kind of festival where the best shooter gets a reward
Schwingä
A one on one fight with special belts in an arena of sand
Cities staying in a rather rural style than in a modern urban one
Here we for example have not a single sjyscraper
Reason given us that most people don't want our cities to become typicel skyline-cities
This is mostly Swiss-german tho, we french speakers are a bit more easy going I think
I think so, yes
Not for us
I did, for talking too loud at a public fireplace near the woods
Several times
I guess Döner/Kebab in the cities, not so much in the countryside
Generally speaking, Swiss people don't eat much fast food
It's considered something you do as a teenager and you're supposed to grow out of it sometime in your mid 20s.
Gipfeli mit Schoggistängeli
Kebab isn’t swiss tho
Also I’ve never heard anyone say you’re expected to stop eating fast food in your 20s, what the hell
I don’t know where you live but here in Lausanne fast foods have been flourishing, there’s more than ever

I have seen it a few times, but it's very rare to have a flag somewhere outside your home
Restaurants often have them, other than that it's not that common
it's not odd, you do need a permit to put up a flag pole, though
Swiss people casually wear shirts or hats or houseshoes with the flag on it
Thou 10-15 years ago more than today
I can see 10-15 flagpoles with swiss flags from my balcony
But we don‘t have that flag culture that we treat the flag as a holy object and it has to be folded in this way and stuff
No clue if it's common to have one but I definitely can't see the flag a lot when outside
The trams and buses have flags on them on important holidays (but also the cantonal flag), important buildings might have them but that's about it
The flags of the cantons can be seen more often in public
And then there's the allotment gardens where many people have flags but many of them are forgein ones
However, during the World Cup and the European Cup (or whatever it's called in English) you will see a lot more flags and during important hockey tournaments and the Olympics as well I guess
Depends where you live
In Valais, especially in the moutain, a lot of chalets have a pole with a flag
I see more people displaying flags of their canton than the national one
True, the mountain regions have plenty of flags
It's just not that common in villages or cities (I live near St
Gallen)
Oh damn, I completely forgot about the flags of cantons, those are pretty common on lamp posts or (not as often) just randomly waving in someone's garden
As for the national flag, you rarely see that one waving in public
Oh yeah for sure, in big cities it's much less common
I see more Portuguese, Spanish and Italian flags during football season than I do Swiss flags all year in my city
But definitely see a lot of Swiss flags on chalets and rural touristy places
In the cities it’s common to see the flag hanged in public, like on [bridges] for examples, but people hardly ever have one hanging around their home that’s true
The cost of living in general but the thing I hate the most is the work mentality
Constitutional sexist discrimination that demands me to either give up one year of my life or alternatively demands me to pay higher taxes
Nepotism to get good jobs
You often need connections
You got me with the “print it out” its so hilarious but at the same time makes me want to cry because it is so true
I work in Switzerland but for some reason live in Germany-after living in the Caribbean for a long time, I want to slam my head against a wall when I see my poor little children being swamped with stacks of terribly-done black-and-white copies to work through by themselves at home or sit in front of the worst, unstable, chaotic and unsafe “school learning platform” ever brought online
That'd be cheap in Switzerland
5 GB data is easily 40 - 50+ CHF (~35 - ~45+ Euros) a month (depending on what else is included)
[Example plans for Switzerland
[And another one
To be fair, the our salaries are proportionate to the cost of living, on median
I would say the constant "compromising". Everything takes forever to get done
Being able to "oppose" to basically anything is great, but makes everything have to start over too many times
Need to build a new school because of population growth
Just having authorisation by the community can take years because someone opposed to the project due to the fact that "kids are noisy".
Want to build a new metro line
Opposed, and by the time the project gets through, it's way over budget and already obsolete
Want to build a new house
Opposed because the doorway doesn't match the village esthetics
I'm aware I've only stated construction examples because I don't want to get into political stuff haha
Sure, it makes the country (usually) more stable than most, but it's a damned hassle
Edit : spelling
Yup
I have asthma and the military doctor just told me I was not able to be in the army, I asked to do the PC then and he told me no
Now I have to pay when I could have at least done the PC
It's time to accept "[Service Citoyen] (service for all citizens - but open up more ways of service)
I am a very enthusiastic supporter
what i find the most infuriating about that is the payment if you‘re double UT
I guess it makes sense so you can‘t just be like „yeah i wanna kill people“ and get double UT and be „free“. However it‘s really unfair for people who have no chance of serving at all
also the men only thing made sense when it was invented, but nowadays there should either be mandatory civil/military service for everybody, or none at all
I half disagree on this one
It is true that things end up taking longer to build, but at least once they're built they are very nicely done and everyone is happy with the outcome as everyone got their say
From what I've experienced (I'm a late millenial btw), most boomers are really set in their ways
You do it like you are supposed to, you do it because you are told so
Everything is very by the book and leaves no room for improvisation
Work hours are to be respected and and things like that
I haven't worked with zoomers that much but I think their way of working doesn't differ much from the other millenials I've worked with (all born between 89 and 95) Most are more relaxed, as long as the job is done by the times it's supposed to be done, you can work when you want
You do things in the way you want as long as it's good and you explain what you did and how you did it
Again this is just my experience but I found that boomers tend to focus on how things are done whereas younger generations only really care about the result
And for your fist question, I feel like Swiss work mentality is more like the old ways, the more you work the better
Even if you are sick you come to work because not going is mostly frowned upon, you also do unpaid extra hours
I've had many acquainances being burned out because of work, some as young as 22 years old, and some coworkers working at home on the weekends just so the boss is happy on Monday
Yeah, I can relate to your situation
It's just messed up and I unfortunately don't think it will be resolved any time soon
I will/do support that, but they have remained extremely quiet over the years since I first noticed them
Let's see how their plan works out
>open up more ways of service
PS: which in principle is already the reality for Swiss men, since in addition to mandatory military service, Swiss men also have mandatory civil defense service
In Switzerland there is mandatory military service for men only, lasting around a full year of service
If a man is unfit to serve they will pay a tax of 3% as compensation
Women are exempt from mandatory service and from the tax
That isn't true
Everyone us only half happy
Trying to satisfy makes no-one happy
So maybe you can say everyone is satisfied, but not happy
And that's when things actually get done
If I understood the Idea behind Service Citoyen correctly it'd also include things like Firefighters which are currently not covered
Spending one year of your life in service of the society you live in is more than fair
If you think what society provides for you personally I find it absolutely incomprehensible how someone could be against serving
Serving your community/society also helps with identification with that community/society
The current situation in Switzerland is that all Male citizens have to serve
They can do so either as Military Service (Military stuff), in Civil Protection Service (running and maintaining public bomb shelters, helping the civilian population in emergency situations), or Civil Service (eg
helping out in a hospital or school)
The idea behind "Service Citoyen" is to make it mandatory for all citizens to serve (yay - genderequality)
But in turn open up more ways that service can be spent, eg
by also including service as a Firefighter
Interestingly enough firefighting service once was one of the other duties that only were mandatory for men depending on the commune
But since that service was demanded by local law it was ruled unconstitutional after the equality law was implemented
they probably want to cover many different areas,. I just wanted to point out that contrary to popular believe Swiss men do not only have the duty to serve in the army but technically also the duty to serve in civil defense
Why does everyone call it "forced labor"? That's 100% the wrong comparison to draw
If it was anything like "forced labor" everyone would be opposed to it - obviously
It's not like the government get's a profit out of it, at least not in military or civil protection service, in civil service you do work for something beneficial for society, which I guess one could say the government profits off of, but it's absolutely your choice what work you do, the government doesn't tell you what to do, so again calling it "forced labor" is more than a stretch
So in one type of service it's your choice (and only your choice) what exactly you do and in the other two types you are primarily training for emergency situations, not doing any work (not saying that it isn't a demanding activity, not at all, but no direct use is gained form it so it's not work - it's training)
>perform a service of the state's choosing
**Which is not the case** \- you can choose to either do Military service or Civil service
While, yes, in the military you don't get to choose what exactly you do, the decision to do military service is entirely yours (and only about 30 - 40% do choose that path)
In Civil Service you are almost entirely free what to do, certainly no one will tell you what to do - find something that benefits society, get permission to do it as part of your civil service, do it (**You have to find what to do,** the government won't tell you
Popular options are helping out in a hospital or school, actions to help the environment (a friend of mine spent 4 weeks collecting garbage in forests for example), even just being a helping hand for families in need can qualify (During Covid working in Contact Tracing was also a popular option)
Civil Service isn't even necessarily spent in government organizations (Hospitals are generally private companies, actions for the environment are generally some sort of non-profit, etc
All the Swiss militia system (that's what the whole system is called) does is telling you to do something for your community for a fixed amount of time
Something anyone should do anyways, so what's wrong with making it mandatory
I think most people agree that doing something for your community is a good thing that everyone should do from time to time, so why don't just make it mandatory
I really struggle to see why everyone is talking about forced labor
There's absolutely non of that in the whole system
You choose one of three (or two) forms of service: yes, if choose military service you might end up having to accept orders and to what you're told, but in no way is it the case that you are forced into military service
If you choose civil service no one will tell you anything - you are literally free to do anything that benefits society, not even working for the government in most cases, non-profit organizations (eg
Environmental protection organizations) or even private companies (eg
Hospitals) are perfectly valid options - the only connection to the government is that they pay you during that time (if you are employed not even that, then the government pays your employer and they just keep paying you) .
That's absolutely true
Adding more ways of service isn't meant for "tayloring" serving to women, it's a simple necessity from sheer numbers alone
The argument usually given is that if you suddenly make serving mandatory for everyone you essentially double the amount of people, but all the existing categories are set up in a way that they are 'filled' with the current amount of people (not quite true, army and civil protection service are chronically understaffed)
Essentially doubling the amount of people in the army is not feasible politically, simmilar story in the other categories (the only exception maybe being the civil service), so to double the amount of people you also have to create some new categories
Tough to say at this point
It may even illegal by international law, which in contrast to military type services clearly forbid mandatory citizen work
To be honest with you, with respect to this particular topic, I have learnt to have very little expectations
My prediction is that Swiss men will continue to get constitutionally discriminated
There has not yet been any vote on it - so it's a bit hard to say
There are of course studies, but just because a study says it's supported by the general public does not mean it'd pass in a vote
That all said, the first study I found by googling just now said 63% of participants were in favor of the idea
Which I think is quite realistic - at least in my social circle the Idea is very popular
>You're forced to do *labour*, i.e. work, for the state
In the case of civil service you usually don't even work for the government (you are payed by them, but don't work for them); typical civil service things to do are working in a hospital (Private, or at least privatized, companies), working for some non-profit or environmental organization (WWF is a popular choice), working in schools is also a classic and among the classics is the only one where you work for the state (unless you work at a private school, which is also possible) - you can even go abroad and work for some humanitarian organization in some part of the world where help is needed
The militia system really isn't about doing work for the government - it just isn't. It's about doing good for society, be that by training for being ready to defend it (military service), training for being ready to protect/safe people in case of emergency (civil protection service) or by doing good work somewhere in society (civil service)
I think you probably agree that any of these things are good things to do, things ideally every individual should do (call it a moral obligation to do good to your community if that's your style)
What are laws good for if not to compel all people into being good people
So why not make it mandatory for people to do one of these, undoubtedly good, things things for a tiny percentage of their time
The point is that every member of society should do these things, so Switzerland made it mandatory (currently only for male citizens, but the political wheels are turning)
If you are employed, you employer is paid 80% of your average daily salary per day, and they have to pay you at least that much (as though you were still working for them), some employers continue to pay you 100% of your salary (paying the remaining 20% out of their pocket), some pay somewhere in between the 80% and your full salary - you get the picture
If you are not employed you get paid 80% of your daily average income or at least 62 CHF directly
Which for some people, for example for student like me, makes serving even interesting from a financial point of view (my average daily income is 0
- but I get 62
- a day during the four weeks of service I do every year)
In addition to that payment (called Salary replacement payment) you are also payed an additional sum per day (Greman: Sold) in cash (the exact amount depends on a multitude of factors, but it's somewhere between 5
- and 15
It's payed in cash because it's tax exempt, so it has to be cash
Do you agree that being a Firefighter, being a reservist for emergency response units (eg
helping after floods), helping out families in need or cleaning up forests is a good thing to do
Do you agree that in an ideal society everyone would spend at least a small portion of their time doing something in this vein
If yes - then you cannot be against the militia system, because that's literally all it is
Note: none of these things are things that can be done professionally, So your argument of "just hire professionals" doesn't work
Yet they either need to happen or at the very least it's a good thing that they happen - I wouldn't want to live in a society where these jobs are not done
we shall see
>so surely a lot of people would choose to do it if it were an optional program
I seriously doubt it - I wouldn't have
Yes it's financially interesting, but it's also a huge pain in the backside missing 4 weeks of Uni, not being able to attend exams if I'm unlucky (that thankfully has not yet happened)
People who are employed certainly wouldn't, employers would also very much like it if they did not have to let their employees go off for four weeks a year, having to pay them without them doing the work
Isn't that what laws are for
Mandating you to do things that one 'should do' anyways as a good human - unfortunately one usually doesn't without external pressure
Some certainly do, but it should be everyone - so it has to be mandatory
In any given town there'll be a fire maybe once a year, maybe two car crashes where the Firefighters are needed
What does that give, three days where Firefighters are usefull
Let's double that for good measure 6 days ~ 1 week
What do you with them the other 51 weeks/year
Pay them to sit around
It's just not a full time job, in cities maybe (in some Swiss cities there are professional firefighters), but outside the cities
A few weeks of basic training once, then a refresher for a day or two once or twice a year and you've got yourself a firefighter for years
They can have normal, civilian jobs through the majority of the year and on the few days a year you actually need them they're there, fully trained and ready to put out a fire or cut open a car
Same story with soldiers, 18 weeks of basic training (or more if you want to climb the ranks) once and then yearly refreshers
The Swiss army has just over 140'000 Soldiers, the vast majority (~95%) have a normal civilian job for most of the year and just go to refreshment courses for a 3 weeks (4 weeks for officers) a year
But in times of crisis they're fully trained and ready
>Laws are for creating a safe environment for everyone to live as freely  as possible
So people can make their own choices and pursue their own  desires without risk of being harmed by others
100% agree
To do so they limit each individual, mandating what they have to do and cannot do, mandating you to be a "good human", mandating you to let everyone have their freedom, just as you have yours
To allow everyone to pursue their own desires as far as possible the law sets equal (at least in theory - see equality discussions everywhere) boundaries and duties on everyone, one of these duties is serving your community
Because without that society cannot function, and everyone loses all of their freedoms
I don't know how other countries do it, it certainly is an extremely important corner stone of Swiss society
Without militia service (be that military service or civil service) , there'd be basically no Firefighters (within a margin of error there are no professional firefighters in Switzerland), hospitals would be severely understaffed, so would schools (Especially in rural areas), there'd be no one who could help after natural catastrophes/emergencies (basically all contact tracers and all other extra staff needed during the current CoVid crisis are people doing their service)
>than having to continuously train new ones that leave after a year
You obviously don't understand the system
A Firefighter trains once, for a few weeks (not quite sure how long exactly)
They are then available for service for literal years, decades even
Going about their normal civilian lives unless they're needed
Their counter of how many days they served only counts on a day when they are actually needed (or on a few training days a year)
Same with Soldiers, 18 weeks of basic training once (or longer if you want climb the ranks), then 3 weeks a year (or 4 weeks a year for officers) of repetition training for a few years, and then in reserve for years, sometimes decades
Having normal jobs, but being ready if needed
(For military service you can also do it all in one go if that's more convenient for you, but that's not the norm
What's cheaper: having professionals sitting around most days still being paid, or having a militia force being fully trained but usually in their civilian lives, with civilian jobs, not being paid by the government, but still ready when needed
In an emergency there's no difference between the two, in both cases you can call them and they will come and solve whatever problem there is
It also means that in basically every civilian environment you can imagine there are people with training in First Aid, Firefighting, other Emergency responses, Leadership (Officers) - that has a profound, positive, impact on society; That's the Swiss 'Militia' system, and yes it is deeply ingrained in our culture, but it's also extremely important for our society
I'm not saying it can't work without, I'm saying society would look extremely different if it was different
I remember a school mate got angry because Dragonball Z was interrupted by the 9/11 news

Germany (heavy cultural influence)
Italy (roman empire)
France (especially Napoleon)
Austria (Habsburg family comes from Switzerland)
Can't decide USA or GB because swiss immigrants in the US and english tourists influencing swiss culture heavily
I guess it would be all the neighbours: Germany, France, Italy, Austria and Liechtenstein which conveniently enough are exactly 5 countries
You'd also hear their respective predecessors, like the Habsburg Empire and the HRE (or as I like to call it: HRR(dN)) since the territory that is now Switzerland was in large parts owned by the Habsburgs and the Habsburgs also originate in Switzerland (Habsburg is a castle in Switzerland) and it technically was part of the HRE for quite a while too, these can be counted as Austria and Germany respectively
I suppose also hear about the kingdoms that preceeded the national states like the Kingdom of Bavaria and the Großherzogtum (Grand Dutchy
) of Baden (now Germany) and the Kingdom of Milan (I think that's what it was called) (now Italy), as well as the Roman Empire if you go back far enough which we could technically also count as Italy
But I don't know in what order they'd be, you'd probably even learn quite a lot about Liechtenstein
If I had to mention a non-neighbor, it might be Russia
Most would be:
\- Germany
\- France
\- Italy
\- Austria
My list would have the same countries but in a different order:
France, because of Napolionic Wars, the Helvetic Republic, Liberal vs Conservatives --> Sonderbundskrieg and founding of the current Swiss state
Austria (HRE), I'd put Austria in second place because it (the HRE under Austrian control) plays a big role in the Swiss mythology (1291, Tell) and played a role in the founding of the Swiss state as *the* conservative nation between Napoleon and the Vienna Conference
Germany, big neighbour and huge cultural influence, also two World Wars
(Note: I'm from the German part of Switzerland, but I'd still put France first)
Italy, neigbour, cultural infuence
USA, Swiss people emigrated to the US, we copied much of their democratic ideas into our democratic system
I would put Germany first because of the meaningfullness of swiss reformation with Zwingli and Calvin
And I know the pre march rebellion came up first in France, but because Napoleon lll
I think it's context in Germany was more important for Switzerland, since Switzerland became afterwards a beacon of democracy for other german countries
Not in every game
Except if you want to argue that the biggest trading places on Steam (TF2/CSGO) are both scams
CS:GO only got free 2 play like a year or two ago
Before it cost 15$.
Tbf, CSGO never did it as scummily as all other games
Yes, they're "lootboxes", but nobody ever complained about them before the EA fiasco
I think it's pretty unfair putting them into the same basket
In fact, those third party sites were taken down by Valve, at least those dealing with betting skins for money / skins I believe
There's still some smaller ones up, and if it's big, it's only skins for money now
So the same as CS:GO, kinda
The EU in a 100 years
The EU will be going from one crisis to another, without ever breaking up or federalising- because that's just how things work in Brussels
Meanwhile the press will be clamouring about populism, despite them continuously rising and falling in most countries, just at different times
Inequalities between Western and Eastern Europe will have decreased, with the population of the latter one eventually stabilising, but Southern Europe will completely crash and experience a severe economic crunch as the weight of mounting debt, ageing and falling population, a German economy next door in need of millions of workers and a lack of enough globally competitive companies will become insurmountable
An interesting question mark remains on who the biggest European country will be - will Germany really be overpassed by the UK and then France before the end of the century
Globally, the EU will never become the next superpower, falling to below 4% of the world's population by 2100 and with an economy that has a hard time growing
That, together with it's internal political divergences, means the EU will be, internationally, a slightly bigger Brazil in 100 years
I think 100 years might just be barely in time to achieve federalisation of the EU and implementation of a widespread quasi-communist (although it wont be called such) post-scarcity economy fueled by asteroid mining and AI
Private enterprise will still exist, but most things that can't be serviced with said factors have been slowly wound down due to unprofitability due to collapsing resource prices
But of course things like fashion houses, everything related to art, some of the more innovative, less infrastructure-y tech companies etc
will still be privately owned

Well yes, that's obvious
For Germans, the EU is more than just a politico-economic union, it's an integral part of their answer to a post-WW2 Germany, it's worldview and it's identity
And then there are 26 other countries in the Union, and a couple more outside the EU too, every single one of whom lack this overwhelming sense of a national re-collection / self-imposed need to redeem themselves
The ~~C~~CCP, maybe
I think Central Asia is growing
Central Asia reestablishing the USSR and "inviting" Russia would be far from the wackiest thing that happened in history
French pro-EU sentiments is not comparable to the connection within the German people's national conscience between the EU and the end of the Third Reich

Low Saxon died out because it didn't have any real actors (and I don't mean NGOs or cultural clubs, I mean state-level actors like a proper government) pushing for its use
And no, being "officially recognised" doesn't count
History has shown time and time again that the only way to permanently guarantee language survival is if the ethnolinguistic region in question is internally self-governing*. We Swiss try to keep Romansh (which doesn't have its own sub-state) alive at all costs (we are far from monolinguist supremacists), and while I wouldn't say it's dying, it's negatively stagnating despite us doing everything "right". This wouldn't be the case if Rhaetia had been an independent state for 1000 years
\* I don't mean to say the Netherlands couldn't be internally self-governing within the EU
Clearly the Netherlands is an established state, and as I said, if it happens due to being part of a bigger EU, it happens maybe over 500-1000+ years
Yes
those are unimaginable timescales
There was an episode of a regular talkshow once where they had some guys over
Topic was youth violence and so they had everything from 'normal' everyday school kids, the criminal immigrant up the hells angels
There are at least 10 memes that stem from this 1h long show
Everybody (at least in the german speaking part of Switzerland) knows this and you hear some sentences recited all the time in everyday life
Because it's funny
So yeah not a picture meme but rather multiple quotes (usually on how much of a gangster you are, how stupid/non gangster/childish the opponent is and similar) that actually get used IRL pretty frequently
We usually show this to new additions to our friend group if they didn't grow up in Switzerland
Just to educate them in a fun way and so they too get those inside jokes everybody has been using for the past 20 years
We also got other meme quotes from TV shows but they're just really random stuff
Definitely Lichtenstein
They use our currency and our military would defend them in case of an invasion
Switzerland also diplomatically represents Lichtenstein in other countries
Edit: They also speak a Swiss German dialect
I would say Liechtenstein since it really doesn't even feel like it's a different country
They use the Swiss currency, have the same phone numbers, same phone providers, their dialect is similar to the bordering region in Switzerland, their licence plates are like the Swiss licence plates but with white text on black background and the letters FL (for Fürstentum Liechtenstein) instead of the abbreviation for a canton
Liechtenstein feels more like a loosely attached small 27th canton (even most cantons are bigger) than like a separate country
When the borders closed in Europe due to the coronavirus, the border between Switzerland and Liechtenstein remained open while all the others closed
With this 'little brother' nation covered, we now have the 'big brother'. This isn't the same country for all of Switzerland since not everyone speaks the same language
So it's just the country where your language is also spoken (doesn't exist for our 4th language): For Ticino it's Italy, for the Romandie it's France, and for the rest it's Germany (our German is very different but we write in standard German so it still counts), more than Austria
I suppose this is because it's quite hard to get to Austria because the entire border is mountainous so there are only two routes you can use if you want to go to Austria
The border with Germany however is just along the Rhine River (more or less) in relatively flat territory
Also Germany is way bigger
None really
Germany and France are of course close to us in some ways but in some ways hey're also definitely not
Plus, Germans and French know very little about Switzerland although Swiss people know a lot about Germany and France, so the relationship feels very unequal
If I had to pick one, I'd say Japan
Switzerland and Japan are in many ways quite similar despite the vast geographic distance in between
Both our mentalities as well as the way we perceive our country in the context of the international community has many parallels
Japan is also the only country that has ever been genuinely interested in Swiss culture without displaying a condescending attitude at the same time
Probably Liechtenstein and Austria
It's not just he language (German speaking part of Switzerland), but also the 'mountain culture' I would say
And we accidentally invaded them a couple of times, so they basically belong to us now
Hug me, brotha
I agree, I did a cultural exchange in Japan and it was very interesting how much most Japanese people actually know about us
(they don't know much of course, but it's relatively impressive)
I totally agree about the part about Japanese people being interested in our culture or country in general without being condescending
There is (well, was because of the virus) a tonne of Japanese tourists here and they are so nice and pleasent
Compared to tourists from let's say France to pick a neighbouring country, they don't act superior but curious and interested
A tourist from France, especially the ones with lots of money or that come from a place like Paris, will tend to say things like "Comme c'est pittoresque" or "Comme c'est original" which are very condescending phrases
(Not all French tourists of course but you get what I'm saying)
They don‘t have their own military anymore
We basically share our military with them
So they technically can’t invade us
It isn’t that big of a deal
They’re neutral too and I feel like militarily Switzerland and Lichtenstein basically are one country (and have been for a long time) since we have a common military
We don't really see it as "another" country
At least I don't. They are very close to us, they use our currency, our post stamps and we even speak the same language
When I grew up my parents always made it clear to me that people in our country may be different (different languages and cultures) but that we are all swiss for the same reason
I still see Liechtenstein as a part of this
We basically consider them the "27th Swiss Canton" (canton = state)
The main reason they never joined Switzerland is probably that they have a monarchy, which obviously wouldn't be possible to keep
And they're doing great with the current arrangements, so why change a system that works
We leave again afterwards ;)
Yeah I met a lot of people from Liechtenstein during university and I was never be able to tell until they told me themselves
And I keep forgetting they aren't Swiss
Pour avoir eu une ex Française, j'ai entendu pas mal de trucs sur les Suisses
Mais c'est vrai qu'on est pas mieux
Mais dans mon commentaire je parlais juste des touristes, pas forcément d'autres situations
\*sad Swiss noises\*
Now you're a bit harsh, Switzerland is not *that* isolated
It is, but not as much as you said
But generally you're right, a big part of the culture of Switzerland is not being like Germany/France/Italy
We *want* to be distinct from our neighbours
We (Swiss-Germans) look at Germany like a big brother in whose shadow we are
Sometimes it is even a bit frustration and distrust
This is a reason why we would relate to Austria, which, to our *understanding*, is in a similar situation like us
I'm not sure how it is for the French and Italian speaking part, but I believe at least for the French-speaking part there is a similar sentiment towards France
From our neighbouring countries I like Germany the most
They are nearly the only one who take us seriously in European and international matters
The French say it is our own fault we are isolated and don't really want to help, the Italians have their own problems and Austria is too small to really do anything
In the negotiation for the bilateral treaty with the EU, Germany often is on our side, while the EU has a similar sentiment like France towards us
L'espagnol, l'italien, le portugais, pas trop de probleme a comprendre ces langues

It is ultra-symmetric
I let the people from [r/grouptheory/] decide on [how symmetric]
Especially the proportions
The government gives me 300 CHF a month per kid as an allowance
Do they know about it
They're toddlers
One could interpret that as rent
When I started my apprenticeship my parents asked me to pay 10% of my salary to help cover the expenses like food, rent etc
We were an average middle class family
I know of other young people who had to financially contribute
It's not unheard of, but I don't think it's usual everywhere and in every family
After I finished my education and got a fulltime job, I set up a fixed amount (CHF 500
-) that goes straight to my parents each month
It's not much, considering rent, food, internet access, etc would cost me much more if I lived alone
I always saw it as a compensation for the obligatory basic health care
My mom kept receiving the same money even though I moved out almost three years ago and pay for almost everything myself (because I'm still at uni, so they technically are still required to finanfially look out for me)
My parents pay my health care which is roughly the same amount
Yeah, it depends a lot on the family
It's common enough to not be weird, but not as common as to assume it's the rule
I pay about 3k a month for daycare
That's why
School is literally the cheapest part of having a child in Switzerland
Everything else is what's expensive
They might be higher but everything is more expensive so that balances out
really weird drunk german according to a german friend
Are you describing Swiss German
Bruh, I have learned Swedish
Danish is a throat condition
and romansh, yeah
no, but swiss german do sound kinda weird i suppose
France
For their revolution
It's what's set us up to be the country we are today
Thank you Germany for almost always siding with Switzerland in international/EU matter
Thanks Germany for not invading us in WW2
Except if you're Swiss
Nobody ain't got something to thank the Swiss for it seems
Edit : Thanks for the thanks guys o/ I appreciate it
Now I have "Fighters in exile" of Sabaton in my head
> Fighter pilots in exile fly over foreign land
>Let their story be heard, tell of 303rd
>Fighter pilots from Poland in the battle of Britain
>Guarding the skies of the isle
*That's* the biggest thanks you could imagine
Not, you know, them being the reason you're being independent (they lent their navy to destroy the British's, fyi)
Stalin did that
Wow
talk about two sides of a coin with that guy
Same
> and no one hates
Well, back in the day there was this [Gadaffi] guy because we arrested his son
But you see [where] hate towards Switzerland gets you (sarcasm)
Edit : But thanks for that compliment, not everything's perfect though as we are quite foreigner opposed sadly
I hope it'll be gone one day
Uhm
CERN, red cross, geneva convention just to name a few
Also, some thanked for food
Swiss chocolate and cheese comes to mind
We do stuff, it just gets buried I suppose
Well, I doubted that Sabaton could put all squadrons in a single song, but thanks for clearing it up
Sabaton also mentions the squadrons of other countries (Czechoslovakia and Canada I believe)
To be fair, you did kind of force them to become communist states and caused the iron curtain
I doubt that us being a middleman didn't help a lot in the negotiations
I doubt that anything of that significance would've happened without one
And about CERN, well you're right I suppose
I'm not saying we shouldn't be grateful, but today's Germany's relationship with Poland outweighs the relationship to the USSR in WW2
Germany isn't fascist anymore mate
This is not a talk Russia vs
NATO
Please don't turn it into one, especially as I couldn't give less fucks as I'm Swiss and we're not even in NATO
If you want to argue, do it about the actual topic on hand and not some NATO vs Russia crap

Probably the ETH  for natural sciences, other than that it doesn't really matter I guess
(Basel is the oldest tho)
The Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich (ETH Zürich)
It roughly translates to federal technological college zürich
If i remember it correctly it is also because Einstein used to teach there or maybe he was studying there while developing his famous theory of relativity
Edit: Einstein studied there
(And he actually was a good student)
After that he worked in Bern at the Swiss patent office, and during that time developed his theory of relativity
Thanks u/JimSteak
In terme of prestige, it's certainly ETH Zurich
Gallen also holds a high reputation for its business school
i’d say Uni SG is famous for it’s economics and law courses but that might just be the stereotypes, idk
Einstein studied there

Ahh yess, forgot HSG for economics
I'm not rivh enough to go there  (stereotypical the university for rich lawyer-sons, there's tons of memes)
haha yeah, i’m just not interested in economics so idk much about the different unis that offer these courses except HSG from the memes
I don't know but I always forget that Moldova exists
It's just there
I don't hear or see anything about it, not in the news, not in movies, not anywhere
The only thing I know about it is that O-Zone (the group who made the Numa Numa song) is from there
Switzerland is so boring, it has a whole sub dedicated to proving it doesn't exist: r/SwitzerlandIsFake
I only think of Moldova when it's Eurovision time
Interestingly I feel that way with the sea, Lanzarote for example: the seais beautiful but without any other interesting landscape it's just

Dead body reported
How are you talking about our landscape tiddies
Country officials and employees are quite clean, especially compared to other countries
Sure, we get the occasional regional favoritism and we have a lot of politicians who work on the board of directors of large corporations but that is not secret and usually communicated well enough
Being home to many large international corporations and organizations, corruption is more often seen with influential positions there
Think FIFA or some UN figures of questionable reputation
Big corporations sure have some issues, but most arise working outside the country and don't really affect us much here
At least this is my perception
I can't really remember the exact words of my father, but wasn't it like that, you only got flats, especially in bigger, left leaning cities, if you were an SPÖ member or at least supporter
I'd say that's kind of corruption
Well explained
I feel like we swiss people are not really good at music

Zurich, not a huge city, expensive as hell,very clean, safest city iv ever seen
hear english just as much as german when you walk around downtown,estimates are about 50% of the city are foreigners
Bern, Switzerland: Apparently we have 200k inhabitants, it feels more like a village sometimes
I can walk home from any party or bar
I keep meeting people I know unexpectedly when I go anywhere
The city is more chilled than any other I know
People are reaaaalllllyyyy relaxed
Do you live in Thessaloniki
Well my Athenian friend claims that everyone in Thessaloniki is crazy but maybe this is just Athenian propaganda
I think Athens is very nice but also kinda not, depending on where you are
It has clearly been better though (a few millenia ago)
Since I'm a big fan of trains (and I also care about the environment), I'd absolutely love for Europe to build one big, interconnected system of high-speed trains
I understand that some countries already have such trains but what I'm looking for is a unified network: the trains would all look the same and they would be owned/maintained by one public company
There would be a European fonds where each country would be required to pay into
The money would be used to build and maintain the infrastructure across the continent, so that you won't be able to feel much of a quality difference
Train stations for this particular high speed train would look just as nice and modern in, say, Ukraine, as they would in France
Architects and engineers should take inspiration from Japan and South Korea, where the high speed networks look super nice, clean and ultra-modern
The European network would make it possible to traverse long distances without having to get off and change in between
For example I'm envisioning a direct connection between Lisbon and Moscow or Palermo and Hammerfest (of course there would be stops in between for people to get on/off)
I know it's a bit utopian but you told us to think big, so yeah, this would be pretty awesome
Edit: By "high-speed" I mean somewhere around the 400 km/h mark
This would get you from Lisbon to Moscow in roughly 12 hours (disregarding stops in between) or from Athens to Hammerfest in roughly the same amount of time
Nuclear power plants to cover 100% demand
We should stop wasting resources on renewables, it goes nowhere
I interpret the question as a pure fantasy wish, because of that I raise your suggestion to a **maglev** network
This
Although the train network in most of Europe is already pretty good
I travel regularly between Zürich and Warsaw and I always take train
Just before the pandemic hir I was on vacation in northern Finland, all the way from Zürich and back by train (and a bit by ferry)
You can get almost everywhere on the contingent by train
Flying is no fun
I think the idea was that each station gets a similar budget
I do agree that it would be cool for each country to have their own style station or something
I would argue that modern-looking buildings can be well-integrated into a historical cityscape *if done right*. A good example is the opera in Hamburg
It is very modern-looking and surrounded by historical buildings but somehow the architects (Herzog & DeMeuron) managed to fit it in really nicely
Besides, our cities are being continuously mixed up with more modern looking buildings anyway
I mean, I absolutely love that 18th and 19th century architecture but we're not in the 18th or 19th century anymore, so it would be a bit strange to build like that
Zurich now has a skyscraper with glass facades amidst all the historical buildings
When construction finished 15 years ago or so, people were complaining how it's going to destroy the cityscape but in the meantime, most inhabitants have come to like the new tower
And they STILL open new coal plants (at least one this year, that basically balances a nuclear plant closed down few weeks earlier)
>Yeah travelling by train is so much easier and more comfortable than travelling by car or plane
I would go further than that and say it's genuinely enjoyable
Travelling across Europe by train is an experience I hope everyone gets to enjoy once in their lifetime
Imagine selling it like this:
*We've been working on this concept
Like a theme park ride, but much bigger
And instead of mock attractions, you get to ride through real world landscapes and cities with people in it
*You'll ride in roomy carriages, sheltered from the weather, with huge windows right by your seat
The ride will even have a fully fledged restaurant on it, as well as restrooms
*In a matter of hours you'll encounter vastly different landscapes and cities
From plains to forests, across rivers, valleys and montains
There will be small villages and towns, as well as large urban areas
*The languages you see will change, as will the architecture
Crossing international borders will be completely hassle-free, you won't even have to leave the ride
*You can even go on the ride overnight, and sleep in your own little bunk bed, and get breakfast in the morning
If you wake up at night, you might find that you crossed into an entirely different country, and look out into the streets of an unfamiliar city in a far away land
*Or you might open the window, and catch that unmistakable smell of a warm summer night somewhere in rural Italy
This so much

There are some photos and reports if you scroll my post history back to February
Flying is no fun
Yes
Unfortunately, the thing is, you cannot have all three:
stable energy supply
no new fossil fuel deployments
phase out of nuclear
you need to give one up
Giving up (1
) is a no go
So given the choice of (2
) and (3
) Germany chose 3
The best option in my opinion is to go via Basel and Berlin
You depart at 9am from Zürich and you are in Warsaw around 10pm
The problem is that the change in Berlin is rather tight
However, Deutsche Bahn will sell you a single ticket for the whole trip, so if the train to Berlin is delayed, it's their problem not yours
Thanks to the EU passenger rights regulations they need to offer you accommodation, and pay you some compensation for the delay
There is also a similar connection the other way
You leave Warsaw at 8:30am or something like that, change in Berlin, and you are in Zürich around 11pm
If you like night trains, there is NightJet from Zürich to Berlin
So you depart in the evening, have comfortable night on train (the rhytmic sound of a train makes me sleep really well), and in Berlin you catch the first train to Warsaw
Another option is to go via Vienna or Bratislava
There is direct RailJet from Zürich to Bratislava (or at list there was one before the pandemic messed up everything)
The problems are that you either have a very short change (and you cannot buy a single ticket, so if you miss your connection, the railways won't help you out), or you stay overnight there
That's where Bratislava comes in – hotels there are significantly less expensive than in Vienna
As for countries: on Berlin route you only cross two borders: CH->DE->PL
But on the Bratislava route, there are seven borders: CH->LI->AT->DE->AT->SK->CZ->PL
The train doesn't stop in LI and DE, but goes through their territories
We're on the same page
It's not an extremely known joke, but I've seen a few memes where it says that the entire canton of Jura isn't actually real, as pretty much no one knows people from Jura
There’s this sub r/Switzerlandisfake
But outside of reddit I don’t think we have one, at least not here in the french speaking part
If you admit that you are from Bielefeld, you've got more problems than arguing with people over its existence
I know more people from Liechtenstein than from Jura, while I've never been to Liechtenstein but I'm pretty sure I've been to Jura
> Making reference to a Bürgersprach – the equivalent of a US town hall meeting – she had attended in Bielefeld, she said: “...so es denn existiert” – “if it even exists”. “Ich hatte den Eindruck, ich war da”, she said – “I had the impression I was there
I hope I can go back”; “Ich hoffe, ich darf wieder hinfahren”.

I mean, while not part of the "new" Switzerland, Napoleon still had rule over Switzerland for an amount of time
So everyone would be called Napoleon
Nice
Isn't the Kingdom of Italy technically the Duchy of Savoy
Napoleon didn't rule directly he just initiated the Helvetic Republic and and when that didnt work he "helped" us to form a new order
So the government was still our own during those times
We just had his sword in our back
Ahh, got it
Misremembered it then
Until the German Empire was ended in 1918, the Kingdom of Prussia was the German Empire
[Source]
But technically we were part of some larger German Monarchies and the frankish
So for example I think we were part of Charlemagnes rule
Theoretically, yes
But as it happens Switzerland before the modern state was divided into own republics
For example, Bern was a Free Imperial city (until the end of the 17th century) after the extinction of the Zähringer House
So, there wasn't some parasitic prince inbetween; Bern was supposed to pay their taxes directly to the emperor
"Supposed" bcs whom to pay your taxes to, if it is not clear who the real emperor was

In Switzerland, there's a motorway where construction started in 1970
In 1975, a first section of the motorway was completed - and then all works stopped, since a commission was reevaluating the motorways
There was some local protests against the project, as well
So for a few miles there was an empty motorway running sometimes directly parallel to local roads
Here are [some] [old] [pictures]
Eventually, in 2001, the further extension of the motorway got approved again, and the complete motorway finally opened in 2009

You can on interrail :) If you are traveling across few countries, it is usually the best option
But otherwise, I agree
For example, I can book a single ticket Zurich-Warsaw via Berlin
But if I want to go via Vienna or Bratislava, I need to book separate tickets
To make it worse: it is impossible to book the Bratislava-Warsaw ticket online
You need to go the the counter, and ask for it in Slovak
(I managed to do that in Polish, but English was no go
Any Slovaks reading this: please explain)
OTOH, you cannot buy a single ticket [Szczytno-Kwidzyn] Last time I tried, I had to buy three separate tickets in three different counters
**THREE**. I don't know if I would be successful without being able to speak Polish
I somehow doubt it
So being able to book a single ticket from Switzerland to Poland online is sorta surprising
They are working on that: [ And apparently locals don't like it: [
Ooooh, thank you for the hints about buying tickets online
Very appreciated, I'll give it a try next time
Almost :) Your gauge is 4mm wider than Russian (1524mm vs
1520mm)
That's because Russia changed their standard at some point to be more "metric", while Finnish is still imperial (exactly 5ft)
That means that trains aren't fully compatible, but it is possible to build trains that can ride both, so Helsinki-St Petersburg trains don't need to switch locos at the gauge break
BTW, you have really cool trains up there
I took the Kolari-Helsinki night train back in February
The powerful diesel locos in frozen arctic create the feeling of taking a Real Train

Case on point: any Batman games
I would love to be able to speak more languages (fluently)
Especially French, as I learned it for years in school but could never speak it properly
If I could speak 40 languages fluently I would probably still think it's not enough
Absolutely, I feel comfortable speaking two (plus Swiss german dialect), and I can speak some Italian and French
But for the latter two it's barely enough to get around and my abilities should be better, considering that I've learned both languages in  school (same is true for Latin, but let's ignore that one for now)
I'm currently in the process of re-learning Italian, through an online language course and my lifetime goal is to be able to fluently speak all four national languages of Switzerland
In case I'll achieve that in a reasonable time (I doubt it), I'd would love to learn Irish as I find it an exceptionally beautiful language
At 17 i was able to speak 4 languages (B1+) and only when i met some foreigners in a language school in France, i realised that it was a lot
I still want to learn even more languages
I feel like the ones i already speak are only a foundation and nothing special
I feel the same about German so I understand
Probably the [explosion at Mitholz] (Wikipedia article in German) in 1947
Technically it was multiple explosions as it was an entire ammunition depot that burned
It destroyed the entire village of Mitholz, collapsed the whole mountain side in which it was built, killed 9 and injured 7 people
Because the fire initially caused a row of smaller explosions that were heard and seen in Mitholz the people had time to evacuate, without that the death toll would have been much higher
Edit: [Before] and [after] pictures of the mountain side
I literally made myself some warm milk to drink after school today
My family loves milk, my brother used to drink a litre of it a day and we always use it for breakfast
In Swiss German, "im Cacao/Caco" is often used for a particularly remote area
Sometimes the fictitious place "Hintertupfigen" is also used
If it is supposed to be particularly far away, it's often Honolulu
"Au trou du cul du monde" - the ass hole of the world, in French
We have a lot of wine too, aswell as we were/are also racist especially in ww2 when we denied entrance for jewish refugees
Germany gets all the jew hater fame
And the whole world measures screen size in inches
Everyone is a hypocrite
Everytime I'm in Italy the intial greeting seems to be "Prego". Which I guess you could say is even more polite
This is starting to become an odd competition lol: Heey we hated the Jews too
Why do the German gets all the credits
Bonjour
Is this only you or do Portugese and Brazilians not intermingle on the internet
The US and the UK are a special case, as there are lots of L2 speakers that are on English language websites
But I know how it is for German and there, each country has of course their own websites, especially for politics but for other topics, the websites are often not country specific (e.g. gaming or other hobbies)
You also can see this here on reddit where there are country specific subreddits but /r/de is the main German speaking channel for everybody speaking German and not only Germany
Which BTW often leads to interesting small cultural clashes
As others have pointed out, skyscrapers and old towns dating back to medieval times generally don't mix
The US on the other hand did not have such old towns, so I guess it was easier to sacrifice buildings that were only 100-200 years old for a skyscraper
the thing is we don't want a skyline except maybe one like this
most of us don't like or outright reject and despise modern architecture
but now imagine a skyscraper or even several in a place like this
I think it only works when you do it like in Paris and basically build an entire new city far away from the historic city (la dèfense) or to a certain degree like in London or Berlin where due to war damage there are already a lot of modern buildings inbetween so if you've already got a lot of contrasting styles you might as well just fully embrace it (London does it a lot better though imo)

Par chez nous on dit "caché ou pas, j’arrive". (Hidden or not, here I come)
I'm coming
I think that rarely ever happens, most germans (or austrians) i know who moved to switzerland kept their vocabulary and accent
Tbh, i think it sounds wierd if people only copy the vocabulary and not the accent
And since we all understand each other anyways there’s not really a point in changing
Its different however if you as a swiss person speaking swiss german go abroad to germany or austria
We have some words adopted from french  (example: Bicycle: German = Fahrrad, Swiss german = Velo, Wallet: German = Brieftasche, Swiss german = portemonnaie)
So for us we have to adapt if people want to fully understand us
I wouldn't mind, but French people usually use Swiss French words to mock us, not to adapt
They don't even bother using our numbers when coming here
Sometimes I hear ppl in Germany trying to make the swiss dialect and they always mess it up
It sounds so cringey
It's sad
With my experience, I would have to disagree
I've worked with many French people and have a few Belgian and French friends in my social groups, and they really tried to use our words, especially the numbers
Even 80, which can be used either way in Switzerland
There is obviously some mocking when they discover a new swiss word they hadn't heard before, but I mean, I do the same with words from other cantons or countries
I live in Lausanne, perhaps in other places or social circles it's different
iirc the French changed to the "four twenties ten" stuff later, Belgians and Swiss still say "septante, huitante, nonante" for 70, 80 and 90, a bit like in other latin languages or even English
Maybe I was just unlucky and met the wrong people, but the majority were line that
Usually wealthy tourists coming on vacation in Valais so maybe that's why they felt superior, because they came in zje mountain in a more rural area
Ah, tourists
Yes, I assume they may be nastier than immigrants, definitely
Oh yes, immigrants always (at least in my experience) try to fit in as much as possible while not forgetting their origins
As it should be
I've been an immigrant in other countries half my life, and I always do my best to blend with the locals, and I've only ever had good experiences :)
And I am myself the son of an immigrant family (my mom and her side of the family) I always enjoy different cultures and I can't wait to travel again !
**Germany:** The staring
Oh the staring
Also, the constant need to be in front of other cars when driving is also a bit odd to me
(Meaning: Let's say I'm in the autobahn, going 135 on the rightmost lane
Car behind me will overtake me and then slow down to 130
You'll see another car do likewise to him/her, and this continues on and on)
**France:** The incessant complaining, specially when it doesn't pertain to them
Example
Compared to Switzerland, neighboring France had much more stringent quarantine measures due to the COVID-19 virus
Government officials from the French regions bordering Switzerland were complaining that the Swiss weren't under the same strict measures and that it was unfair
To which a Swiss Government official clapped back with a statement implying "cultural differences" between the residents of both countries
**Italy:** All the irrational rules some people have with food
Example : Italian coworker of mine says she doesn't eat Asian noodle dishes that contain meat because in Italy you don't eat them together
But seafood is okay because that's normal in Italy
So she is okay eating Shrimp Pad Thai but won't eat Beef Pad Thai
HUH
Likewise, drinking a cappuccino in the afternoon
Faux pas
I just can‘t understand why all of our neighbouring countries went to war over something
Just stay neutral folks
Thought of a few more
Wanted to get the scoop from locals as to where to eat in Firenze, so I asked a kind looking Italian man if he recommended a good place to eat
Looks at me
Dead pan serious
"la casa di mia mamma
" And no he wasn't inviting us over, he was just postulating for who knows why
By the way, this isn't the first time I've heard that answer
A lot of Italians answer the same way
Why
How is that of any help
Probably just cheaper
Our german subsidiary still refuses to give up Fax
I frequent r/soccer, and their disdain for non-English people being fans of English teams is unbearable to me
The delightfully labelled "PLASTICS".
IIRC they built their railway with a wider gauge to make it harder for invading armies to use them
I agree
But I think she means larger chunks of meat (specially chicken), not meat sauces/pastas
But it's not just her, I've been scolded (sometimes jokingly/other times passive aggressively) by Italian friends/coworkers/waiters for things that I did't even know were rules
Some other examples
+ No cheese on seafood dishes
Asked for some Parmigiano to put on my Spaghetti Alle Vongole
You shouldn't do that
+ Want to put hot sauce on ANY pasta/pizza
You shouldn't do that
+ Want to eat pizza with your hands at a restaurant
You shouldn't do that
List goes on
Another example
Was driving through a small road with my French colleague and he went off about how a tree has collapsed on the road and no one has cleared it up for days
Lo and behold, we get to that part of the road and cars are queued up driving around the tree
The tree was probably 20 cm in diameter, and could be dragged off the road quite easily
Me: "Why
don't you just clear it yourself
I mean
we can do it now if you'd like
Him: "That's the job of the mairie, not mine
Me: F' me
Until you're no longer the first
That's my point
I live in the Swiss-French portion of Switzerland
But wouldn't surprise me if what you wrote it true
Regarding the nose picking
Maybe something of that region as well
Here it's coughing and sneezing without trapping it that gets of my nerves
Specially in public transport (pre Corona Virus)
I've been to small Portuguese stores/restaurants that didn't accept card payments or any note larger than 50 EUR
Mairie is town hall/local admin office for those that may not know
Plastics are resented all over, but at least on r/soccer the British are obnoxious about it
I'm talking, they will look through you profile/comment history to find out where you live to call you a plastic
Which is the irony (to me) considering this is being written on reddit
It's happened to me multiple times
Just let people like whatever they want to like
Lol my Portuguese colleague cuts up his spaghetti into tiny pieces (like long grains of rice)
I thought my Italian friend was gonna have an aneurysm
People in New Zealand LOVE putting "tomato sauce" on pizza
I like the sentiment of your reply, but it's honestly hilariously pretentious, and you sound like the coworker I was talking about
Why I don't buy it at all
She claims all this mumbo jumbo about delicacy, simplicity, tradition, and blah blah, just like you did
But we went out for sushi because she was gushing about how she LOVES sushi
Guess what she orders
Sushi rolls that are deep fried, covered in Mayonnaise and teriyaki sauce, served with mango and avocado, and just generally look like Tekashi69
Not to mention bathes them in soy sauce/fake wasabi
Oooh sushi
That's when I realized some people are full of sh
t, and don't really know what they believe
Mine is having to eat carbs and proteins separately
That's how they were meant to be eaten
(imo)
Think I know what you mean
I had similar experiences on the portions of the autobahn without speed limits, where I'm overtaking cars (using the left most lane), going an insane 170+. But from my rear view mirror I see another car quickly approaching using the left lane exclusively
Soon enough you hear the roar of an engine, and I have to quickly step aside to let a AMG/Porsche type car fly past me at what has to be at least 220+.
My car shakes/trembles as it passes
By the way
> Fish + cheese just doesn't go together
I take it you've never tried the gloriousness that is a Filet-O-Fish
Bruh
They call ketchup tomato sauce
I'm pulling your leg
I'm saying one can't be pretentious about one cuisine (usually their own), and then hold the complete opposite opinion/views on another
In my coworker's case
Sushi
"Pineapple on pizza is an abomination
But mango in a sushi roll is A-MA-ZING
It's the same basic principle, is what I'm saying
On that note, I absolutely adore Greek seafood dishes
But Mydia Saganaki
Sorry
adding some hot sauce on them
That's how I like it
You're missing the point
I'm not saying Italian palates are pretentious
I'm saying it's pretentious to gatekeep Italian food (or any food) as something that can only be eaten this way, with this combination of ingredients, at this hour of the day
WHILE, being completely oblivious of the same for other cuisines
It's pretentious to claim Italian fish dishes are delicate and can only be served this particular way, and on the other side asking that your Japanese fish dish be marinated in Mayonnaise, sugar and soy sauce and have it be served by someone that will make a volcano out of an onion and a heart shape with the fried rice
Hope that makes more sense
It's like you didn't even read what I wrote
Speaking of being pretentious
Disagreeing
Not at all
Claiming your own response is "eloquently" written
Kind of
But then again, you are THE "Talented Time Traveler". So apologies for my shortcomings
In Switzerland, *bostitch* is used as the generic word for a stapler
Also Babyfon, Bobbycar, Carrerabahn, Föhn, Jeep, Labello, Whirlpool, Aspirin, Pampers
probably a lot more
Man, in Switzerland it's just "Klebstreifen" ("Chläbstreife")
wait
föhn is a brand
It never occurd to me how awesome Drachenviereck actually sounds
Hell yeah, geometry
Older British man upon stumbling upon the queues for immigration in a foreign country (One for nationals and one for foreigners)
Where do I bloody stand
I'm neither Moroccan or a Foreigner
Well, they wouldn't see themselves as foreigners if they invaded 1/3 of the world
I can confirm tourists have a death wish
Every winter there’s news of some tourist dying or almost dying in the Alps because they ignored safety warnings, like hiking or skiing in an area marked with high avalanche danger, thinking they don’t need a guide to climb a mountain or a glacier, or that they can still do it with the wrong equipment or under bad weather
The mountains can be dangerous, don’t go out there thinking you know better and that it won’t happen to you anyway
Family friend of ours was visiting the Seven Sisters and was asked by a young Korean tourist to take a picture of her "jumping" (not off the cliff but up/down)
She slipped and fell to her death
Horrible
Wait wat
Are Americans shitting money or are houses just that cheap
> you disagree with
I don't think it's a simple disagreement
I've never heard of it and I'm from Switzerland
Wait wat
Now I know why Americans feel like they need a gun to protect them, the intruder can come in from everywhere
Never heard of but that's cool
Would you recommend it for tourism ? I may come to Hamburg some day :)
No, that doesn't exist in Switzerland
Bern is not actually that important of a city if it weren't for the capital
It's not even the largest city in the country
It's certainly beautiful for its historic architecture and I love the fact that it's very slow-paced, which is unusual for capitals, but it's not that important
And people from Bern (as well as everyone else) know this
If at all, it would be Zurich people who look down on the rest of the country but they don't. Ironically, in Switzerland it's the complete opposite from Hungary: the people who live in Zurich don't look down on other regions but other regions definitely look down on Zurich and its inhabitants
There are a ton of regional rivalries within Switzerland what one thing that everyone can rally around is hating Zurich lol
I've often heard people from other cities/regions say that Zurich folks are arrogant and unfriendly but I can't really agree with that
Although I'm not from Zurich myself, I've never made any bad experiences
I'd say that overall Swiss French people don't care about Zurich but feel that way about Geneva
Nah, they still want all the money Zurich pays to other cantons in the federal financial redistribution program ;)
Never seen so much odd dressed people as in England
it's not because they just don't care and are dressed bad cause negligence, they actively choose the weirdest style and are often the nicest and really cultivated people
In Switzerland, this is a very normal thing
For example a lot of Swiss people go weekend-shopping across the border to Germany or France because pretty much everything is much cheaper over there
A lot of people also live in Germany/France and work in Switzerland because wages are far higher here, so they cross the border twice a day
My wife and I sometimes go out for dinner to Germany
It can be fun because all the restaurants that people over there consider "fancy" or "luxurious" have prices that would be considered totally average here
So we get to feel a little bit like kings
It takes us about 20min to the Swiss-German border by car and about 1 hour to the Principality of Liechtenstein
France is a bit farther away, at 3 hours
Italy takes 3-4 hours depending on traffic
during normal circumstances, people who live close to the border go to Germany weekly for shopping, because Switzerland has stupid high prices
Swiss here near the German border
Although Switzerland is not in the EU, it's in the Schengen area
ID is enough, but it needs to be shown only very rarely when crossing the border
We go shopping over there, as the German prices are easily half the Swiss prices, except maybe electronics
Additionally, the German VAT of  usually 19%/7% is returned to the Swiss shoppers, such making even electronics cheaper
If one shops for more than 300 CHF = approx
300$, then the Swiss ask for their VAT of 7
7%/2
5%, so that's still a good rebate
Below 300 CHF per person the Swiss don't bother
Thus the cars often carry 4 passengers
Other than that, on sunny weekends, we often visit German Beer gardens at the Northern shores of Lake Constance, because unlike at the Swiss Southern shores you face the sun
Gf and family are all living in neighbouring countries, I visit them 1-2 times a month, then 3-4 times for holidays, plus I sometimes go shopping in Germany :) passport is not needed btw, just an idea withing the shengen Area (not only the EU)
When I was a kid we would go weekend trips to italy and austria every few weeks
Crossing a border is nothing more than passing a roadsign nowadays
But I still remember how it was before, kids these days don’t realizetheir luck
I’m moving to Switzerland next year for college (with egregious tuition fees of about $1700/year /s), so I’ve been going back and forth between France and Switzerland progressively moving my stuff there
To live there I need to file one 6 page paper, have some form of ID and the proof that I’m enrolled in a Swiss university and voilà! I can move to Switzerland
This is just tremendous
For swiss people it’s very common to cross the border
I live close to the german border and often go shopping there
It’s a lot cheaper
Just don’t go on weekends
Then it’s just crazy traffic and long queues for everything
Only in terms of borders though
Culture, mentality and customs still vary significantly from country to country and of course laws and languages also
While in Switzerland the Swiss drivers license is a valid ID
Can do pretty much all the same things you can do with the ID card
Except, like you said, it won't be one abroad
I think Corsica really would like France to forget they exist xD
Better bankrupt than French, am I right
I live in the south of switzerland and it took me 20 years of life to realize that "classeur" wasn't an italian word
I ain't no linguist, i just heard it being used by literally everyone for my whole life and just assumed it was italian
Or just pyjamas
Fo you use that in Germany as well
Ah ok
Yeah boxers/shirt is the same here
Serbian or Albanian id assume
Maybe Portoguese now
Stats for Switzerland: (from wikipedia)
(N) stands for national/official languages
German (N) 64%
French (N) 22
Italian (N) 8
English 5
Portuguese 3
Albanian 2
Serbo-Croatian 2
Spanish 2
Turkish 1
Romansch (N) 0
I think it’s Serbian as well
But of course this is excluding the official languages; otherwise it would be French
I looked it up
It’s portuguese
-Foreigners living in Switzerland also contribute to the country's linguistic diversity
English and Portuguese are the most commonly spoken foreign languages in Switzerland
-Spanish, Serbian, Croatian and Albanian are also common languages in Switzerland
[source]
German is the first language so it can't be second
very, you'll smell it everywhere (at least in the cities)
Not really, though I guess because we have multiple languages, depending on where you're from you'd write it according to that language
And then you have people wanting to use English versions or one of the many variations of that (Brian, Bryan, Caitlyn, Kaitlin, etc, or whatever they are)
But those aren't "from our country".
Cyril, Cyrill, Ciril, Cirill, Cyryl, Kirill, Kyrill
Sarah is also very common in German speaking countries
I see it like 50/50
Sara(h) is a very common name and both versions seem to exist about equally
At least in my experience
It's very high
The only "call out" I'd have is that the language is very Reddit-English if that makes sense
Moved to Switzerland from Spain, went back home, then moved to Australia, then back to Switzerland
It's been around 14 years since I left Spain (left at 21) and I don't plan on going back
Recently bought a flat here in Geneva, I find living standards much much higher in this part of the world, and culture wise I always felt I fit better here
I'm married to an aussie so maybe Australia will happen again in the future, I quite like it too, but there's something special about Europe
you can get lost in the wildrenes, yes
it is just hard to get to, since it's mountains
besides, you might not want to go there because of freezing hazard
We don't have a single head of state, so unless the entire Federal Council is made up of foreigners, or at least has a majority of foreigners, I don't see anyone batting an eye
Since most people can’t even name all Counsellors, I’m sure they don’t even think about their birth place
Are there other examples of political scandals started by le canard enchaîné? I know it as a satiric newspaper not as an investigation paper
In Switzerland there is a TV-show called Kassensturz where they go after shady business practics and Republik
Switzerland is like the rich kid in school
It looks like we have friends but it's all because of the money
Lichtenstein
Can we be friends
You’re definitely our closest friend as well, since we kinda don’t like everybody
I always considered Liechtenstein as our 27th canton that isn't really one but it's just like us, plus a prince
It's a proof of love
I'd go as far and say shirts with random words on it is the rule rather then the exception for young male clothing
As an adult, I wear just plain coloured t-shirts, which can be combined/layered much better anyway
Not just regular drunk, but drunk by swamp fumes
"Rire c'est bon pour la santé"
"Laughing is good for your health", said the Swiss president while looking dead inside
Don't know if this is a breakdown, but this was hilarious
On another note, I really do find commandable that our politic personnal try hard to speak every language of the Confederacy
Love them for that
Mistehr köppel, wat du yu du wenn de biimer bräiks down
Theres a video of a right wing politican during a meeting with her companys staff and her english is horrible
see for yourself:
Explain please
Seven thinking steps  I also liked ‘pingu macht problem’ although that might not be funny to others
But
why buckets
Of all things
I mean I like a good bucket as much as the next guy but this seems a little excessive
I love it
only Germany and Austria because you automatically get to know quite a lot just by having the same language
Otherwise maybe France and GB to a small extent
We do follow a lot european politics, especially subject relates to EU, France or Germany and Italy
But I live in a heavily connected region of Switzerland
For every Swiss, our communal, cantonal and federal politics keep us busy on a regular basis (it depends the level of consciousness)
For my part, my work imply that I must follow European and International politics, so yeah, I have to be locked on that
In Europe, the most depressing countries to follow in my opinion are Italy and the Visegrad group
Even Luxembourg
I can only think of the abandoned houses, hotels and bunkers deep in the alps
It would be rather creepy walking around inside of them and even worse at night
"Gegend von Schierke und Elend" is the description of the region
Yes, the place is actually called Elend (misery)
There is another village called Sorge (sorrow or worry or whatever) in the area
Most kids start to drink at the age of 14-15 here
You can drink beer and wine at age 16 here
Before ~15, most kids are probably still interested more in Pokemon than partying, so it's largely a self-solving problem
There are currently 12 (or 21 depending on how you count \* ) parties in the Swiss parliament
In general the concept of coalitions or oppositions is not known in Switzerland (I've heard the phrase 'consensus democracy' thrown around to describe this)
Since we don't have a singular president\*\* or prime minister there's never only one party or even only one side of the spectrum in charge; the highest executive power rests in the federal council which has seven members, currently from four different parties (ranging from right to left and from liberal to conservative)
In general I think the spectrum is not only quite broad but also quite detailed
Furthermore during elections we don't vote for parties, but for candidates directly (meaning you can mix and match candidates from different parties on your list)
The only thing that is maybe not quite fair is that the federal council currently does not have a member of the green or green-lib party in it
\* The bigger parties have 'youth parties' or 'young parties' and some of those also have some seats
** there exists the title of president of the federal council, but this position is almost completely ceremonial and does not hold any more power than the other members of the federal council (primus inter pares)
we have the anti-powerpoint party, but I'm not sure what others there are
>There are currently 12 (or 21 depending on how you count * ) parties in the Swiss parliament
To add to that, there are only 6 really relevant parties
The greens (left environementalists), the SP/PS (social democrats), the CVP/Middle (christian/conservative), green-liberals (greens with a market liberal ideaset), FDP/PLR (right-liberals) and the SVP/UDC (conservative/anti immigration)
The other parties are either local parties (SolidaritéS from genève [far left], lega di ticinesi from the ticino [far right]), the far left (PdA) or Christian parties (EVP [middle-left], EDU [far right, really conservative]) or parties without a destinct profil and no real reason to still exist on it's own (BDP [middle, the same as CVP])
I'd also like to add that we get to vote on specific issues on communal, cantonal and national level several times a year
These can be things like money for a new school (communal), certain laws or things in the constitution or really just whatever
Does anyone give a shit about EDU though
Do you confuse proporz-system with consesus democracy
(because you mentioned coalitions, and they don't have anything to do with proporz)
In the bigger chamber Switzerland has a proporz voting system e.g. the parties get a relativ amount of seats to the votes for them in a specific canton (it is more complicated than that, but it's ok for now)
In the bigger chamber you vote for a specific candidate (there are only one to two seats per canton) and sometimes have to chose the lesser evil
The thing that has to do with coalitions has to to with the concordance(?)/consensus-system
It is a system where you try to find an as big of an majority as possible
The opposite of that is a competitive system, where a *small* majority rules the country and not *the most possible*.
It leads to laws that are generally supported by everyone (if not, the people can intervene through popular initiatives and referendas)
The government (actually all of the parties) have to take everyone into account when making a new law, so it doesn't directly get vetoed out by the people
When making a new law, the parliament sub-chambers (which discuss a specific topic like environement or military) and then propose a new law to the national chamber
The national chamber discusses it and tries to find the biggest consensus and then, after discussion between the upper and lower chamber, the law gets enacted
During the discussion, all possible intrest groups are asked what they think (for example unions, NGOs, big firms etc
) if everyone (or most of them) can live with the solution it will be law
In the parliament the different factions (nearly the same as parties) have different aliances depending on the topic
For example there is the "Bürgerliche Allianz" from the right and middle parties the so called "Bürgerlichen" (SVP [far right/anti-immigration], FDP [liberal-rights], CVP/Middle [conservative/christian] and green-liberals), there is the "alliance of reason" (also sometimes called pro Europe alliance) from the left to the middle-right (SP [Social democrats], greens, Middle/CVP, FDP and green-liberals), and there is also the "unholy alliance" by the left and the far right (SP and SVP) the two biggest parties
It happens sometimes but then they agree for a different, mostly opposite reason
A reason for such a broad consensus sytem is imo the popular initiatives and referendas, where the people can correct a law or propose a new one
It leads the pairlament to avoid giving reason for such
One example ist the upcoming "Korrektur-Initiative" which wants to "correct" the decision by the executive who wanted to allow weapons export in some critical countries
The people didn't like it at all and started an popular initiative
Right now it is pending until we have a vote about it
They were the one who started the referenda against the discrimination law we voted on in the beginnig of 2020
Sadly they sometimes still are relevant
Usually when it's a specific issue which some left parties and some right parties (usually SVP) support or don't support for different reasons
They basically agree on yes or no, but they give totally different reasons
For example when the SP says a law is not enough to change anything so it is better to totally reject it and make a new one than continuing with the given
The SVP often says then the proposed law is way too much and thus it should be rejected
- I pay for a premium subscription for my favorite newspaper, which includes both a digital account as well as a mail-delivered paper edition (the latter of which is much more expensive), although I only ever use the digital account
- I'm still a member of the Protestant Church and therefore pay Church taxes, although I've been an atheist for my whole life (my mom originally joined and signed me up too when I was a child but she later left the Church again and I've always been too lazy to do so)
They do some decent charity work though
- I'm still an official member of a political party and pay my annual membership fees although I'm much more active in a different party with a similar platform now
Taxes
I trust the state to direct that money where it is needed
„Meinetwegen/von mir aus“ in German would come pretty close imo, but would depend on context
i think the closest would be "stimmt au wieder", which literally translated means "true too again"
C'est pas faux
In some contexts
or just "Bref"
Neither can I for the German speaking part of our country and it really bothers me
But "fair enough" is still kind of different from all of them, because I think fair enough is something more like "okay yeah, that's actually true" and I can't think of a real German translation for that
(vlt "da haste recht" oder so)
In Swiss German I‘d say „Denhalt“, but that has a passive agressive touch too
„Minetwege“ is probably pretty accurate, „vo mir us“ interestingly is ok too, bc in Switzerland that is not passive agressive, unless you deliberately make it so with your tone
Wie wäre es mit "da hast du nicht ganz unrecht"?
Swiss german is so insanely passive agressive
For example telling someone that he has made an intresting choice is often used as a harsh form of criticism
I don't think that meinetwegen is intrinsically negative, it depends on the context
See the synonyms in the [Duden] entry, some of them are negative, others neutral/positively assuring:
>einverstanden, es soll mir recht sein, gut, ich habe nichts dagegen/keine Einwände, in Ordnung, ja, nun gut/schön, ruhig, wenn es denn sein muss, wie du meinst/willst; (umgangssprachlich) in Gottes Namen, okay, von mir aus, wegen mir; (umgangssprachlich abwertend) soll er/sie doch; (veraltend) meinethalben
Yes
Didn't think of that but that fits pretty well
Hahah:D true
But I think „huh, that‘s an interesting choice you made there“ in the right tone probably has the same effect in English
Belgium can't take responsibility as a country because
well you know
I had several corrective eye surgeries when I was younger, so I assume I would be a blind beggar or something similar
Well
Napoleon and Switzerland for sure
Then of course the beginning of the oldest neutrality
Probably being a lot fitter than what I am now or dead
Would be to poor to use my smarts if I did actually live
Also it would be interesting on how things developed as my father was German, my mother Swiss
huh
100% agree
Taiwan is such an awesome and cute little country and they deserve the full support of the US and every European country
Nikolaus (Samichlaus) who comes on December 6th with his donkey and his helper Schmutzli lives in the black forest
Here a picture :)
It depends on the canton though (like everything in this country lol) I can only speak for the north-western part
Additional thing I just remembered: when the sky gets all read when tge sun sets in December/late November we say its because st nik is baking christmas cookies in the black forest
Cut off date for letters is December 14th
He just read leviticus a little *too* thuroughly
Gotta love that dog in the Fondue (there is after all "fondue chinoise" as well)
And even funnier they are mostly in the US
For a country that takes so much pride in having 3+ National languages, majority of tech and online services are exclusively Swiss German
It's pathetic really
I.e - Netflix only offering German subtitles etc
> I think large parts of the US military also still use Windows XP on their ships and subs
You'd think if any entity has the resources to pull off having an entire custom UNIX-style OS specifically tailored for them made, it'd be the US military
>For a country that takes so much pride in having 3+ National languages, majority of tech and online services are exclusively Swiss German
It's pathetic really
Yeah it's a pain in the ass when 80% of websites have German only
>Netflix only offering German subtitles etc
It what now
Never encountered this problem and I live in Geneva too
Consume mostly in English
I live in Lausanne and Netflix definitely has subtitles in french, as well as italian
What is happening I believe is that Netflix doesn’t have the same shows in every country
In Switzerland we actually benefit from the shows of the german, french and italian Netflix catalogues
If you can’t find subtitles in french for a specific show, it’s most likely because the french Netflix doesn’t have the rights to it, or that it isn’t extended to Switzerland
Except the annoying lack of Amazon
ch (that redirects you to Amazon
de) I’ve never had much issues with websites only in german in Switzerland
> majority online services are exclusively Swiss German
could you name some examples
Good
Carnotzet
A room, usually in the cellar, where you set up a table and benches / chairs, stock your wine and drink with friends
In the swiss german region of Bern there is the word „Äuä“, depending on the used context and pronunciation it can mean many things,
including but not complete : Yes, No, No way, Indeed, that’s a lie, that’s not a lie, can‘t believe it, believe it, „?“ , „!“ ..
and a lot more
Note that swiss german dialects are only spoken, not written, there are no grammatical rules
[the itis]
Yeah I know the struggle from translating Ancient Greek
It wasn't that frustrating because we translated the texts to German and not English, so we didn't have to use entire phrases as translation as we had conjunctions that somewhat fit but were still unsatisfying
But this isn't a new problem, it already was an issue when translating the New Testament from Greek to Latin nearly 2000 years ago, which is one of the reasons why this translation (and subsequently all modern translations based on this) is kinda terrible
In the Canton of Fribourg, school teach Catholicism from 6 yo to around 15 yo, so the whole obligatory school
If you are from another religion, your parents must sign some papers saying you won't follow the course
Afterwards, if you continue school (I did college), you have "religion sciences" for one year, where you talk in a more scientific and unbiased way about all the religions
Then you can choose if you want to have this course or not
yes, but it's been voluntary so far
they are planning on expanding the education on religion at the cost of geography which I find a rather bad idea, because geography is a much broader subject
If you are rude/accidentally touch or hit/ or spill beer in Germany to a man drinking beer, it's customary to challenge each other to a fistfight
After WW2, it became a custom to kneel before synagogues
May be more realistic with historical events idk
Never waste any beer, ever, or the bartender has the right to make you pay double
Since these are stereotypical, your friend might be more likely to believe it   ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
Tell him that in the Netherlands it is customary to bow to women in public
Tell him in Germany it isn't unusual for a man at a neighboring urinal to offer to shake your penis after urinating
I've never actually had an American dollar bill so this isn't too far off
I'd love to see and hold one someday when I go to 'Murica
>Tell him that in Italy, one must ask for ketchup on a pizza
We should really stick to things that don't get OPs friend killed
I must say, I was actually surprised when I first got my hands on a couple of them - didn't think there would be that much of a difference, it's just paper money after all
But many dollar bills are *very* worn
While ours are mostly pristine and very "stiff", dollar bills feel much more "clothy" in texture
Some of them have the structural integrity of a wet rag
And they smell terrible :)
*(No offense Americans, these were just the things that stood out to me)
Lol
I mean, I expected at least one case though
After all, it Germany ;D
Actually, I've heard several Americans say that they feel that Swiss people, and Germans as well, tend to stare
So there seems to be at least a subtle difference in what's considered a comfortable amount of eye contact
*Edit: Yep, apparently that really is a thing:* [*About the Swiss Stare*] *|* [*German Stare*]
Apparently we've won multiple awards for the prettiest bank notes
The more you know
Yeah but you would probably want to go for cheaper bank notes (because in some countries like 1000 equals 1 chf, so use that to your advantage) then you can make it rain for less
lifehacks
Yep I've heard of this too
Wasn't it developed during WWII because everyone was suspicious
Idk where I read that
>Plus it's such a chore to wash the money
Tell me about it
Yeah, I feel the same
Sure, most of it was probably in good fun, but sometimes these pile-ons on reddit can get a bit out of hand, where everyone just tries to outwit each other, on the expense of someone else
I have to agree
I don't dislike her or anything, but she can be a bit much
It's all so over the top
But the subject matter sometimes is still interesting, so I occasionally watch her
And it was the only source I could find for the Germans ;-)
If you want to see some of the other most beautiful bank notes
Meh, I would've laughed my ass off when I made that post
It's all just sarcasm at the end
Being a dick =!= being sarcastic
I wouldn't even have had to know to realize they're joking
That sounds
complicated
Yeah, but the color scheme is a bit all over the place while the Swiss one is all green
Maybe that why they picked the Swiss one to be most beautiful
Idk beauty is in the eye of the beholder
despite it not officially being the capital (we don't have one), Bern is probably still the best choice
very central when you look at the 4 language groups
if it were further east, the romandie would probably be a bit discontent with it
That would maximize Brno vs
Bern confusion
I had to learn in primary school that the capital city is Bern
Later moving to Bern and learning it's NOT the capital de jure, despite being headquarter of legislative and executive
Sometimes we go a bit far with federalism
For me it's the capital
If I had to move the Capital I would chose Zurich for being so central and important
But it would cause lots of problems
How about Fribourg ? A truly bilingual city
I'd put in Brüssel to trigger the UDC/SVP
I'm from Zurich countryside and I don't think it would be a good capital
I think everyone in Switzerland except zurichers would be upset about it lol
If Zurich became the capital, I hope Geneva became once again an independent Republic
Honestly - considering how decentralized our executive and judicative branch is - i think it's fair to keep the legislative branch in Berne
But if it needed to change, i guess Zurich, Basel or Geneva are the only 'modern' options, considering those are the only places with actual intl
airports
On the other hand, considering that you can be pretty much anywhere north of the alps within 1 hour from an intl
Airport it might not be relevant at all, and then it would simply be a quastion about regional politics - and i def
would not want to open that pandoras Box
Maybe Basel
Still pretty important
Switzerland is the EU’s fourth biggest trading partner behind the US, China and the UK (it used to be third before brexit)
It’s a pretty big deal for such a small country, and since we’re surrounded by EU members (except for our little Liechtenstein) we have a close relationship with its citizens
Many come to work or live in Switzerland, so the EU has been quite concerned about those aspects, hence why they agreed to sign the Bilateral Treaties
Yes
More seriously, we got lots of money and the EU needs that money
So we have agreements to exchange money
We're here to make everything that the EU does a little bit more complicated, as we are literally in the middle of the EU but won't join
Huh, I didn't know this about the Netherlands
It sounds very similar to what we have in Switzerland
The only exception is that almost all of our hospitals are publicly owned, which is something that I'm personally very glad about
I should say though that healthcare is a pretty important political topic in Switzerland too, and has been so for at least the past 20 years
Mostly because our insurance fees (premiums) are very expensive and they continue to rise
The left would like to change to a single-payer system or, at the very least, introduce more subsidies for low-income people
The right rejects all of these proposals because they believe the market should be as free as possible
So it's a very controversial topic
We had a national vote 10-15 years ago where we could've changed to a single-payer system but the popular initiative did not receive the necessary 50
01%-majority
I completely disagree
The nicest personnel over here are in the public University hospital
I don't like Doctors from private cabinets
In Spain too, the doctors and nurses are amazingly kind
Then you've never had any serious health problems
I have gone through some very, very serious health problems and I can guarantee you that a kind, friendly doctor makes a gigantic difference in a situation like
Sometimes it's worth sooo much to have a doctor sit there with you for a few minutes and tell you in a calming voice that things are going to be alright - *especially* if there's nothing anyone can do to help you at that moment
If you're the kind of guy who never cries but you're so deep in troubles (medically speaking) that you just want to ball your eyes out and give up on life, the very last thing you need is for your doctor to act like a total asshole
But Germany has a public option, doesn't it
I was not disagreeing with his own experience, obviously
I disagree from my own experience
Romanian sounds like a Slavic person mocking an Italian accent
Its still beautiful
catalan, it's not that it doesn't make sence, but for me it's spanish and french mixed, but you pronounce everything like a russian
Polish
It looks like they just take a bunch of consonants and put some accents on it
And when someones talk Polish, it's even weirder as Swiss German (that means a lot)
I wouldn't get even one word
I‘m sure here it differs as well but my experience was:
grade: school starts at 8:15 then there are two 45minute lessons until the big break (20-30minutes) then two more lessons until 11:45
in the afternoon school was from 13:30 to 15:00 three times a week
The other two times we didn‘t have school
to 6
grade: school starts at 7:30 (although i think we had one day in second grade that started at 8:15 still) the rest is the same as in first grade
Although sarting in ~4
or 5
grade some afternoons were until 16:15
In 7
to 9
grade the mornings were still from 7:30 to 11:45 with the big break after three lessons
The afternoons differed a lot because students could choose their own afternoon lessons
Many picked them so the would still have one or two afternoons off
Edit: there was also cooking school once a week in grade 8 and 9
Then students would eat at school and have the afternoon off after cleaning up and stuff
I think they get off at around 13:30
In highschool (kanti) because most students had to commute, the lessons started later
For me they started at 8:05
A lesson still was 45 minutes but we got 10 or 5 minute breaks between the lessons to switch rooms (the breaks weren’t the same in the morning and afternoon)
I usually had classes every afternoon
Some days until ~4or5 and some days only until ~3
It differed a lot from semester to semester
In one semester we had an afternoon off but two days of lessons until ~6
and only one until ~3
Oh and we ate lunch at home up until highschool
There we ate at the mensa or went to a supermarket to eat
Last school I went to wsd like that: start at 8:15, school hours were 45 minutes, no pause between them
Recess at 9:45 until 10:05
Lunch break at 11:40 and we start again at 12:40
Afternoon recess at 15:05 until 15:30
End of the day was either 16:05 or 16:50 depending of the day of the week
Cesaro is the most Swiss person
Lucerne
we often joke about how there are more tourists/east Asians in lucerne than there are Swiss people
apart from that, Lauterbrunnen and zermatt are also rather touristy
Zermatt has the Matterhorn, which is pretty much the signature Swiss mountain (the one depicted on Toblerone chocolate) and Lauterbrunnen is a yosemite-like valley that's got several amazing waterfalls and every second post about Switzerland you see is a picture of Lauterbrunnen
I’m not from Ireland, but I would have guessed cliffs of moher and the western coast in general
I know them all, I couldn't recite them on the fly but if I heard the name of one I would recognize it
Most people know half or more than half I would think
The names of the states and also most of the capitals are certainly known
However, most people probably do not know the exact location of all of them
Yeah
probably not 'most' but 'some'.
Komm, wir essen, Oma
Komm, wir essen Oma
The first one has the stress on the first syllable, the second one on the second syllable
It's only a problem in the infinitive form because they also conjugate differently
For 1st person singular that gives you "Ich fahre eine Person um" or "Ich umfahre eine Person".
I had to learn german in school for 10 years why did none of my teachers mention there are stress in german ?
Romandie
Yes
Swedish
I tried, I failed :D
Try Swiss German after German
To start probably the one from Zurich it's as far as I know the nearest to normal German
We aren't in the EU and I don't know how to feel about it
Hey, see the positives
Now you sit in the same boat as Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Norway
I bet it’s not that easy to shoot someone   you’ve never met, who hasn’t harmed you personally, especially if you make eye contact first
There is a [Swiss German (ie
Alemannic) Wikipedia] but it's relatively small (~27'700 Articles)
I only use it very very rarely (sometimes for regional stuff)
I primarily use the English Wikipedia, occasionally the German one
Isn't the Alemannic wiki just a translation of the German one
I don't think so
But except for some hyper-local topics it's probably more of a language conservation effort than an encyclopedia
Yes
Anywhere in EU/EFTA
Just say no to single use plastic
In Switzerland you can also safely drink water from city fountains unless they are clearly marked "kein Trinkwasser".
For sparkling water – a soda machine is a magical device and allows you to enjoy spiky water without wasting plastic
Here, yes absolutely (and the taste changes a bit depending on where you are because of the ground composition differences), but I have a friend studying in Paris, and when she dared to drink tap water (that tasted like chlorine apparently), everyone said she was mad for even trying it haha
In my region of Switzerland, my tap water is **literally** Evian
For me German tap water tastes like pool water, in Germany I definitely prefer bottled water
Out of curiosity, which ones
I drank tap water in many places in Poland and it was always fine
I find it reassuring that they don't ship water across the ocean
At the place I work I'm supposed to charge 2 francs per person for tapwater, but usually I don't or I just charge one head for the whole table
I do charge them full price if they are annoying or rude, or if I get the typical tourist couple that only wants tap water and shares one (1) small starter
I get it, Switzerland is expensive, but go to the damn supermarket if you're that stingy
Same in Switzerland
I was so confused initially, because in Poland, where I am from originally, blue bottle means sparkling, green means still
Anyway, still water comes from tap, sparkling comes from tap via a soda machine
Just say no to plastic
Have to admit that I was always in bigger cities (like Hamburg) when I visited Germany, that could be why it always tasted so bad
S.America -> U.S -> Switzerland
What turned out not to be true for Europe (in general)
* I'm shocked to find out how low the average salaries are outside of Switzerland
London salaries being the one that really blew my mind
* Speaking of England
I don't know where this stereotype about British food came from, but I have incredible meals whenever I go to England
For whatever reason I find pub food to be really top notch relative to "bar" food everywhere else in the world (Exceptions being S. Korea and Spain) - but those two probably has to do with there being a drinking culture that is intertwined with food
* The French, and Parisians in general, are not as rude as everyone makes it out to be
But maybe my experiences are different since I speak French
* Coming from S. America, and having been a huge football fan my whole life I must say I've been pretty surprised to find that majority of Europeans are not obsessed about football (Compared to my expectations)
Like I would say 98% of European women I meet have no interest in the sport, and put the number at around 60% for men
Thought it'd be a lot higher
Understood
But I'm comparing salaries in major European cities relative to the cost of living for said city
Let's say London salaries to (say) New York City salaries
My company has offices in both and for the same position, the salary in NYC is on average 60K USD v 35K GBP (45K USD)
From people that have lived in both cities, they claim the cost of living is quite similar
We have the same issue down here in Switzerland, the plains are warm, temperatures last week rose to 10°C. In the Alps it’s not much better, there’s snow but not nearly as much as usual
Went biking around Lake Geneva at lunchtime yesterday, it was sunny and warm, real spring vibes
Bydgoszcz was the first one although I would have known it by its German name Bromberg so the 100% first one is the one below Plovdiv
Others afterwards are Timișoara and Craiova
You need to know french, german and a little bit of italian and english
And then you need to live in switzerland for 15 years or so
Then you can maybe speak a bit, but you will clearly understand the language at this point
Don't be intimidated by the long words in German
You can understand them once you get the concept of a compound word
German has three definite definite articles (Die, Der, Das)
They all mean the English definite article "the". They also have no rule deciding where they should be placed
The syntax for German is SOV (Subject+Object+Verb) as compared to the English syntax of SVO (Subject+Verb+Object)
You can also understand half the language if you can speak English
These are tips for Standard German not Swiss German (my native language) and Alemannic (also my native language)
Those languages/dialects are demons and cans of worms I don't wanna open
French grammar and spelling conventions are similar to English
They have the same syntax of SVO (Subject+Verb+Object)
Like German, you can understand like 75% of the language if you know English
Sorry, I don't have any more tips for French, as I am learning French in school
I don't speak Italian
I will take it in College
There is none, you habe to do it the hard way
This is for swiss german
aaaand then you learn about genitiv and "Ich befinde mich in der Stadt
It's too late for me, my German is already awful
So at this point I just decided that if I don't remember the gender of a word, even if I get it wrong people will understand
Plus in Swiss German you can avoid genders almost entirely thank to the usage of "d' " to replace der/die/das
I don't know if it's just in my dialect or if I'm wrong, but when I think about it, I always use "de" for male "d' " for female and "s' " or " ds" for neutral
swiss german
oh shit that’s embarrassing lol i was thinking about whether it was akkusativ or dativ and somehow ended up with genitiv
We already have trouble figuring out what makes all of us Swiss
Hey, fuck that
Yeah, good luck with that
No offense, but to me that just sounds like another shade of "am deutschen wesen soll die welt genesen".
Yeah but fuck aristocracy too while we‘re at it
It was never important here as in „Swiss aristocracy“, we‘ve never really had that
It was always foreign folks, like the Habsburger from Austria
Fair enough
If you eat with your elbows and forearms on the table : "is your dad an aviator
If your fly is open :  "your shop is open"
If you’re being annoying and they tell you off : "go cook yourself an egg"
Same here

Here in Switzerland we have to pay around CHF 350
- for watching Tv listening to Radio or others newsmedia
You have to pay for only by owning a TV, Radio, Radio in Car or a phone, even if you don't use any of it for this
I hate this so much, I don't use any of it
"It doesn't matter, you might use it one day
Man that really makes me wonder what is going on in your forrests
If I'm right, you need a good reason to do this and you have to kill it without having it to suffer
Well Swiss German does not have an official orthography so you "write like you hear it".
The shitter (d‘Schissi)
The place where even the Pope goes alone
Not what I use in everyday life but rather jokingly
We just have such a poetic language
Beautiful
I was going to say s Hüsli (the little house) but this seems more valid
"quiet placelet"
The 'classic' answer is *'Chuchichäschtli'*, the hard 'ch' found in Swiss-German are hard to pronounce for most foreigners
I also like '*Grüazi'/'Grüezi*' especially with Germans because they struggle real hard with the diphthong 'üa'/'üe', usually they pronounce either only the 'ü' or they pronounce it 'ü-a' as two distinct vowels
Edit: I found [this] video of some dude pronouncing Chuchichäschtli, and specifically the 'CH' sound
"Trois arbre". For people who aren't used to the French R sound, it's not super easy
Gopfridstutz also leads to very entertaining results
And as a translation, Chuchichäschtli means kitchen cupboard
Grüezi is used as a greeting, usually with people you don't rrally know like a cashier, people just walking by and so on
TIL it has a tli at the end
I can say it but it's not like I see much written Swiss German here in Basel
Gopferdammi, I forgot about that one xD
"G"s yes, but I'm pretty sure our "ch"s are harder than the Dutch ones
Can't say Gopferdammi without the nundedie :D
Well, thah's my TIL for today xD
I added a youtube link to the original comment so you can listen to the Swiss pronunciation of 'ch'
We have a kind of weird thing, that causes a  ton of confusion with non-Swiss German speakers:
We call our friends Kolleg/Kollegä (colleague/s)
This is used as „friend“ or „Freund“ in German is used
The word „Fründ“/„Fründin“ (Freund/Freundin, friend) is exclusively used for romatinc relationships
It‘s used as a synonym for boyfriend/girlfriend
If you say „Er isch min Fründ“ (He‘s my friend), what you‘re really saying is „He‘s my boyfriend“. If you say „Er isch min Kolleg“, you‘re saying „He‘s my friend
This is specific for Switzerland, and causes a ton of confusion bc most Swiss people dont get that if you say „Er ist mein Kollege“ to a German you are actually calling him your colleague and not your friend
Some Swiss people also mistranslate colleague to mean friend in English bc of that
Other than „Kolleg“, we use mostly the same names the Germans do:
Junge/Jungs (boy(s)), Brudi/Bruder (brother), dude, bro
Some dialects have some fun names, bernese has the wonderful „Giele“ (Boys) (and „Meitschi“ (Girls), but I‘ve never personally heard Meitschi used for anyone older than 12 or so)
I’ve been to berlin for new years before and it’s crazy
The fireworks just do NOT stop from 8am the 31st til 8am the 2nd
You’re lucky if you get 10 seconds of silence in those two days
Germans LOVE their fireworks
(Or just really like new year’s)
That fact isn’t that fun, tbh
Nah, it's Rivella
In Switzerland the smallest coin we have is the 5ct and it’s still pretty hated
Weird thing is, some shops such as Aldi still put prices with .89 or .99, and they round up to the closest multiple of 5 (below) in the final bill
It allows them to make a few more cents
What are the boy scouts like in your country
TL;DR: What are boy scouts like in your country
I was a boy scout for about 5 years and really enjoyed my time there
I've got lots of fond memories from that time
First I was a member of the "Wölfli" ("little wolves"), which is basically the junior section of the Swiss boy scouts
I made a lot of good friends there
Around age 11, I was "promoted" to the real boy scouts
When I was 18, I went on a high school exchange year to the US
During that time, I learned how incredibly different Swiss and American boy scouts are
I would've never guessed
One of the most stunning differences was the general atmosphere
In Switzerland, being a boy scout is first and foremost meant to be fun
We did learn some handy skills (how to make a fire etc
) but most of our time was spent playing games and goofing around
Our leaders frequently came up with tasks and challenges loosely resembling a computer strategy game
For example we'd have to roam through the forest in small groups and find certain things, complete tasks, solve riddles etc
The whole thing was never meant to be uber-schoolmasterly though; sometimes a few boys would also just give up in the middle of the afternoon and go back to the central meeting place (usually an open meadow) to hang out
Our leaders would encourage us to continue but they didn't force anything on us
By comparison, boy scouts as I saw it in America was incredibly
uptight, for lack of a better word
The main intention seemed to be to lecture boys about the importance of community work
It felt much more like military service but without weapons
Everything was super strict and serious
My host brother was a boy scout and he'd do things like helping out in retirement homes or sitting in a room making packages to send them somewhere
American boy scouts didn't feel like a fun club a 12-year old would want to participate in but rather a school-like after-school activity that **parents** would want their boys to do in order to become better citizens or better christians or something like that
Here in Switzerland, we sometimes ran into boy scout groups from another municipality and we'd engage in completely pointless brawls
Our leaders thought that was hilarious (and so did we)
I don't think American boy scout leaders would ever allow that
Another shocking difference were the leaders themselves
Here in Switzerland, boy scout leaders are usually between 18-25
They can be both guys and girls
In fact, the leader-teams are usually mixed with about 2 guys and 2 girls
I loved all of my leaders; they were all awesome in their own way and they all had their unique personality
In America, most boy scout leaders seem to be middle-aged men
In fact, my host dad was a boy scout leader and he was nearly 60
I still think that's super weird
In Switzerland, leaders are something like older siblings
They're authority figures but they're also your friends
There was one leader-girl who all of us boys entrusted with our love problems because she was so sweet
As a 12-year old American kid, I would've never wanted to tell some 50-year old dude about my elementary school crush
It would have felt super uncomfortable
The fact that boy scout leaders in the US are so old made the uptight, philistine, school-like atmosphere even stronger
Another big difference was that American boy scouts seem to spend most of their time indoors, which really surprised me
Swiss boy scouts spend almost all of their time outdoors, usually in the nature
Finally, another interesting difference was that American boy scouts don't have special names
In Switzerland, every boy scout has his/her special boy scout name
In fact, there's a whole ritual that you have to go through in order to receive that name
It usually includes "surviving" a very scary scenario, such as having to walk through the forest alone at night and getting "abducted" by your leaders dressed as monsters or zombies etc
It's meant to resemble an interactive, real-life nightmare that is scary but also exciting at the same time
At the end of it, you receive your nickname by which you will thenceforth be addressed and most boys are very proud of their boy scout name
In the US, all the kids were simply addressed by their regular names and when I told my host dad about those rituals where kids have to walk through the forest at night, he just stared at me like I had lost my mind
having said all of this, what are the boy scouts like in your country
Do they resemble the ones in Switzerland or are they more like the ones in the US
Or something entirely different
Have you ever been a boy scout
And if so, did you have a nickname
What was it
Thanks for sharing :-)
Apologies for the long post
Edit: Thank you so much for all of your replies
I really enjoyed reading about all the different perspectives
One important correction: scouts in Switzerland are in fact also mixed (boys and girls together)
I must've phrased this badly
I was on a year long exchange in Tokyo (Japan), and I noticed how their scouts (i didn't join them) do a lot p it side too, despite living in a huge city and only having the numerous parks availible
similarly to Switzerland, they also do camps, which take place somewhere outside in a usually more rural area, though
Well obviously it‘s very similar to yours, but we have mixed groups
Only very few scout groups in my canton have gender split activities, but even those have a mixed summer camp
We try to get away from the military-theme, e.g. our saturday meetups are no longer called „üebig“ (lit
exercise), but „aktivität“ or „alass“ (lit
activity or event“)
Also my group is the only one in the entire canton that isn‘t attached to a church, thats also why we are one of the poorest
This is very interesting
I didn't know the Dutch scouts were banned by the nazis
Nowadays that can basically be viewed as a badge of honor ;-)
Thank you for your reply
Thanks for your reply
This is a great point that I left out to avoid making my post even longer
We also have a couple of different scouting organizations
For example the main one that I was a member of is technically protestant, while another big one is catholic
These are just labels based on tradition though
In real life, religion never plays a big role (at least it didn't in my troop)
There are also some organizations that are more adjusted for the interests of girls
Swiss boy scouts allow girls to join but you have to be a bit of a tomboy to be cool with all the rowdy, hyperactive boys
My little sister was first a member of the regular boy scouts but then it became too much for her, so she changed to an all-girls organization that focused on more calm activities that the average girl would be into
I'm very sorry you made such bad experiences
I can totally imagine it though
Not all scout troops and leaders are cool
A few years after I left (school was getting too demanding), I read in the newspaper that a scouting troop from a neighboring town had become the center of a scandal because several of the leaders turned out to be neonazis
They had been trying to indoctrinate the kids for years
I was of course pretty shocked by that
My leaders had all been such wonderful and caring people
Looking back, I must say they were also super mature for their age
I was reading your post and waited for the gender bit (because a couple days ago I just read a post on how gendered american scouts are and that that's not the case in Europe) we seemed to have grown up in different parts of Switzerland
I (a woman)  am swiss and also joined the Scouts (no one even calls the scouts boy/girl here) and it was never a question of gender (in fact I think it was incredibly ungendered) and you certainly didn't have to be a tomboy to like it, I certainly wasn't and I loved it
My guess is that we grew up in different parts in Switzerland (we also learned a lot of technical/survival things)
I think our group was very even (gender wise) and everybody loved it
But yeah, most of it has to do with goofing around, playing the part the leaders meant (they always put on some kind of storyline for the day and kinda role played it out) but it was always a lot of fun
&#x200B;
For a minute there I was thinking that you were talking about the Jungschii/Blauring thing
Oh, for sure
I didn't mean to promote traditionalist gender stereotypes
All I can say is that, in order to "survive" in our troop, you had to be a certain type of girl
I always had a lot of respect for our girl members because I'm more of a soft/calm guy myself and some of the boys in our troop were a royal pain in the ass
The reason it worked out for me was because I was the oldest kid for a very long time, so even the particularly mischievous boys respected me a bit more than everyone else (I kind of assumed the unofficial role of an assistant leader at one point)
The girls didn't have this advantage though and they really had to put up with a lot of annoying stuff at times
Looking back, our leaders probably should've been a little stricter with those boys
I think the reason they weren't is because they felt like it's healthiest for those kind of boys to act out a bit
like letting your dog run around outside for a couple of hours
To be clear, I think it's wonderful your troop was so evenly mixed
I love the idea of gender being irrelevant in the scouts
Maybe it's also a matter of age
I'm in my 30s... if you're 10 years younger than me, this may in fact have made a difference
Our society's attitude towards these issues made quite a leap from the 90s to the 2000s (at least that was my impression)
I can't say that gender was irrelevant in my troop
Like I said, we didn't have too many girls
Still though, in comparison to the US where girls weren't even allowed until recently I'd say it was very relaxed
And yes, I was in fact referring to Blauring ;-)
That's the organization my little sister joined after she left the scouts
I don't know too much about Blauring but I've heard from my sister and my mom that they're more "girls-oriented" in terms of activities and general atmosphere
This is really interesting
Makes me wonder if it's more of a "Germanic culture" (UK, central Europe, Scandinavia) type of thing
Yeah, I also find that a bit sad to be honest haha
there are a few, but they're definitely not common
My hometown is named after a former roman settlement/mansion
There aren't really ruins left but you can still kinda make out where it used to be (just farm land now though)
And many people find roman coins and stuff buried in the woods
Not common, but pretty cool
[Augusta Raurica] is just 10 kilometers from Basel, on the Rhine
There are extensive ruins there, including a (rebuilt) amphitheater that hosts concerts throughout the summer
Yea, he was a legend here too when I was a teen
That Migros Ice Tea is the best iced tea
Still some debate on whether lemon flavored is better than peach
I'd say everybody in my country EXCEPT people from Zurich will agree that Zurich sucks
LEMON all the way
But yeah, Migros Ice Tea is infamous
I think we can also agree on the fact that our swiss chocolate is far superior to any other chocolate there is
Lemon is the superior flavor and I'm ready to fight anyone on that
Peach flavor is obviously the best, it shouldn’t even be a debate
>cheese
oh boi
Tell that to my brother in-law
Most of the time one of my neighbors accepts the package and it's in front of my flat when I come home, but that's inside the building, there's no possibility of anyone stealing it
If they can't even find a neighbor to accept it, there's a little note that says you can pick it up at the post office or go online to (re)schedule delivery
Well, if we get a package, we usually either receive it while we're home or they bring it to a postal locker at our local village store, so it doesn't just stand around outside
Here, the parcel carriers put the parcels in front of the house door or in the back garden
So far none has been stolen
Yep - for the Swiss postal service
They're doing an excellent job lately, their digital services are really well done, and they strike a good balance between common sense pragmatism and still following proper procedure
For the international parcel companies like UPS or DHL it's a different story
My experiences range from decent to outright terrible
UPS is the only consistent one though - consistently bad
I try to avoid them whenever I can when ordering abroad (which is quite often)
DHL and DPD are a mixed bag it seems (depending on the driver), and FedEx I've had mostly positive experiences with
Yeah, we now have 'contactless delivery' too, but that usually means that they'll ring a doorbell and one of the neighbors (or me) will press the button to open the door into the building such that they can deposit the package inside the building
That way it's protected from the elements and only people with a key to the building (aka
Neighbors) can access it
There are expressions that are spelled exactly the same but are pronounced/emphasized differently
E.g. "öppis Umfahre" vs
"öppis umfAhre". The first means to run over something and the second means you drive around it
(Also works in German German)
I wonder why kjedelig means boring then
In Swiss Standard German (i.e. The Version of standard German that is taught in Schools here) there is no difference, but the difference is clear from context anyways
In Swiss German (which is the language we actually use everyday) the problem doesn't come up as both phrases don't really exist
I would say they do exist, however (atleast I) say im Mass for in moderation and in Massä for en masse
Ig suufe im Mass or Ig suufe in Massä.
Es trafen sich zwei Jäger im Wald
Beide tot
I thought about that, but it sound kinda contrived, in the sense that you'd only say that if you were translating the German expression
I don't think I'd ever use sucha construction when just talking
Going to visit other European countries
being in another country
Electronics
They are cheaper here than in most other european countries
Especially when you compare it to our high paychecks
I was just trying to think of something, good one
Yeah I was going to say nothing, but this is better
I haven’t been there, but according to [this site] Oslo is still cheaper than Zürich
I just googled it because i didnt know either
The article i read said it could be because theres a lot of competition between the sellers here in switzerland
Also it could be because they test how the items sells
I love them
Watching rain and hearing thunder is wonderful
No I don't. Just no
Rain outside while I'm in my bed is cozy but thunderstorms
just no
Kühlschrank (fridge) - Cooling cupboard
Scheinwerfer (spotlights) - beam thrower
Eigelb (yolk) - eggyellow
Faultier (sloth) - lazy animal
Stinktier (skunk) - stink animal
Flugzeug (plane) - fly thing
Feuerzeug (lighter) - fire thing
Spielzeug (toy) play thing
Fahrzeug (vehicle) drive thing
Edit: "Zeug" means "stuff" not "thing". While being very similar, it's not the same, sorry guys
Flugzüüg = Fly thing (plane)
Rägeschirm = Rain shield (umbrella)
Fernseher = Far-seer (TV)
Fahrzüüg = drive thing (vehicle)
Bratschufle = frying shovel (spatula)
Herdöpfel = Stove apple (potato)
those are some of the good ones I could think of atm
Also the german term for Computer is „Rechner“ which translates to calculator
I love the -thing words, way too many to list here haha
Also:
Dickhäuter (pachyderm) - Thick-skinner / Thick-hider (the word is much more common than "pachyderm" in English)
your sentence would be very similar to the german one so i‘ll make one myself
Ich rede Mundart

I'm unsure if we have bears, but if we don't have them, it would be wolves I think
I get you, It’s faster to cross Jestetten :D
wait til you see how Switzerland works
we have a council of 7 people who act as the executive, while there's also a council president who's mainly just a figurehead and doesn't have any more say
You might see a Europe flag here on the 5th for the Council or Europe day, but a flag on the 9th would be unlikely
Even on the 5th it would be at official government buildings and not something the average person would have
I recall seeing the Europe flag flying for all of May on some government buildings in the past, but I do not see that all the time and it might have been for some diplomatic thing
Sennentuntschi if you find it anywhere with subtitles
Watch ‚das weisse Rauschen‘ for Germany if you‘ve watched Goodbye Lenin
I don’t know, because our head of government has 7 heads and i‘d happily replace some of them but not the whole council
Switzerland’s is a great deal, you get 7 for 1
Same
I never really got that "we like Merkel" vibe from you guys up north
Changes yearly, has no real meaning
Technically it's the President of The Federal Council, so just the figurehead representing the aforementioned 7
Switzerland doesn't technically have a national president, even though everyone just says The Swiss President because it's simpler
And yeah, the council elects a new one every year and it grants no additional power, so
Well not elect, they more or less rotate in the order of years served in the council
Sure
I meant they agree amongst themselves, what the actual decision making process is, I admit I don't know, so I'll take your wordon this :)
I live by the contested idea that Swiss German is its own language and not a German dialect
I think Swiss German itself is oddly cute sounding
it uses loads of diminutives and also has some great, hilarious "made up" words like "schubladisieren" which literally means drawer-ise and means to put something off indefinitely
Probably that we understand the Germans but the Germans don't understand us
It‘s so diverse that even some people who also speak swiss german e.g. people from valais and people from thurgau have trouble understanding each other
We mock each others dialects all the time
I think it‘s really nice that no ther country (except the amish) speak swiss german
I couldn‘t think of going into a different country and speaking my native language
It‘s kind of weird, because technically it is german, but germans don‘t understand us, but we understand them
I think I've never seen someone compliment swiss-german, thanks
For me „schubladisieren“ means to judge people based on stereotypes
Everyone gets put in a akready existing drawer
It‘s lije box thinking
It does sound v cute
I really like the rhythm of the language, and that ‘singsong-y’ way of saying things
>we mock each others dialects all the time
AUÄÄÄ
Some people (who speak romance languages) have told me that it can also sound very rough with our "ch" sounds
guät, ich ha halt au ä zürischnurrä...
Yeah it's certainly possible but most Germans I personally know that aren't around Swiss people often have real trouble understanding a normal casual conversation
And then there's some swiss dialects like that from the Wallis or Graubünden that I myself have trouble understanding
But I would also have trouble with some German Dialects like Bayerisch for example
Sichoo nööd
For me Bavarian is more related to Austrian German actually, I think for Swiss German (in general but also especially where I live) the French influence plays an important role as well for words like "Trottoir, Portemonnaie, Velo (sometimes even Bicyclette), Parapluie
" Don't really think that there's much of a connection to Bavarian other than them both sounding weird to others though
Trying to read dutch (or flemish in your case) is always fun, it's like deciphering a text from a very drunk friend
Yoo I didn't know you say "Hoi" too, Swiss-Dutch alliance
Me neither I think, maybe it's used in some German dialects but in Swiss-German it's the most widely used form of "Hi" across the dialects
You learn new things every day
Fuck our effectiveness in war, our alliance would have the greatest chocolate, fries, cheese, beer and weed; sounds fun
Oh that would be nice but I personally don't understand you guys at all, I can read dutch reasonably well but when it's spoken it's a different story
I personally also never heard other Swiss people say that, but maybe it's those who have a more severe dialect themselves
Of course, you're probably getting accidentally invaded by us as we speak anyways
Woah okay, sounds like I need to listen to some dutch and see if I can get the hang of it
To people who don‘t like cheese: Fondue
And also in Valais (southern switzerland), they eat the balls of the bulls
(Stierhöde)
Fruit pudding is also delish  (Scotland speaking)
It's super common
I would even say that it has become a standard word in German
In my my canton, which both is French and German speaking I feel like both parts use it A LOT
I use it in both (Swiss) German and English in exactly the same way
I don't use it in French but I don't know how/if native speakers use it
I don't know if it's a me thing or if more people do it but I use it a lot with an "german" e at the end (oke)
Alternatively when I speak Spanish I change the e for an i.
C'est OK !!

There is a town of [Au] at Lake Zürich
There is a castle and some wine yards there
A very nice place to take a walk
I know of at least two places called Au: Au ZH and Au SG
There's also Bex which is about the same length in speaking because the x is silent
In the canton of Zurich, you will also find a (rather small) river called Aa
Hi neighbor, we also have an [Au]
There is also [Hel] It is not a "big" place by any measure, but contrary to Ełk everyone knows where Hel is
There is also Gy, in canton Geneva

**French:** Article about [Angelina Grün,] former German handball player
Understood pretty much all sentences at the beginning, only thing I had to look up was "[réceptionneuse-attaquante] I can understand about 60–70% without problems
**Spanish:** Article about [Burka] since my mother tongue is Portuguese, I didn't have much trouble understanding the first paragraphs
Just a few words that are written completely different than in Portuguese
50 – 60%.
**Italian:** Article about [Nikolaj Ivanov] although this is a very short article, I had to look up "canottiere" and "stato" so I didn't even know what the article was all about
Had a bit of trouble with this one
About 40%.
**Romanian:** Article about [Electrometru Lippmann] again, *very* short article (2 lines of text)
I was surprised how many words I kinda could understand
But not enough words to understand the context
40–50%.
**Catalan:** Article about [Fjaðrárgljúfur,] i don't know what «congost» means, other than that it's pretty similar to Spanish
Couldn't make out the second paragraph tho
About 50%.
Speaking French and Spanish (and learning Italian), it was quite easy to understand all of them except for Romanian, which was not impossible to understand, but required quite a bit of effort

Writing a passive aggressive letter to your neighbors about whatever issue it is you're having
This is considered proper and acceptable in Switzerland
Considering the alternative is simply calling the police at 22:01 PM and letting them get a noise violation summons
Or going straight to the building management where they will be warned and have a record against them
The rest of the world is more of a "feel free to knock on my door if anything is bothering you" type system
You know face to face discussion
Hahaha yes, extra points if its an anonymous "open letter" pinned somewhere in the entrance, either calling out the people in apartment xy or describing what "someone" is doing wrong and urging "them" to stop
>Writing a passive aggressive letter to your neighbors
These are explicitly forbidden in my building
By means of a passive aggressive note from management, plastered all over the laundry room
Oh god yes
Recently there was one in my laundry room
Someone had slipped into the *horrible* habit of leaving their laundry detergent and sometimes a basket of dirty laundry they want to wash in the laundry room *when it is not their designated laundry day* . Only took two weeks for a note to appear: „As per the house rules, tenants are not allowed to store personal property in the laundry room
The laundry room is only to be used by tenants on their designated laundry days
The fun part
Our laundry room is huge
Noone could possibly be bothered by a container of laundry detergent standing around
But oh well
I’m much cooler in french :D
That's a difficult one to answer, I don't even know really
I 'feel' different when speaking different languages though
I feel like there are two general modes:
Swiss German and English
This includes my 'school high German' which is just standard German with a Swiss accent
Standard German and French
This standard German is actual standard German I speak with non-Swiss native German speakers
This is the one I use less often and I feel like I open my eyes a bit more here and just 'light up' a bit
Weird, I know
Another weird thing is that in standard German and English I am what my former Latin teacher calls a 'dialect chameleon'. To some extent, I automatically adapt my accent to the person I'm talking to (which gets uncomfortable when talking to a non-native German speaker)
This results in people sometimes being confused when I tell them where I'm from after talking to them for a bit
This leads to a second slight issue: I don't really have my own accent when speaking English which means that if I have to start talking before I have a 'reference' I have to choose an accent
If I need to sound angry when speaking English, I sometimes use an aggressive Scottish accent because it's easier to sound angry then
And sometimes I use a Scottish accent just because I feel like using it and making life difficult for everyone
I'm quadrilingual, can I still answer
I change my behaviour depending on whom I'm talking to much more than depending on the language I use to speak to them
But I guess the same is true for monolinguals, so the actual answer to your question would be no
Probably not, Italians also shout quite a lot and speak quite aggressively sometimes
As soon as you cross the border everyone is so loud
The Italian speakers in Switzerland aren't though for some reason
From what I've heard, guide dogs are usually trained in Italian for those reasons
And because they don't want guide dogs to be limited to one area
We're indifferent about Bern
In Switzerland it's not the capital city that gets the hate because in theory we don't have a capital, Bern is usually just considered to be the capital
The hated place is the largest city, Zürich
They say we're arrogant but they're probably just jealous
I actually quite like it
Geneva as well for us french speakers
De jure we don't, but the facto it's Bern
But it is the capital de facto, everything else is just splitting hairs
it wasn't s controversy, it just is geographically, strategically, historically, politically and aesthetically the most sensible choice
They're not as nice as the rest of the French-speaking part of Switzerland
Same goes for the Lausanners
I guess you could say that in Switzerland‘s case, Zurich and Geneva kinda fulfil the role of capitals and that‘s why they are disliked
Bern is too insignificant to be hated
> Declaring Zürich as capital (de jure) would be interesting
Sure, if you like thermonuclear war
Jura Bernois or Neuchâtel, provided you speak French
I see you've been to eastern Switzerland, possibly Zürich
People there are not representative of the rest of us
We're a tiny country but mentalities and people's characters differ significantly if you go West only by 100km or so
Lol aargau, the nuclear wasteland DMZ between our glorious capital and the filthy cokehead banksters centre of Zürich
Many of us are total cunts
Avoid the east, it's worse there
It'll be harder to make friends, and make daily life harder in general
Don't count on everyone speaking English
Some won't even though they could
You might feel excluded somewhat
Imagine you come here, live here for a few months, have a job, blah blah blah, then one friday evening your coworkers invite you to a beer
Great, you think, they accept me
But when you get there, they'll speak French 99% of the time, and getting progressively more annoyed having to speak English with you as they get more drunk
It's nothing personal, but still you'll feel a bit excluded
Situations like that will happen again and again and will take their toll on your emotional well-being if not your mind
So, long story short
If you plan on living somewhere, doesn't matter where, learn the language
Italian: Bellinzona, Locarno/Ascona, Lugano
German: Fribourg, Berne
But honestly the French speaking Swiss are just nicer in general
Of course not, we're not barbarians
Our executive branch isnt even able to collapse, therefore basically never
Our executive branch consists of 7 people (Bundesräte)
We have the so called "Zauberformel" which basically makes sure that all the major parties have government responsibilities
The three biggest parties get 2 seats and the 4th biggest party gets 1, totalling 7
Therefore the opposition in Switzerland has historically been really small
If one of the 7 people fucks up bad, they tend to get replaced by another person of the same party
The only time that hasnt really happend was 2007 but that story would take too long to explain
Swiss politics is based on consensus - it's always about finding a solution that works for everyone so there are never ever any coalitions or oppositions that could fall apart
As far as I understand in a coalition principle the danger for the executive branch is that a coalition might fall apart and they'd loose the majority in parliament and thus the ability to do pretty much anything
That simply cannot happen in a consensus democracy
Edit: I remembered a story which illustrates Swiss politics like no other (Newsstories in German: [1] and [2] :
There was a political meeting, and everyone knew that they'd vote on some legislation that day
One of the politicians present (Christian Levrat - then president of the SP, Social Party, Left Socialists) mentioned that on that day his daughter was graduating from school, but unfortunately he couldn't be there for the occasion because the vote was so important
Another politician from a different party (Konrad Garber, CVP, Christians People Party, Conservatives) was appalled and told Levrat that that's unacceptable and that family should always cowe first
He was so appalled by the idea of someone misning their daughters graduation, that he offered to vote as Levrat would - even if this means voting against his own political views
The deal wan made and Garber promised to follow the vote of Roberto Zanetti (SP, as such a close friend of Levrat) in questions to faithfully replace Levrat
The problem was not quite solved yet though, as Levrat had lost his Car keys and would not make it in time
Federal Councilor Ueli Maurer (SVP, Swiss Peoples Party, right-wing conservatives, the polar opposite of Levrats' SP) stepped in and offered his car to Levrat for the day
According to all involved all promises were kept
(The car keys were later found and Maurer took Levrats car so they could meet up and swap cars back
It was first used in 1959 as an ironic description of the proposed 2-2-2-1 system by Switzerlands most important publication NZZ (Neue Zürcher Zeitung)
When the 2-2-2-1 was first introduced, the FDP (market liberals) would loose a seat as a result
The NZZ and the FDP are so closly connected that they are basically a party publication when it comes to politics
Therefore the NZZ attacked the supporters of the 2-2-2-1 system and ironically called it a magic formula since only in theory and with magic the 2-2-2-1 would be a good idea
Over the years it lost its negative connotation and basically became the official name of the 2-2-2-1 system
Because it magically holds our politics together
Edit: typo
For two reasons: First the greens had a massive boost  in the last election - it's new that they are that big
And secondly, and more importantly, because it's not about who has how many seats in parliament - it's about consensus
It's about forming a government that everyone can agree on
See the discussion between me and u/[stijinp] in this thread
Also: if the green manage to repeat their success in 2023 I fully expect that the distribution of seats will change - but probably not to give the greens a seat, but to give the green-libs (GLP) a seat - even if they are smaller than the greens - again: consensus not proportion is what matters
If you look at our last election (2019) of the first chamber (parliament) you can see that the greens just surpassed the christian demorcats for the first time in their history
The 2-2-2-1 formula isnt written into law which therefore doesnt give the green party an an obligatory seat
The parliament elects the seven Bundesräte, its not a direct election
If the green party confirms their result in 2023, their claim to a seat become a lot more substantial since the 2019 result can no longer be considered a fluke
Its more likely tough that the FDP or the SP need to give up one seat, which would make it a 2-2-1-1-1 formula
Also what is not mentioned is that the christian democrats are actually the biggest party in our senate(Ständerat) with i think 12 seats while the greens have 3 or 4 so, which means cvp(christian democrats) will not give up a seat soon
If the greens will get a seat it would logically come from the fdp since they have 2 and proportionally "should" only get 1
There are more fundamental differences between a Westminster-style coalition/opposition political system and the Swiss political system
In Switzerland, the 7 cabinet ministers are expected to publicly defend a single common position, even if it contradicts their own personal party's opinions
Furthermore, it's very common for the 4 parties represented in the government to vote against the work done by the government, and this isn't perceived as a threat to a governing coalition
Essentially, there is a clear line of demarcation between the legislative and executive roles in Switzerland, it's less about party tribalism
Ironically, the two parties that statistically support the proposals of the government the most are the GLP and the BDP - two smaller parties that don't have a seat on it
A vote of no confidence is also something that doesn't exist in Switzerland
The difference is that in Switzerland it's not 3-4 parties - it's every single party, even the smallest, most fringe party
There's never "Parties A, B and C are in charge now" it's always "Parliament, who as a whole is in charge, looks like this: Party A 24%, Party B 20% ...".
Even excluding a fringe party with one or two seats wouldn't work, because their supporters would just organize popular initiatives or referenda
This even happens with organizations that aren't parties, there's a huge sea of NGOs, NPOs, interest groups etc
that are included in the process of finding a consensus because literally anyone (even private citizens) can override anything parliament or the federal council does by initiative or referendum
Unless the GLP makes a huge jump next election, I personally really wouldn't expect them to gain a seat without a complete rework of the Zauberformel
If the Greens are the significantly bigger party, they'll get the "green seat" - the Greens (and the SP) electorate would otherwise riot if they get treated like that
However, I saw some journalists suggest that we might eventually end up with a new 2-1-1-1-1-1 Zauberformel: 2 for the SVP, and 1 for everybody else - FDP, CVP, SP, GLP and Greens
Well it'd be a very Swiss compromise
There's certainly good cause for a greener Federal Council, but the greens and the SP being as close as they are having two SP seats and a green seat wouldn't work
Prioritizing the GLP would represent green ideas without destroying the left-right balance
But I see that 2-6X1 would also solve the issue
>t's impossible to always have consensus on every topic
Not only is it possible, it's necessary
In Swiss politics absolutely nothing happens if there's no consensus on some sort of compromise on the matter
No one ever get's their way
And that's the secret sauce of a consensus democracy: compromise - you have to find a compromise that (nearly) everyone agrees with
There's really three things that can happen to any proposed legislation:
\- if you don't find a decent compromise your proposal will fail in parliament, (and that's the end of that - you could launch a popular initiative, but if your idea has failed in parliament the chances of it passing the public vote are very slim)
\-  if you do find a compromise that satisfies parliament but does not satisfy the general public it will likely fail in a popular referendum,
The **only way** to change anything is to make it such a good compromise that neither parliament nor the general public disagree
Pretty much so, yes
Even if we may suck at it, most of us had to learn at least two foreign languages in school, usually english and german/french/italian, sometimes spanish
But it’s a common enough skill that I think most people aren’t impressed if you’re bilingual
Define "foreign". I learned a total of 4 languages in basic school
Only one is considered foreign
That's the only one I can properly speak besides my mother tongue
I consider knowing 2 languages nothing special
I mean I can, and have, read books in French
My French is Okish at best, definitely enough to get by but nowhere near as fluent as my English is
If somebody is completely bilingual (like completely native in German and French) that's still impressive to me
Just a whole other level I'll probably won't ever be able to reach
I would say that I know a decent amount of English, but every damn time I have to ... you know ... actually speak it - I always feel like I've lost all memory
"Excuse me, do you know where I can find this restaurant
"Yes ju hev to go ova der den left"
Why am i like this
Unless you know the person extremely well (good friend/regular visitor) or were specifically asked to get something out of the fridge, yes it's seen as rude
And it's also weird
Basically, don't do it unless you were asked to do so
Yes it is very rude in Switzerland unless you are giving permission
**France:**
I like the culture of having to greet each other before making a request/transaction/what have you
It humanizes interactions
i.e: (At a department store)
**Bonjour** can I help you
Which leads me to
**Germany:**
Whereas in Germany, people don't feel the need to greet you prior to interactions (in my French example they tend to go straight to "Can I help you
What I appreciate about Germans (specially in the service sector) is that they take their time to explain/help you out if you request it
Which conversely I think it's one of the biggest weaknesses of the French
Germans feel it's their job to be thorough and I appreciate that as a customer or someone that needs help
I ended up buying a Zwilling nail cutter at an airport store in Frankfurt only because the lady spent an inordinate amounts of time explaining me the difference between all of them
It cost me 12 EUR
Meanwhile (in France) I was once trying to decide between 3 different bottles of champagne
All around 50+ EUR and the French dude basically said "I don't know what you like
so you decide"
**Italy:**
Apero culture is the best
Order an Aperol Spritz
Get small pizzas with anchovies
Not a fan of anchovies but I'll always say yes to free food
And it's DELICIOUS
I really like the mindset of the EU and the idea of a united European peninsula
however, I also like the idea of Swiss neutrality and independence :p
**Germany** Those guys know how to party, very polite people who love to help
**France** Beautiful art and the language sounds unbelievably pretty, learning it atm
**Italy** Breathtaking scenery, super yummy food and I love that you're so passionate about it
**Austria** Sadly only been to Bregenz, wanna visit Vienna and Salzburg too, beautiful country
**Liechtenstein** It's like a cute mini-me-version of Switzerland and I love that it's only 20 mins away from me :)
How laid back they are compared to us
Here everyone is really strict
If you‘re more then 5 minutes late to a meeting they will call you and ask if everything is ok and if you have trouble finding the place
Oh and also Pizza
The prices
Love living close to the German border <3
After going on a summer trip with a camper van in Germany, I became envious of two things:
They have (and much like a majority of nothern countries) bicycle roads ONLY FOR BICYCLES
Because let me tell you, here a lot of people hate bicycles, and in some cities, if you try to ride a bike, you'll have a 1/4 chance of getting in some accident
They have not only clean campings, but also places especially made for camper vans, which I simply couldn't find in counties like France or Switzerland
Meanwhile (in France) I was once trying to decide between 3 different bottles of champagne
All around 50+ EUR and the French dude basically said "I don't know what you like
so you decide"
Could happen anywhere if the staff can’t be bothered/are hungover
Not sure which part of CH you’re from but this happens to me regularly in German-speaking CH
I was in a bakery once where there was a choice between two kinds of mandelgipfeli (sugar or glazing) I was really just trying to practice my Swiss German by having banter with the assistant, but it failed miserably
This has never happened in France e.g. Paris, Montpellier, from my experience
Then you might like norway even more
They are even crazier about winter sports
Also, they have way more nature than we do
The architecture is really different tho
This wasn't Carrefour, it was an independent spirits/wine store
The assumption is (to me and maybe it's incorrect) that if you open/run a store of that sort you should more or less have some say in these type of questions
To the contrary
I'm in the opinion that it's much easier to describe why I like (say) one type of beer over another and give recommendations accordingly
Like clear differences in taste, feel between wheat/white beers, lagers, pale ales, lambics, dubbels, etc
But something like the iOS v. Android debate seems to be even more subjective to one's personal tastes/preferences
First i thought Christoph Blocher, but then i thought, nah he's gonna die soon
An now i think Roger Köppel
He's a far right politician and writer at the german "newspaper" *Weltwoche*
I guess we probably know who you are talking about
I‘m sorry
We don't want him either, so don't get any ideas
[link for the lazy]
My favorite part:
>> He proposed setting up large fans on the borders to blow airborne radioactive waste into the Baltic states
It's as accurate as Democratic People's Republic of North Korea
Switzerland is quite strict
No names that would hurt the child's wellbeing
This includes names that can be offensive for other cultures or names that when combined with the surname end up sounding ridicolous (my mother knew a woman called "rosa capezzoli" which translates to "pink nipples")
No names that do not align with the baby's gender
No names of negative figures from religious texts
No brand names (you can't call your baby "adidas")
No names that double as a toponym unless they already exist in the parents' language ("Asia" is fine, "nottingham" isn't)
No made up names
No names that are typically surnames
George Foreman in shambles
Friend of mine is Brazilian of Italian origin and has the same name as his father but Junior
Italian authorities refused it, so he had to legally change his name to include "Junior".
Uhm I think it's usually Jonathan with just one h but yeah
Ah right, that exists too, though interestingly enough unrelated to the other one
Maybe that's where the G comes from in your example, the Italian for John would be Giovanni from what I know so it's actually correct here
But there are probably spellings like Jo(h)vanni out there too nowadays lol
Ah right, that exists too, though interestingly enough unrelated to the other one
Maybe that's where the G comes from in your example, the Italian for John would be Giovanni from what I know so it's actually correct here
But there are probably spellings like Jo(h)vanni out there too nowadays lol
Ah that makes sense
I've started learning Italian a bit and this makes remembering the spelling of words a lot easier
The only thing you have I believe is the ho, hai, ha thing
The Technorama in Winterthur
It teaches science in a playful way
For me, the national transport museum in Lucerne
The national railway museum of the UK is great, but the Swiss museum is even better as it also includes other modes of transport
Surprisingly the exhibition that I loved the most, besides trains, were the cable cars
That really depends, but for me:
Art: [Fondation Beyeler] in Basel (also the most visited artmuseum in Switzerland)
Technology/science: [Swiss Science Center Technorama] in Winterthur
Historical: [Freilichtmuseum Ballenberg] near Brienz (open-air museum, seasonal)
Natural History: (haven't been to any in quite a while
Military History: [Flieger Flab Museum] in Dübendorf (literaly: Plane Antiaircraft Museum)
Zoo: Zooh
in Zürich
&#x200B;
And some odd-Balls that are definitely worth the trip:
Criminal/criminal history: [Kriminalmuseum der Kantonspolizei Zürich] in the headquarters of the cantonal police of Zürich (only guided tours - parts of it are not for the faint of heart )
Former military fortress and now
military and crystal exhibitions:  [Sasso San Gottardo] on the Gotthard mountain pass
&#x200B;
**Note:** Some of them have reduced opening hours or are only open for guided tours at the moment, for obvious reasons
&#x200B;
edit: Links and further information
we've got the Landesmuseum in Zurich, which is great for the history of Switzerland itself and the country's story
there's also the Verkehrshaus in Luzern which is great to go to with children and its all about transportation and technologies like that
then there's the Technorama in Winterthur, which is another one that is incredibly great for kids and its got a ton of cool science exhibits, most of which are interactive and fun to play with and as a child I always had time fly by way too fast in the Technorama
[Das Tram-Musemu Zürich]
Pretty fun and entertaining
Fun fact: the tickets to the museum look like old tram tickets, and you actually need to validate them at the entrance
I tend to appreciate it when people try, though it can be annoying if their skills are so bad that I either can’t understand them at all or it’s prolonging our interaction inconveniently
It’s also annoying if they refuse help
Also, please be aware of how appropriate the setting is language practice
With friends or in casual settings, my tolerance is a lot higher for language learners, compared to if I’m in a business setting or at work, or in a rush somewhere
I lived in Germany for a few years, during the time that my German was A2 to B2
When I tried to speak to any German person in German, they were always absurdly patient with me, and if I didn’t understand, they basically dropped everything until I did
Like, honestly, I have never met a people more motivated to help a non-native speaker find the Aldi before, or explain how the bus stop had moved, or get my kids registered for school
And all this in a country where even my garbageman spoke great English
Amazing
That attitude was one of my top 5 favorite things about living there
either chocolate, cheese or the smell of pine forests
That smell of cheese fondue that lingers in your home for hours and hours after eating one
Yes
Because it would terminate the business model of a huge mafia overnight, and police forces could get back to fighting actual crime
I thought the Kingdom of Syldavia was a real country in the Balkans because of the comic 'The Adventure of Tintin'
Also as a french speaker watching french TV as a kid, seeing all these incredible adds about products and fast foods that didn’t exist in Switzerland made France look like a magical place
You'll get plenty recommendations for major cities
Here is my take with second-tier cities:
* Bern, CH
* Aache, DE
* Stockholm, SE
* Gdańsk, PL
* Grodno, BY (once the situation settles down there, right now it isn't safe)
With apologies to Swedes for calling Stockholm "second tier". It certainly isn't Paris or London
But it's my favorite city in Europe
Right
I think Bern might be longitudinally too close to Aachen to
Dated albanian swiss and serbian swiss women
Wouldnt do it again, dealing with their racists families wasnt worth it in the end
Dated a French girl 5 years ago
It was long distance but we saw eachother every 3 months
It was good while it lasted but she didn't have feelings anymore after 2 and a half years so we ended the relationship there
Never spoken to her since because I don't like speaking to exes, it's always awkward and more often than not I still have feelings for a while after a breakup
The distance made it easier to accept things and I had no chance to bump into her at the supermarket, unlike my more recent ex
We have them too but we're less focused on them and they are different
For example, the baby boomers don't start immediately after the war, but go from 1954 to 1964 or something and before that it's the 'post war kids' or something
In Europe, we couldn't do the boom immediately because there was cleanup to be done after the war
And then it goes like X, Y, Z. Don't know the exact years though
That‘s fucked up
we usually write "ä" in Swiss German to say what would be "eine" in high German
U (which means "and", but we also sometimes say und)
Ä ( which means "a". Like in: a house)
Standard German doesn't, but some Swiss German dialects have quite a few (although there is no official Swiss German orthography, it's only written in informal contexts)
Most of these do not occur in all dialects:
* *a* - syonymous to Standard "an [den]" (~to [the])
Pronounced long (sometimes written aa/ah), it corresponds to Standard "an" (a detachable verb prefix)
* *ä*/*e* - masculine and/or neutral indefinite article
* *i* - syonymous to Standard "in [den]" (~into [the])
Pronounced long, it corresponds to Standard "ein" (a detachable verb prefix) and/or the pronoun "ich" (I/me)
* *o* (long) - equivalent to "auch" (also/too)
* *u* - equivalent to "und" (and)
Pronounced long, it is used as an intensifier (like very/hella) in a few dialects
Some are just consonants, although I guess it's debatable whether those are true words or just clitics:
* *d* - feminine definite article
* *s* - neutral definite article
* *z* - roughly equivalent to Standard "in" (~in/at) for geographical statements, and "zu" (~to) in some other contexts
I’d say there’s also 'ô' as in 'ô mon roi'
Rinderkennzeichungs- und Rindfleischettikierubgsaufgabenübertragungsüberwachungsgesetz
Yeah in Swiss German too: "i" for I, "o" for "also", "ä" for "a/an", "u" for "and", "d" for "the (feminine)", "z" for "at".
How come
I'm not Mexican but this was such a huge meme :o (idk maybe it was just in Peru
But I feel like I saw it quite a lot
Fair enough xD
Swiss people are infamous for being extremely private about their income
We even have a saying that goes: "You don't talk about money, you simply have it
So yes, while there are exceptions such as myself (I'm totally fine talking about my income), Swiss people over all consider it very rude to ask others how much money they have or what they make
I know people who don't even talk about this stuff with their close family members
Money is easily the biggest taboo topic in Switzerland
Swiss here
We don't talk about money
Like, at all
I think this is mostly true for the older generations, most people I know who are  my age (I’m 24) have absolutely no issues with talking about money
But, the topic rarely comes up
Even though I have no reservations in talking about it, it‘s just not such a common topic in Switzerland
It‘s certainly very taboo in many older generations
I would also say Swiss people are infamous for being extremely private, period
I don‘t know if money is THE biggest taboo topic, since there are so many big taboos, I’d venture to say that especially in the older generations there are other topics which are just as taboo as money
I personally don‘t really enjoy this taboo culture, I like to talk about anything and everything:)
I think black olives are more popular here, but I don't like both kinds
While there are many, surely soon to be pointed out by other redditors, I think it is interesting to also consider the one big failure:
A program written in ADA caused an exception, resulting from the conversion of data from a 64-bit floating point format to a 16-bit signed integer, leading to an “Operand Error”.
That, boys and girls, [is how one turns 775 tonnes of rocket including 4 satellites into confetti]
No, not everyone is fluent in all the other languages; though most people know enough to survive if for some reason they get stranded in another part of the country
For example my French isn't great and my Italian is extremely basic but they're sufficient to ask for help, order food and get a hotel room
Generally speaking, the bilinguality of people also depends on how closely they grow up and live to the language border
For example if you're from St
Gall, your French will probably be less fluent than if you're from Bern
If you're from Biel/Bienne, you may be fully bilingual
Likewise, people from Lausanne will probably be better at German than those who grow up in Geneva
And the same rule is true for German/Italian and French/Italian (and there's also Romansch)
Being able to speak the other national languages used to be considered extremely important in Switzerland in the old days
For example my grandmother and many others in her generation went on an au-pair year to another part of the country
In those days, becoming fluent at another national language was viewed as a type of patriotic duty
After all, Switzerland is a nation of will and the way we keep and strengthen our community is by practising a culture of exchange and togetherness
Unfortunately in my opinion, this attitude has become significantly weaker in Switzerland over the past few decades
These days, English is increasingly being used as a lingua franca even within our country and people are losing the ability to speak with their countrymen and -women in French, German or Italian
The language of instruction in Swiss schools depends from Canton to Canton
In Ticino, it's Italian
In the Cantons of Geneva, Vaud, Fribourg, Neuchâtel and Jura, it is French
In the Canton of Wallis/Valais, it depends on the region
In all the other Cantons, the language of instruction is standard German
It's important to note that standard German is not the same as what "German"-speaking Swiss people actually use in their everyday life
In fact, children who grow up in Basel, Zurich or Bern have to learn standard German in elementary school
It doesn't come to us naturally
The starting point and duration of foreign language teaching in Swiss schools also depends from Canton to Canton
For example my French lessons began at age 11 (grade 5)
In some places this happens later
In recent years, the linguistic battle between English and the foreign national languages has also become a hot iron in Swiss politics
When I grew up in the 1990s, it was still widely accepted that children should first learn German/French and later move on to English
These days, many Cantons have shifted to a model where children first learn English and then move on to German/French
As a tendency, it is the German speakers in Switzerland who are most welcoming of this cultural and political shift
This is not surprising since we are the most powerful/linguistically privileged group in this country
It is easy for us to ignore French; more so than for our French speaking countrypeople to ignore German
If push comes to shove, Romand and Ticinesi culture are more threatened to go extinct or be overtaken than German-Swiss culture
This can also be seen when you look at Swiss national politics
Most Romand and Ticinesi politicians are fluent at German, while many German-native politicians struggle to deliver a speech in Italian or French
In the Swiss national parliament, everyone gets to use his/her native language thanks to an arsenal of interpreters
However, this doesn't change the fact that German is subtly viewed as a must-know by most of those politicians
Some Romands are rather frustrated by this condition and I can understand them well
It is not a fair situation but unfortunately one that is almost impossible to change due to the demographic power dynamics
This being said, I also believe that Switzerland is doing a pretty good job overall to keep its different cultural parts connected
Contrary to Belgium, we have never had any serious animosities between the different regions; at least not in recent decades
Despite the hurdles and problems I have mentioned above, I think Swiss people are still very much cherishing the cultural and linguistic diversity of their country
I, for one, certainly feel emotionally closer to a person from Lausanne or Geneva than a person from Paris
Rationally, this doesn't make any sense and you could say it's a little stupid but I think it also shows a certain feeling of national unity that transcends linguistic borders and in my opinion this is something positive
Lots of my young friends here in german speaking switzerland laugh about themselves not being able to speak french
Sadly most of them can only speak english, some can even speak better spanish than french, even if we started spanish classes at age 14 and french at 11
I think of it as some sort of a patriotic duty to learn at least french
I also know lots of people who speak better italian than french (also started learning with 15)
I don't like this trend that les romandes are expected to speak german while the swiss-german always speak german with anyone
Often english is used between the different linguistic groups, also in the military, at least among the recruits
I talked lots about the german-romandes relation because it is way worse with italian
I always feel shit when i go to ticino and have to speak german or english because i don't speak italian
However, i don't have that feeling when i cross the border to como in italy
I also have to say that it is only obligatory to learn one other language in school
So we only have to learn french and then we can chose to learn italian, but we can also chose spanish or another subject
I think in all the other linguistic regions they have to learn german
The first comment summed everything up pretty good
I'm currently practising my french (A2/B1) in order to be able to speak with my fellow people
If you want to see some demonstrations I highly recommend the Swiss press conferences about the COVID pandemic
Posted it on another comment here:
Thank you for writing this, otherwise I would have felt the obligation of doing so and probably wouldn't have done such a good job
Two additions: 1
in the Romansh speaking areas (parts of Graubünden) Romansh actually is the language of instruction in school but they start to learn German as a forgein language at an early age and pretty much everyone is bilingual
They also come into contact with German a lot so this is natural and in gymnasium most students choose German as their language of instruction
In Ticino, Lombardian dialects (Ticines) are spoken, but unlike Romansh they aren't an official language
They are intelligible to other Lombardian dialects but other speakers of Italian can't understand them
In Bregaglia, a valley in southern Graubünden, another Lombardian dialect is spoken
There is also the local Bargaiot, based on Lombardian, combines Italian, Rumansh and even some German
In most parts of the Romandie the spoken language used to be Franco-Provençal
Now it is only spoken in the municipality of Évolène, but also not as an official language
This is a personal statement
I find it sad that people use English as a lingua franca
We have four recognised languages as well as some others, we don't need to import a new one
Replacing this multilingualism with English would be a loss
Not knowing another national language also shows that you don't care what the others do over there
The concept is 'chacun à sa langue' not 'ok we're using another language that isn't even native to this country'.
To add to the whole politics german/french situation: I highly recommend watching some press conferences of the whole covid pandemic
They're a great example for being able to have mixed conversations, many occurrences of reporters asking in French and getting a German answer and vice versa
And even the people giving the speech switch around and mostly have the full details in their own language but abbreviate them again in another one in French/German and sometimes Italian
And they all take care to be easily understandable
I wouldn't consider myself fluent in French even though I learned it for more than 8 years in School but those press conferences are no problem for me to understand
They're on YouTube, search for Point de presse (by BAG or the Swiss Federal Council)
>found signs and supermarket labels often written only in French and German
When a third language was available, it was English
Well to be fair legally signs and labels only have to be written in the local language
Now if the company wants to write more it can and yeah usually it will pick the most used: German and English
Products with labels in more languages are usually imported
>The fact that many couldn't understand one of their national languages annoyed me greatly at the beginning
You cannot expect us to be fluent in 5 languages
That's a highly unrealistic expectation
So the mindset among my school collegues is that the french classes are boring and that it's hard to learn
I think some of them prefer other langagues because they are able to chose them themselves at a much more mature age
My willingness to learn french only came when i grew older
I also think that they still need to learn what it means to live in a multilingual country
As far as i know, there haven't been any tension in our country concerning languages
They just prefer english because you use that almost on a daily basis with the internet
There's the thing we call Röstigraben
(Seemingly the German part eats Rösti, French part doesn't really)
This stands for the social and cultural differences we have between those regions, you can see it in votes and elections, the French part often has a different opinion than the German part
And in the Military, if you're stationed in one part, the few people that speak the other language usually hang out together and those are the ones that fuck up the most
Obviously cause nobody takes the time to explain everything twice so as long as no one asks questions it's assumed everybody understood, what leads to misunderstandings and so on
Just in the nature of things and the environment
It's not really a tense situation
We love each other very much, especially for those differences
But we like to poke fun at each other
I've heard that it's considered inappropriate to speak dialects in Italy so that doesn't really surprise me
You are basically replacing your dialects with the variation from Rome which is basically what France did with Parisian French a few hundred years ago (I think it was then)
As a french speaker, I feel like the situation is a bit similar here
I mean we’re notorious for being bad at German I think, and since it’s not even the language you use there’s a certain disdain about having to learn it in school
It’s also a difficult language
However German in school was a compulsory subject (at least for me, I did 7 years of German as compulsory classes, and 3 as optional ones in High School, but it will vary between cantons) as opposed to Italian which has always only been an option
Italian is closer to French obviously, so I think many people like to learn it better than German
Yes, that is a normal thing here that happens for Kindergarten
Children are taught independence very early, and that includes making it to school
Kids wear a special yellow sash/vest with a reflector light and it has their name and address and school on it in case they encounter trouble
It is not unusual to see children about age 5 or 6 on a public transport tram alone or in small groups on their way to school
I live in the third largest city in Switzerland, which is small compared to most other countries, but the metro area is a little more than half a million people
Yes, it's normal
Kids are encouraged to walk alone as soon as they start Kindergarten (age 4)
In the first days and weeks, a parent will usually accompany them, but later, walking alone is considered an essential part of the Kindergarten/school experience
That being said, many kids walk in groups of children and most of the time, the Kindergarten isn't too far away
Usually like 5-15mins (there are exceptions, but at least in my town, we had a school bus for kids who had to walk long distances)
I'm not sure I would consider Swiss drivers as particularly safe, but I think walking alone to school is just part of our culture
It also gave me a lot of confidence when I was 4/5
Lessons on road safety and how to behave around cars are part of the Swiss curriculum and they are usually taught by the police
I remember my Kindergarten class practising crossing streets with a local police officer
The police didn't come every week, but they returned regularly throughout the years
In Kindergarten, they even gifted us an audiobook about road safety for kids, which I listened to frequently when I was younger
One common mistake is "make a picture" instead of "take a picture", because in (Swiss) German, we make them (ein Foto machen)
I often mess up convenient and comfortable
I know which one is which but somehow have to stop myself quite often mid sentence to correct myself
Both translate to "bequem" in German so maybe that's the reason behind my mistake
My Turkish boss recently had to say the word “sewing” out loud for what I assume was the first time and pronounced it “suing”. Totally legitimate guess, but wrong word altogether
I know someone who doesn’t like to remember verbs in past tense so he uses the do auxiliary for everything
So instead of, “I called you yesterday,” it’s “I did call you yesterday
” Instead of “I ate at that restaurant last week,” it “I did eat at that restaurant last week
” Instead of “I already submitted the proposal,” “I did already submit the proposal
It makes him sound so emphatic
I find it very charming
In Swiss German, we "do" a lot, e.g. "Ich tue dä Abfall use" (I'm taking out the garbage)
Also common in questions, e.g. "Tuesch hüt no wäsche
" (Are you doing laundry today
There's other ways to say or ask these things, but that's one of them
That's also true for German (ein Foto schießen), but not for Swiss German
That doesn't really work in Swiss German, but you can "make someone legs" (jemandem Beine machen) if you want them to hurry up ;-)
Mine was in my Erasmus semester in Sweden when I wanted to get my login for the university account
I approached the counter and was explained in Swedish that I needed to take a ticket
Ok, did that, waited and went back to the counter
I started in English (my Swedish wasn't good enough for such situations) until I had to show my ID card
The woman behind the counter asked from what region I was from (it's Zurich) and for the rest I was served in Wallis German
Later I met a guy at a party also from Wallis
I wouldn't have recognised if no-one had told me, not surprising because his mother tongue was French
The latter is probably the normal case for Swiss people abroad: German speakers don't recognise francophone or Italian Swiss but more likely the other way
I was in Amsterdam with a good friend and we were eating dinner in this very nice Italian restaurant
The food was excellent, and there was this very charismatic waiter
When he brought us our drinks he heard us talking a bit in Swiss german, then asked "Sind ihr au Schwizer
" (_'Are you guys Swiss as well
'_)
We were very surprised as Swiss people are much harder to find in foreign countries than German people
So we had a good laugh and talked for a bit
He told us that he grew up in Basel and later moved to Amsterdam when he was still young
He brought us some free Limoncello afterwards
Very nice experience
Switzerland issues one with your passport IIRC
Everything is in 5 languages
They are issued to everyone, regardless of age
Since I don't have a Swiss ID, here's what a [Portuguese] one looks like from the front
And apparently I'm unable to find a good resolution [picture] of both sides
>Switzerland issues one with your passport IIRC
Only if you ask for one when issuing the passport
You can choose to get the ID, the passport or both (price will be different of course)
The passport and the ID can be issued separately
I had an ID card basically since I was born, but only got my passport made when I was 17
I have had both since I was born
You don't have to have an ID/passport when travelling inside the Schengen-Area
From Switzerland at least you must have one of those things
I (31, swiss) dodged it in school
It was not taught in elementary school back then when I was a kid, and it was not mandatory yet in highschool
I chose English as an elective subject for half a year but didn't continue after that because it was sooooooooooo boring
I think I couldn't stand it because I was already way above the skill level they tried to teach us
And that was mostly due to online multiplayer games and MMORPG's (mostly GuildWars as I wasn't into WoW because I was poor af and the monthly subscription didn't appeal to me)
My English skills were quite limited when I started playing these games at first, but after a while they basically 'forced' me to communicate with other people in English - in writing and later also in voice chats
Also I joined a few international forums (yeah, it was quite a while ago
Are forums still a thing
) and got harshly corrected for my inferior grammar there - there are quite a few mistakes I learned to avoid that way :D (your, you are, you're)
When I joined university, I was still feeling insecure about my English skills and was intimidated by the amount of English literature I suddenly had to read
Oh boy, in my first year there I was reading that stuff with google translate open, basically
I learned a lot of new words quickly and during that time I also decided that I really have to improve my English so I started switching language to English whenever possible
I watched movies in English with English subtitles - and played games whenever possible in English as well
Vocabulary greatly increased with Minecraft and strategy/city building games, really
I felt comfortable to write my first scientific essay in English when I was almost finished with my bachelor's degree
I felt insecure about it first but the tutor - a native English speaker - told me that it was well written and that raised my confidence
In the last few years I started working in academia as well and suddenly I had to communicate in English every day because the research group was very international
I also had to write in English every day - mails, applications, scientific papers
I also made a few new friends from all over the world in the process
These days I almost text more in English than in German on a daily basis, and i read, watch and listen to more English content than German too
I can't watch German dubbed movies or tv-shows anymore, and most game translations make me cringe so hard I can't stand it anymore
so TLDR: games, more games, and academia forcing me to use English on a daily basis
In 2nd grade (schools in Zurich work like that) and I improved it my frequent visits to England with my family
Mainly from TV channels like Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, Boomerang, and Disney
And then Discovery and Nat Geo as I got older
As for the improvement bit, English is so pervasive in day-to-day life that it isn't that hard to come across native speakers
Yes it's weird, isn't it
The only reason i could dodge it was because my class was basically the last one with the old system in the last year the old system was in place
The old system would have required me to pick English in the next Semester in high school for the last 2 years of high school
The new system however was already in place for the students below my class, and for them English was already mandatory
With the new system, they were not required to take English in the final 2 years of high school because they already had it
The year i would have been required to pick English, they switched systems entirely
Therefore i was no longer required to take it, nor did i have the mandatory courses the newer students had
Only option for me was the electives course and that one sucked so i quit it after half a year :P
but a thousand of pictures of things with names attached
I know many words for different types of wood now :P
I had a friend who spent her Erasmus year in (southern) Germany
Now, while Germany by itself isn't a weird place or destination, I thought it was a bit strange for a university student from the northern part of Switzerland to go on an exchange year to southern Germany
I mean
this is the one year where you have the opportunity to go literally *anywhere you want*. I spent a year studying in South Korea
I know a guy who spent a year in China
You could go to Uruguay or Namibia
And even if you prefer to stay in Europe
you could go to Iceland
Or Portugal
Or Russia
But southern Germany
I mean, her exchange university was located near enough that she could come home by train and spend her weekends at home
I guess it worked for her, so that's good but I find that a bit strange
Honestly, no
I know a lot of people feel this way but in my opinion, you're only 20-something once and
yolo
Before I went on my exchange year, I had already wasted time on learning Latin, which my home university forced me to do for my majors
Down the line, nobody really cares if you graduate at age 25 or 28
It's like your final grades in your high school diploma
you may think they're important in the moment but 20 years later, nobody will care about them (not even you)
On the other hand, there are moments in life when you are presented with a unique opportunity to make a special experience and I believe you should grab those opportunities
They may never return
I'm not saying you necessarily have to go outside of Europe but I do believe the experience should be priority number one
You'll have your whole life to work on your career
Statistically, you'll be spending more time at work during the next 40 years than with your friends, romantic partner or children
There are just two relatively short periods in life where you are somewhat free: your late teens and 20s before life becomes super serious and your early retirement before you get too old and sick to be very active
In my opinion, these periods should be used to the fullest
But see, that second part is exactly what I personally find weird
To me, a big part of an exchange year is growing up and maturing
Having to deal with things on your own or finding people who help you if you encounter problems
If you can just take a train for 2 hours and go ask your parents for help, that kind of defeats the purpose of an exchange year
Or at least ONE of the purposes
Erasmus isn't the only study-abroad program
And like I said, you don't *have* to go outside of Europe
Just
y'know, maybe go a bit further than 200km across the border
I'm convinced I can recognize french women
It's mostly their style that gives them away I think and a minor part are facial features
But that's it
Sometimes italian or german but that's more hit or miss
- "Hopp de Bäse" literally "Go that Broom (??)" means hurry up
- "Läck Bobbi" literally "Lick Bobby" said when shocked, astonisched at something
- "Dr schnäller isch dr Gschwinder" lit
"the faste ome is the swifter one", first come first serve
-  "chasch nid s Föifi und s Weggli ha" lit
"you can't have the 5fr coin and the bread roll", means you can't have everything
- "Blos mer doch id Schueh", lit
"blow into my shoes", fuck off
- "Rütsch mer dr Buckel ab", lit
"Slide down my hunchback", fuck off
- "Mach kei Büro uff", lit
"Don't open up an office", don't make things complicated
- "Mit allnä Wasser gwäsche", lit
"Washed with all waters", someone being sneaky/treacherous
Can confirm, I know all of those as well (except for the sausage ham one)
Oh we have that one too
But instead of a stallion it's an elephant
No, it doesn't at all actually
We say: "Du sollst aus einer Mücke nicht gleich einen Elefanten machen
Yeah we know about the Académie here, and some of us might comply with it, but it has even less influence than it has in France so it’s not very relevant
Is it somehow related to the Alliance Française
I always asumed it was the Cambridge English Language Assesment, but now that I think about it that doesn't really make sense at it is for non native speakers while the RAE does way more than just give language certificates
That's the most RAE thing I read today
Not really with French, but definitely the case with German
One time someone thought I was french after hearing me speak
I told him I was Swiss but of course he took it as that I was from Sweden
I found it funny so I didn’t correct him, and now I like to think that there’s at least one guy out there who thinks they speak french in Sweden
Every freakin time
You're a French speaker
You must be from France
The only time it helps me was when I am on holidays and someone's asking me where I am from
I often say France, as Switzerland is always assimilated to rich people
It stops them from trying to sell me some expensive scam ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
But one downside of being a French speaking country which isn't France is when it comes to French youtubers
They're doing a tour
Only in France
They're selling merch
Only in metropolitan France
Kinda the same goes for some singers
This happens to me and my family all the time
What about Italian and Romansh
Well, we ve have a [beach]  too
W-Nuss vo Bümpliz by Patent Ochsner
The scottish people from the karaoke bar on Lanzarote seemed to enjoy it
and you have Manele music
Great song in a room full of drunk people
Suddenly everyone sings along
Have always thought you guys sound Scottish
I think that’s why I enjoy Swiss German more than Hoch Deutsch
For the longest time I only knew Deichkind from "Leider Geil" it was only recently that someone showed me some other songs by them (1000 Jahre Bier is great)
There's a different dialect every 2 kilometres or so
When i was in secondary school, my teacher showed us a website that could track down our position by asking us questions about the words we are using
The site managed to locate the exact town i grew up in, thus leading me to think there are indeed variations of dialect from village to village
Major ones ? No, clearly not, but they are many differences
Also, this was in the French speaking part of Switzerland, who isn't nearly as known for having dialect compared to the German/Romanche speaking part
This also applies to Switzerland Idk about the Romanic Part, but in Swiss German Allemanic Dialects vary very fast from one village to the other
Dialects are basically dead in Romandie
Only older people, in more isolated villages, still speak their local "patois".
This is exactly how it is in Switzerland, except that we have no King
Not an expert, but I'd say it's mostly due to Romandie having a lot fewer isolated areas
Everywhere is "near a city" so the common French has spread a lot easier
Cuckoo clocks are Swabian
I can only think of something that is the other way around
Everyone always acts like Switzerland was neutral and didn't do anything and that we're the nice ones
While we didn't go to war, that's about it
This country definetly isn't innocent
(Polish part of my soul speaking)
Sex ed
Seems to exist everywhere else
Some Gymnasiums in Switzerland still teach Classical Latin and Ancient Greek as a mandatory subject
I don't know how common that is in other countries
A diploma in Latin is also required at many Swiss universities to study certain fields in the humanities such as History
At my Gymnasium, we had gymnastics as a mandatory class in addition to regular PE
It was basically a dance class
We also had to attend musical instruments class as a mandatory addition to regular music class
Upon entering Gymnasium, every student had to pick a musical instrument of their choice - for example I picked the guitar
Contrary to regular music class which we attended with everyone else, musical instrument class was usually a teacher with 1-3 students per lesson (I was always alone with my teacher)
There were exams just like in every other class and the grade of our final exam had the same weight as that in math or French
It's also mandatory here in Switzerland, also grades 7-9
We have it in Switzerland and I was probably the only guy to like it haha
Here it's not mandatory but depending on the regional rules about high schools it's possible to switch from mandatory english classes to ancient greek and from mandatory french to italian
The second one actually makes sense considering both are official national languages here but the greek one is used by noone, just a strange relict of the past
I actually had most of this during primary school, so grades 4 to 6 (only little emphasis on cooking, though, mostly crafting, sewing etc
Also, the situation is more nuanced in grades 7-9 and depends on whether you go to a middle school or to a high-school (gymnasium) directly after primary school
Afaik, it's not mandatory in high-schools
At least not when I went to school in Zürich
In Aargau we had sewing (2-6), crafting (1-6) and cooking/cleaning/nutrition (7)
We have the small village of [St-Gingolph] that’s literally split in half between Switzerland and France (Wiki in french for the pictures, but it exists in english)
There’s even a [custom house] in the middle of the village
I’ve been there once, and it’s pretty striking how different the atmosphere in the two halves of the village is, you can really tell they don’t belong to the same country
Basel is considered a swiss city but the suburbs stretch into germany and france
There is 3 train stations: a swiss, a german and a french one
i think Rheinfelden is also a good example
You mean the one in Zürich
The one in Bern doesn't skip that part (if I remember well, haven't been there like in a year)
Edit: I just remembered the one in Bern is the historical museum, so I guess you mean the one in Zürich
How do Austrians view the Anschluss today
Depending on who I talk with they either see themselves as victims or collaborators of nazi germany
**German**: 100%
Native
**English**: 100%
**Norwegian/Danish/Swedish**: 25%.
Sorry man, the sentences just look too different even if individual words look recognisable
**Dutch/Afrikaans**: 90%
Absolutely no problem
The only hiccups are a few words
**Low German**: 95%
It's very familiar because even if people don't often speak Low German anymore, the stereotypical High German accent from the region still often makes use of its features like e.g. exchanging "s" for "t" and turning "t"s into "d"s.
**Luxembourgish**: 95%
See above, but with some different rules
**Icelandic**: 10%
Can only guess the gist because of recognisable place names
***BONUS:***
**Alemannic**: 99%
Not my dialect
Just wanted to say that there's also an Allemanic Wiki :)
I have two t shirts signed by nba players
I stopped wearing them because I got annoyed by all the people asking me who’s signing this is
They are now my pajama shirts
EU4: Tried Switzerland a few times, but never finished a run
I love HRE runs - I finished Austria -> HRE 2 times (both pre-1
30) and Brandenburg -> Prussia -> HRE once (post-1
30)
Apart from that, I mostly choose nations from all over the place, often randomly - one of my first finished runs was as the Indian kingdom of Orissa (pre-Dharma), and another one was as the East-African minor nation of Dongola
CK2: I loved playing vikings, but I realize they were pretty much easy mode
I also started a few games where I would randomly switch countries every time my ruler died or every 100 years, with the goal of exporting the save to EU4 and doinf the same thing there
I only continued a game in EU4 once, though - mostly I would lose interest beforehand, in part because bordergore would get worse and worse
CK3: I'm doing a viking run atm
Sadly, I think they're even more "easy mode" than in CK2
Stellaris: I mostly play materialistic, egalitarian empires
I sometimes feel like I'm the only Stellaris player not commiting war crimes
Berlin
I was planning to go there with a friend at the end of May, but we had to cancel it
I really want to visit it, I just love the vibe of the city, the art scene with the museums, theaters and the nightlife as well
You got scammed like hell
Well, my kids are in primary school in Switzerland right now, and they definitely know where Switzerland is on a map
It’s possible that the reason the kids in your example didn’t know who the president was is that there isn’t really a “president” like in the US—there’s a 7-person federal council with a rotating leader
The only reason I know who the current president is is that he grew up in a village near where I live now
And it’s possible, depending on the age of the kids, that they hadn’t learned European geography yet
In 6P (9-10), the kids learn about reading maps by studying the map of their own canton (state)
Switzerland is very federalist—in general, local is much more important than central
So they learn about their canton before they learn about their country
Saw two campers with chinese license plates a few years ago
Clear like rock water xDD Never heard that one translated to English
Had to read it twice to understand why it sounded funny
Crystal clear would be the English version, but I now prefer l'eau de roche literally translated :)
Generalizations but
Swiss Germans root for Germany
Swiss French for France
Swiss Italians for Italy
* Italy
* Whomever is playing against France o)
Yes, France or Switzerland because I'm from both
If there is a match between them I will root for Switzerland
If there is none of them, I will go case by case
I loved the Iceland soccer team during the Euro in 2016
I don't know what I'm doing
I'm just doing some random things, but I usually support the neighbours, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, Japan and Greece and then some random others, depending on who is available in the first place
Swiss Germans do not root for Germany
Also generalizing, of course
As a Swiss French believe me no one roots for France except the French themselves
Especially not during the last world cup
I usually root for Germany, but that’s because my grandfather was German
Not the case in Geneva
Lots of support for France during the WC and Euros
How open italians are, I met some in france we didn't know eachother and they were full on cuddling etc
I kinda miss this now in Switzerland
Not OP either but I also see it with Brits abroad
Group of families I know befriended an "upper class" British family (whatever that means but they identified themselves as such)
And though they were courteous they generally wanted no part of any of us
Meaning we'd invite them over, get an excuse
One day one of families in the group brings up the fact that her parents are extremely well off
Which none of us were aware of, considering they live very modest lives
Like she remarked that her father takes private jets to go on ski holidays
Suddenly that British family wanted to be best friends with them and have their kids have play dates all the time
Not for the rest of us
I was in Bristol and got so tired of the small talk (specially Taxi drivers) that I started pretending I don't speak English
I dream of *accidentally* bombarding oe invading Lichtenstein, just like my forefathers before me
I think Switzerland should conquer Liechtenstein
... Yes, I'm joking
but only half-joking
They basically speak a Swiss dialect and they already use our currency so
On a completely serious note, though, I think the political system of Liechtenstein is absolutely ridiculous
Basically, they have direct democracy just like we do but with the key difference that the Prince gets to veto everything he wants
This led to the following, amazingly absurd situation: a couple of years ago, a group of citizens in Liechtenstein wanted to abolish the Prince's veto right
They wrote a popular initiative for a constitutional change and began to collect signatures
The idea was hugely popular, came to a vote and was approved by a large majority of the country's population
And guess what happened next
Yup, Mr
I-like-to-smell-my-own-farts-Prince-of-Liechtenstein vetoed the outcome of the vote
I mean, you've got to let that marinade in your brain
*he vetoed his population's decision to abolish his veto-right*. It would be funny if it weren't so sad
But hey, it's totally cool because last year, the population of Liechtenstein got to celebrate the 500-year anniversary of their monarchy
*Thank you so, so much dear Prince for ignoring our wishes and ruling over us in your pretentious castle while we common peasants get to line up at the street, clap in admiration and kiss your ass as you drive by in your luxury car*.
I don't know
I think it's time to spread some freedom and democracy in that country
I just learned recently that they have their own tiny Olympic-like games called [Games of the small States of Europe] and I just find it cute
Also apparently next year Vatican City is going to join, which blows my mind because I didn’t even know they had anything like athletes there
I hope we’ll get to see the Pope run the 100m, but I think there’s little chances
personally, I love liechtenstein
it's fun having this fellow central European, neutral, rich nation as a neighbour and they share a lot of things with us
other microstates, I like too
they make things interesting to me and they're a remnant of when things used to be different and I like that
They can't drive for shit tho
Somehow I can't find anything about this, only about the time when people actually voted for him to keep his veto right, and about the time he threatened to move to Austria if he didn't get more power in the country
Do you have a source
From what I've seen, they're pretty regular folks
The International Criminal Court (ICC) will decide whats wrong or right .... ohh wait
I'm staying neutral
And it will certainly not bring more stability and peace to this region of the world
> Big countries are above the law
Has nothing to do with the size
the US isn't part of the International Criminal Court (ICC) ...
Ze Germans
Just kidding
Nobody is going to invade us
They're all too scared
Besides, what kind of idiot would attack his own bank
Even Adolf had figured that one out
Liechtenstein
Tbf, he did have plans but didn't commit to them because it wouldn't be worth it
So our strategy technically worked
Liechtenstein has it's own Banks
The EU could invade and occupy your Parlament
Actually do Brexit and leave again
Imho the fastest way this will ever be solved
In Switzerland everyone knows this song:
There's some songs from "L'Abbé Bovet" which are beautiful, and some others are very funny
It's typical choir songs in my canton, but I'd say the catchiest I've ever sung (and I'm always happy to sing it again and again) is [Méli-mélo] from him
Edit: oh and some people will kill me for that, but if we change genres, I'm always up for singing [that] :)
Yes, I was going to say the same
I think the reason they went for this is because Hagrid dropped out of school early, so the implication is that he's not exactly a sophisticated person
I think he's supposed to sound a bit like some kind and caring but eccentric dude who's been living in his tent in a forest for the past 20 years
In Geneva we use *mascogne* which doesn't really have any meaning other than that to my knowledge
No etymology or origin either afaik
In regular French it's *antisèche* from the verb *sécher* which can mean go blank/dry up
We too call it „Spickzettel“ or sometimes just „Spick“
„Spick“ is also a childrens magazine here in Switzerland
bigino also in Ticino, Switzerland
That concept is too niche/new to have a word outside English I would say
We have had lockerd in the Gymnasium I've went to, I used mine for all my books and stuff but there were also people who didn't use theirs at all
Basically when you get to the school you get the key to your locker and you keep that until you leave, so I had mine for 8 years (grades 6-13)
We had lockers but you had to pay for them
Like at the start of the first year of high school you could decide if you wanted a locker for x amount of money per year (it was pretty cheap)
I think they just didn‘t have enough lockers for everyone
After a while they changed the system in my school, built new lockers and from then on i think everyone just got assigned to one
Not sure about the second lockers but on the first ones you had to install your own lock
Also the placement of the lockers wasn‘t that great
There where three rows of lockers on top of each other, it was kind of a narrow corridor and some people had to walk by
Often times it was very crowded there
And having multiple buildings for different classes you often still had to carry a few kgs of books and folders in your backpack
Otherwise you‘d have to run from one building to the one with the lockers and maybe to another building to get to your next class in ten minutes
And hope you get fast enough access to your locker in the crowded space
Had to do that a few times when I forgot something in there
Wasn‘t fun
Also many people came to school by public transport and many just came on time
I for example had to carry the books for the next morning with me otherwise I would be late for the class
But that‘s different for every school i guess
In middle and high school, yes
In primary, they often have space beneath their desks for books and stuff
Not really, but we do often have little "chapels" gilled with bones
Our entire country is basically one big bunker
We have huge bunkers in the mountains and every citizen needs to have a place in an underground bunker either in their house or buildings like schools and hospitals
In addition to bunkers for civilians there are the bunkers in the mountains for military use (even though more and more of those are getting closed or turned into museums and stuff)
Being located between some of the biggest warmongers in central european history made our military really paranoid
In case of war our main strategy is literally hide in the mountains/bunkers, blow up brigdes and tunnels (this can actually be done remotely at any time for many important tunnels and bridges) and just keep enemies out
&#x200B;
If you're interested some pictures and wikipedia article
[oh we really don’t stand out at all
Not standing out
The economy and we dont get involved in any disputes
Just chill in the middle
Trains, hella expensive places for tourists and beer that costs 6-7$ a pint in the town center
Well we have 4 official langauages, although one is almost extinguished
Its about 62% German 23% French 10% Italian and 5% Romansh
I remember in London people were always saying cheers mate !
I've got a boner for historic borders that are aesthetically pleasing
like the polish Lithuanian commonwealth at its height, or napoleonic France
the qing empire is also a nice one
some of the persian empires too
I could go on for days
I kinda like our shape, it's so cute and put together with two little arms
Italy, because it has all natural borders, either it‘s mountains or the sea
I will absolutely steal Swineland and use it from now on in map discussions
I find Switzerland kinda looks like a pig
I think it looks more like a fish
I love that, except for the North Germany part
how mental is it that they just randomly owned dalmatia
as an alternative, I like the look of the "Frances natural borders" idea, aesthetically speaking
The UK always looked like a bunny to me
stay neutral and try to start dialogue between the two parties
Well, your neighbour Spain apparently sent troops to help Turkey
Can you maybe shout over the border for them to stop
we can't really do anything else
Or it's easier to hide genocide outside of your borders as "war"...
Not saying it is the reason, but it is way easier to justify dead civilians in a war than in your own country
[Comment with a linked tweet]
To me, it leaves a bad taste in my mouth to even help them while they're committing such actions
Personally, I'd withdraw the support
But I see that they're there for (4
) years now, so that may be hard to do
Time to start a referendum in Switzerland, just give me about a year or two
I didn't fact check if any other country is similar to this, but because our country has 4 official languages (French, German, Italian, Rumantsch), in order not to prioritise any of those, our official country name is in Latin (confoederatio helvetica), which is why our country code is CH
We have four official languages, that‘a kind of unique
And then there‘s our infamous neutrality (this is an age old policy that states that Switzerland will not involve themselves in any armed conflict between other countries, it is still in place today) which is why we were very close to both world wars (Geographically, we’re between Germany and Italy, or Austria and France
Schaffhausen was even accidentally bombed by the allies during ww2) but were not directly involved in either
We have four official languages:  German, French, Italian and Rumantsch
Our political system is also pretty cool
Legislation is done on three different levels: federal, cantonal (our cantons are the equivalent of the American States, though they're not quite as large) and communal
Each level has its own legislative, executive and judiciary organ, and each level is responsible for different things
The federal parliament (let's not get into the others, shall we) has two chambers, very similar to those of the United States
The federal executive body is the Federal Council, which composes seven members that are elected yearly by the parliament
This forces members of very diverse political parties and opinions to find compromises, and the same thing is valid for members of Parliament, too, because there is no dominating party there; for a new law to be passed, it has to have the approval of several different political parties
And pretty much any major new piece of legislation is subject to a popular referendum, in which a majority of the population has to approve of the piece
In addition, the people can force parliament to pass a new piece of legislation through a popular initiative, which again has to be approved of through a referendum
All in all, the Swiss political system (at  least on the federal level) forces compromise between the major parties (we call the fact that the different parties rule together "Konkordanz")
Because a new piece of legislation requires the direct approval of several major parties and of the population, it usually takes years for a compromise to be found and approved of
The result is usually a solution no one likes but everyone can live with
The system works very well (though it is a little slow), but it only works because Switzerland is such a small country
If the interests involved were much larger and diverse, it would probably not work as well
i thought this was like the babyklappe which is
a different thing
I think the biggest thing that sets us apart is our form of democracy
Having 7 head of states, initiatives, petitions and beeing extremely federalist is really unique
I cant really find anything similar in Europe
Just as a sideinfo for all foreigners
We dont have a direct democracy
Its a semi-direct democracy since we still elect two chambers
Yeah, even as a native German speaker I will never ever not find noting numbers down difficult because of this
In spoken speech it is completely natural, but transcribing numbers does require more mental effort that Anglophones simply don't have
Your hand is moving against what your ears tells you you just heard, and it takes a few moments for the brain finally to intervene as the arbiter
If I am dictating my phone number, I always say all digits individually
I too thought the exact same thing
This right here
The right to start initiatives and petitions and practically propose laws or changes to law (on a constitutional level
) is not only unique but also leads to some funny situations in law
Our constitution (Schweizer Bundesverfassung) is a mix between human rights, what authority the "Bund" has, but also random things that got changed or added by the people who voted
Truee, I didn‘t even think of that:)
Long words are "unique" in the german language, but not Germany (Austria and Switzerland got that too)
And yes it is a real word
It means to deal or overcome ones history or past
(Vergangenheit = past, bewältigen = to overcome or cope with sth)
I honestly don't know any other languages that do this, but it doesn't seem to unlikely to me
After all it's not that crazy to put words together to make a new word
&#x200B;
If anyone knows another languge that does this I would really like to know about it
Ah yes that actually makes sense
It's the same for our swiss-germand dialect which sounds similiar to dutch at times
I kinda forgot about Dutch to be honest but I guess it shares a lot with german too
We don't have much of a music scene so the "popular" songs are going to be played to death for years to come
Most current one is probably still "079" by Lo & Leduc which came out in early 2018
Oh absolutely I love Faber, would have gone to his show in 2 months
But don't know how much he is actually played on the radio
Nice
I would say he's pretty popular, especially with the slightly ~alternative people (uni students) in all German speaking countries but again, not one to get blasted in stores haha
So I think he might be the most popular swiss musician right now, but "079" is just more universally known (and by now, hated
Ah yes sorry, I meant in Switzerland itself, don't think it was ever much of a thing elsewhere
Honestly same, so I wouldn't take my word on anything I said haha
Thurgau or Tessin
Romands and Thurgau
Yeah, but overall I'd say that Graubünden would be the "odd" canton
Well, that or Appenzell (both of them) :D
It’s from Germany but I need to share [this] It’s a beauty youtuber who tried to become a musician
I believe it’s in the top 10 most disliked YouTube videos
For Switzerland, [this] is a bad one
Especially if you consider that someone thought it would have a chance at the Eurovision Song Contest
0 points for that
Actually a fun song but it's been played to death by every radio station for the last two years now
My first boyfriend's parents even bought him a bigger bed, because he only had a small single bed
They had zero problems with me staying over
I even got my own key after a few months
And they were active church-goers and attended a bible study group etc
I've never quite understood what the problem is with my, or my partners, parents knowing what's going on
Why would that be an issue
The culture around Sex is just quite different here, much less 'prude' than in the US
Yup
My parents didn't care
When I brought a boyfriend home, it was clear he'd stay in my room, and it was obvious what might happen
There wasn't even any question about it
Americans have a really wierd relationship with sex
That's why I put prude in quotes, on the one hand they are an extremely sexualised society, on the otherhand they view Sex as something dirty and taboo
Maybe the word 'chlidish' is the better choice than 'prude' to describe the American mindset when it comes to sex
Or somewhere in between childish and prude I guess
At least that's consistent then
What utterly baffles me about the Americans is that they are so highly sexualised but still treat sex and nudity as a taboo
Having a Taboo and respecting that taboo makes sense, it's a mature thing to do
So is openly talking about things that aren't taboo
But pretending that something is taboo only to constantly break said taboo and giggle about it like a bunch teenagers is, well, immature (which is ok when you're a teenager but just seems silly when you're an adult)
I know it's not an agency, it's apolitical party; but in Switzerland, we have the "anti powerpoint party" as a real political party
We have a president
Sounds weird to list that here but there's a reason
The head of state is not one person but it's the Federal council, consisting of 7 members that have equal power
The president is just one of those, usually for one year and then they switch it up again
So the president is first among equals
The reason we have one is simply for representative causes, kinda hard to meet other presidents/leaders of other countries if they have to accommodate 7 of us
I don't think it is
Yes but it's not an important symbolism like the queen is for England
Pretty much only exists for convenience
9/10 people couldn't name our current president even if they had no trouble listing all 7 members of the council
Historically those paper formats where a DIN standard first
It was issued as DIN 476 in 1922 and adopted in 1975 as International Standard ISO 216
as far as I know, it's serious
It’s quite slow and kinda boring, but in a sense I find it very Swiss so I like it like that
The lyrics are also all like 'the sun is shining on the mountains and it’s a nice day'. Not epic or grandiose, but again very Swiss
To be honest, nobody knows it
You have it in like, four different languages, and people usually know two sentences and then just mumble the rest
I'd like to change it, but it's difficult seeing as it should include all regions
I think they tried to, but Switzerland being Switzerland, that didn't work
Stupid fun fact: people who want to be naturalized Swiss have to learn and know the whole thing
Swiss here, our national anthem's called Swiss Psalm and like the name indicates, its text is too religious in regards to how demographics have changed, at least in the German version
Most Swiss students learn at least their language region's version of it
I was fortunate enough to have grown up in a bilingual town and we learnt both the German and the French text
I definitely prefer the French text as it's more concerned with the beauty of the country and its mountains rather than to respect and fear God like the German text
There were attempts in the past to change the text in all four languages to a more neutral version, that is more representative of today's Switzerland, resulting in a now a still inofficial text that can be sung as an alternative
Yeah it’s not too bad but it would be nice if it was in swissgerman
I would say about 6 or 7 different kinds
I never really counted them though
never counted em, but at least 10 in a normal grocery store
probably around 5 in my local village shop
Also I think it depends on the time of the year
There’s usually at least some Golden, Gala and Pink Lady here at my local Coop, but the rest varies quite a bit
Boskop is also quite common
mmmmmm pink lady my favorite of them all
100% agree they're so good
A fondue or/and raclette set
I was specifically looking for this comment
Here in Switzerland too
When I visited Sweden last summer I brought back a swedish can of aromat as a souvenir
We call them Walkie Talkie here as well but i think Tratschi Watschi would be a way better name
We use a shit ton of diminutives which makes our entire language seem kind of childish
We generally use the diminutive -li a lot (Apfel = apple, Öpfeli = small apple), it makes things sound cute because you'd often talk to children with diminutives
one of the most common names for a swiss restaurant is Rössli, "Ross" = "horse" so "Rössli" basically means "horsey" which is a weird name for a Restaurant
Lol, my mom (Swiss) calls it "Füt-Füt". I've always felt a bit emberassed
There were these weird things called handy talkies
The Germans started using the word Handy for their mobile phones
The original handy talkies are now known as walkie talkies
Yes, we really do that a lot
I think it's interesting that sometimes it even sounds wrong if you don't use the diminutive
I would say "Chlämmerli" for clothespin, but never "Chlammere". Or "Wägeli" for shopping cart
In German, this is the sound of a rooster
Excellent
Makes sense
Why isn't it called "Verhü(e)terli"? It would make our language even more ridiculous
The Austrian diminutive -(e)rl isn't used that often, right
A year ago, I found out we don't speak the same language
We were in a small shop in Vienna and my mom didn't understand the word "Sackerl" (which is a cute Austrian word) and I had to translate it for her
Natel for me is like the old ones (not smartphones) and a word that I associate with our allemanic dialects rather than standard German
The word makes a bit more sense because you use the device for NAchrichten and TELefonieren
Prepare to be invaded, heretic
It's "Säckli". The word "Tüte" is forgein to us, just like many other German words
We use it neither for ice cream ("cornet", a French loanword) nor for marihuana (joint)
Right lol
Those ones that you had in your car if you were one of the very cool people
Not a native speaker, but I use "If I were
" instead of the incorrect but more common "If I was
Also I use whom, as in "asked by whom". This looks very outdated to native speakers but I can't help it because the distinctiom who/whom is very real to me
There is probably more
It's the same for Swiss German and Swiss standard German, which is mainly used in written form or in schools
In Swiss German, we put "the" in front of names, but that's wrong in Swiss standard German
In German countries we have coloured little cheap "reclam" books
Most are yellow, these are for I think mostly literature with open copy right (but not only)
Orange ones are in German and another language (left side italian, right side German), red ones are only in another language and the blue ones are for secondary literature about a work of literature
Very similar to bird language is the German "Löffelsprache" (spoon language)
Every vowel (including the Umlaute ä, ö and ü) gets doubled and you put a "lew" between them
So "a" becomes "**a**lew**a**", "ö" becomes "**ö**lew**ö**" and so on
"Das ist Löffelsprache" -> Dalewas ilewist Lölewöffelewelspralewachelewe
"This is spoon language" -> Thilewis ilewis spolewoolewon lalewangulewualewagelewe
Interesting
I have never heard of this before
It's not really as popular as it used to be, it was big with teenagers in the mid 2000's maybe
I thought the same, it reminded me of [this]
a bit off-topic, but I live in Japan at the moment, where one also drives on the left side of the road, usually people also walk on the left side past each other
It's not super strict though, and there are lots of places like train stations, where you walk on the right
The closest I can come up with would be the [Reisläufer]
I thought at the "Senn". They are kinda Cowboys in the alps, protecting their cows
But they even lived harsher lives than cowboys
One of them was Willheln Tell, who killed an evil tyrann
Fair, but I've never seen weapons being used as a defining characteristic of an Alpöhi or Senn
If I remember correctly "Wucher" doesn't apply to prices but interest rates
"Because I am not a fuckin' alcoholic" is an appropriate response to that
(I don't believe that having a single beer is alcoholism, but such a question from a waiter is highly inappropriate and deserves a response)
I'm not that experienced with german law, but we have something similar here in Switzerland too
(Art
20 [OR] and Art
21 [OR] Here it only applies if you sell the product to a higher price by abusing the other persons emergency or their
inexperience
I'm pretty sure you can choose whatever price you want if these don't apply
Maybe it's the same in Germany
I‘d say the education system in finnland
Ours is good but I heard finnlands is better
the prices from litterally any other country please it's like 3
50 for a coke here
Hungarian Beer
legal system from Norway
as well as the aspect of being situated in Scandinavia
I did BritRail last summer and it all worked out better than I expected
But yeah, I couldn't really go to rural areas because the way would have always been something like"5 changes, 30min waiting period each change"
Here you really can get pretty much anywhere with public transport but on the flip side it's expensive as fuck
We can trade bank accounts
I doubt that you have less
Wait
You don‘t take your shoes off when entering a house in germany
I assumed that would be similar to here
yeah but shit hella expensive here so id take prices from any other country
damn that’s long
here everything later than 1 minute is considered extremely late
Yes, that's why I had to skip Cornwall
I went to Brighton but I couldn't go further west from there because then the trains always would have gone back to London
i wish hahahah
Yess, I actually went with my parents when I was younger and we drove all the way from London to west end and back
I wanted to go again because it's really nice but I realised that it's not really possible with public transport
I couls get all the way from Oban to York in one day, so that was nice
We have a few here but it's more of a region tonregion thing so I say the ones for my canton, Valais : Wiliamine (pear liquor) and Abricotine (apricot liquor)
They both taste good and go really well with dessert
Well
Absinth was invented in Switzerland
But it's not a common thing we drink here
And in the east we have a herb liquor called Appenzeller that tastes a bit like Jagermeister
Limoncello is really amazing
Love that stuff ice cold in the summer heat
Yep, love these two ! In the Jura region Absinthe is also very popular
Yes but wouldn't damassine be the regional liquor of the Jura ?
Maybe for the Canton itself yeah, but I was thinking more of the whole of the Jura mountains, since I know absinthe is made in Neuchâtel but also in France
Ah yes makes sense then
For me, as a French speaker, I find it quite easy though I hate my accent and can’t seem to get rid of it ..
I've had English classes since 2nd grade and I'd say I've managed to pretty much be fluent by now
(end of high school)
English is one of the easiest languages to get on a (very) basic level of communication
You don't need to know as much of the language and its rules in order to be able to hold simple conversations like many other languages do
It's of course quite a different story when you want to obtain a higher, more eloquent level of it, then it isn't nearly as easy
I learnt both French and English in school as foreign languages
French started in 3rd grade and English in 7th
Within ~4 years, I spoke and understood English better than French, which I had at the time been learning for already 8 years, even though I lived in a part of my country that spoke French quite often
Today I speak and understand French well, but it's nowhere near my level of English that's quite close now to that of a native speaker
Using "was" instead of "were" in a hypothetical
r/shitamericanssay
It's was for something presumee true in the past and were for a hypothetical
For example:
I was just having dinner
Versus
If I were having dinner, I would be eating
It's fine, don't worry about it
There's the official website of SwissTopo [map
geo
admin
ch]
It's probably the most accurate maps of Switzerland out there (way better than google maps for example) , but it has no function to plan journeys or similar
It's more a geographical tool
&#x200B;
Edit: Yes, the Swiss government uses the domain [admin
ch] which I find kinda cool
For the federal level, there's the maps of [Swisstopo] that includes infrastructure information but also historical maps and satellite pictures
For the canton of Zurich, I know the [GIS browser] with detailed zone information
I guess all cantons must have something like this because building regulations go through this level
The city of Zurich has its own portal that includes a map from the 18th century: [Stadtplan]
I don't know what other people use but I use [map
search
ch] on my computer or the search
ch app on my phone
I also have Swisstopo on my phone but I don't use it too much because it uses a lot of mobile data afaik
These two are only for Switzerland
For Austria I use [basemap
at] I also use OpenStreetMap, though not that often
Lastly, I also use HereWeGo (former HereMaps) because it has a download feature so I can use maps offline
I only use the maps from the Swiss government for my planning of hikes, cross-country skiing, cycling, and snowshoeing: [Switzerland Mobility]
They are incredibly accurate, and you can also download sections of the map for off-line use
In addition, the tool allows you to create your own routes and download them on the GPS-tracked app, with very accurate distances and even timings
I use [Komoot] quite a bit for planning hiking, biking or photography trips
What they get right (that I miss in almost all other route planning applications) is that I can plan a route on the desktop, on my *big screen, with keyboard and mouse,* and later use it for turn-by-turn navigation via the mobile app
It's not free (except the first single region of your choice), but their pricing is really fair compared to all the yearly subscription bullshit you see nowadays: 30€ for the whole world
One time payment, lifetime updates
Well there is [basemap
at] in Austria
I usually use it when I'm in Austria
You could also try OpenStreetMap or HereWeGo which also has a download feature for offline use
Never gave the "admin
ch" much thought but it's definitly awesome
Oh wow, I’m surprised by the results from Northern Ireland
Reddit makes it sound like the only thing standing in the way of a united Ireland is England
But obviously there’s more to the story than that
1 CHF - nothing really, a (small) piece of candy maybe
10 CHF - a Sandwich
100 CHF - 4 - 5 medium sized pizzas (~32 cm) from my local delivery place (the cheapest Pizza at my local delivery guy is 18
50 CHF and the most expensive 30
00 CHF - including the delivery fee)
1 CHF = 0
91 Euro = 1
09 USD
CHF 1
-: about half a kilo to a kilo of carrots
CHF 10
-: 200g of a cut of beef (at most)
CHF 100
-: about a week worth of food for a two person household
1 chf - no weed
10 chf - 1 gram of weed
100 chf - 11 grams of weed
>1 packet ? (plastic jar
I think you're looking for "cup"
1Chf gets you roughly a liter of milk
You can also buy 6 liters of mineral water
Or a kilo of flour
1 CHF can still get you about a pound of basic vegetables (or), a cheap loaf of bread, or 1 kg of cheap rice
Also most (supermarket) sandwiches I've seen don't go over CHF 5
It would have to be a high quality sandwich
You can get a bottle of water/ ice tea for less than
1 CHF
or the cheapest 100g chocolate bar for
50 CHF
At Migros though
I assume you haven't ever been poor (for Swiss standards)
You can buy a lot more with 1 CHF than you think
further down the english n is for aNywhere like N-ywhere
So maybe they translated it to N-dlich
We learnt cursive writing in primary school, never used it in and after secondary
Print in 1st grade and cursive in 2nd if my memory still holds up
Printed from 4 to 8 years old then cursive
we learned the cursive script but I was never really good at it so I still use print
I remember the same but they changed it now to what they call a Basisschrift, I think - a mix between the two
The general world-wide rule applies:
If someone at a tourist attraction asks/wants/gives something from/to you, politely tell them to fuck off
I love iit, worst thing about living in Switzerland is that there's no good seafood :( if I'm on vacation somewhere even remotely close to an ocean, seafood is all I'm gonna have
Never had it but doesn't sound strange to me
Would definitely eat this
Bern: Everything is slow there
Zürich: Only Bankers, Coke and Hookers
Aargau: Bad drivers
Wallis: Drunk at every time of the day
Appenzell Innerrhoden
They have incest going on, didn't give women the right to vote until they were forced to let them vote by federal court until 1990
They are extremely conservative
Rental cars usually have a licence plate from AI, so if you see an AI licence plate it's most likely a rental car because there are not a lot of people who live there and I think they rarely leave
People from Zurich are considered arrogant, but I think that's just because the others are jealous
And then there are a lot of things like that about every region because everyone makes fun about each other
People from Schaffhausen, St
Gallen and Thurgau supposedly have a terrible dialect
And so on and so on and so on
I don't know what the non-German speaking parts of the country are up to though, we usually don't joke about those
Then there is Graubünden, which is the same thing again but smaller, one example is that they say that Surselva is the incest region
A friend od my dad once called it a developing region (Entwicklungsland)
Edit: oh and people from Bern speak very slowly and everything is just slower there, people walk slowly etc
Bern - the slow ones (and their versatile word äuä)
Zürich - rich snobs that do cocaine lol
Appenzell Innerrhoden / Ausserrohen - Incest
Graubünden - weed smokers and volvos (and accent)
Thurgau - their weird accent
Wallis - their not understandable accent
Aargau - not being able to drive and wearing white socks in sandals
We just meme the whole country
I have a winter house in Florida
I go there for a month or so a year
I'm fine with America, but I wouldn't want to actually live there in a permanent fashion
I think everything that has been written so far by others explain the reasons why I feel this way, so I will not bother typing them again
Are you asking long term or short term
From the comments you got I think most people thought you were asking long term
I've been spending a couple of months in the US every year for maybe 5 years now
My brother also did two semesters of high school in the US
If we are talking short term, yes I would happily spend a few months there
Not in the same general area like I do now tho, I would travel around
There are aspects of the US I really like
I'm interested in your culture and people, the landscape can be gorgeous, wide open spaces as far as the eye can see, amazing national parks, iconic architecture, a lot of variety, there's a lot to love
However, if we are talking long term, I'm not sure I'd be comfortable living there
I think I would have to lower my living standards if I was to survive there on my own
I want to leave home as soon as I turn 18 and without my parents' help I highly doubt I'd be able to afford health care in the US
And needing healthcare is not like a remote possibility for me
I need therapy, I'm on medication, need injections and to see a chiro regularly
I remember health isurance being annoying to sort out even back when my brother, who is healthy and not a mess like me, had to spend a year there
I'm no expert on this stuff but I do know my parents pay for global coverage and even for global there's two options: everywhere or everywhere + US
That should give you an idea of how expensive the US is in that regard
Apart from that, I like to walk and I use public transportation a lot
Having to drive constantly is not something I would enjoy
In fact, the few weeks per year we're in the US we're in Cali 80% of the time and the traffic kills me every time
I also think walking around is overall less safe in the US
At the same time I hate gated communities and the burbs
They can be nice and relaxing for a few days but by week 2 there's nothing left to do besides driving to the mall
Additionally, spending longer periods of time in the US I'd be slightly worried about:
- open carry / gun control in general
- shootings
- racial hate
Closest I've been to any of that was: spring break 2018 I was landing in LAX when the YouTube shooting was unfolding, walked next to a guy open carrying in a convenience store in Colorado, a few stupid arguments about race among teenagers
So, nothing major but just not stuff I would want long term in my life
No I wouldn't cuz you guys don't have healthcare
You tell me
There are a lot of regulations for non citizens to own property in the US, and also significant tax issues if you sell it and make a profit
I had an attorney associated with my Swiss bank assist in the documents and legal parts of things
I wouldn't even consider it without trusted local legal advice
I have insurance and a company that takes care of the place so they handle all the preparation of something like that is going to happen
Fondue
(Or raclette, but I mean, you don't have to wait and reflect on your life each time with a fondue, you can just eat and eat and eat)
älplermagronen, I could eat tonnes of that
potato, macaroni, cheese and sometimes sour cream mixed and baked
top with fried onions and optionally eat with apple sauce
I'm too lazy to make a fondue and stir it constantly
I just make microwave-raclette
It's much faster than a stupid raclette oven
Switzerland is officially called Confederatio Helvetica as to not put any of the 4 national languages into an advantage
The helvetia one makes a lot of sense because the latin name is confoederatio helvetica
It still is imprinted on our coins
Edit: typo
Yup
We have "Millionhair", "4 Haareszeiten" (4 Jahreszeiten = 4 seasons) or "Haarmonie" (Harmonie = harmony)
And those are just off the top of my head
Der Besuch der alten Dame maybe
Or Die Physiker
Definitely something by Dürrenmatt
hedgehogs and martins are all iv ever seen,switzerland
I am not such a fan because of many reasons listed above and below
First, Far to many brave workers have died, building stadiums that will be abandoned as soon as the tournament ends
Secondly, the overwhelming heat surely isn’t going to be ideal to play and I don’t think every player is going to find it "great", to play in such extreme heat
And, thirdly, in my perspective, it just won’t feel as great as let’s say Brazil, like it seems like money is what got Qatar to host this World Cup in the first place (even though that may not be true btw)
I don’t know, it just doesn’t feel right for it to be there
It bothers me a lot
Russia had at least a serious experience with football that can permit us to say "let's not talk politics", and they put everything in line for us not to be triggered with their normal political practices
But fuck: QATAR
Out of every arab-speaking countries that love football, we choose Qatar ? Slavery, air-conditionned stadiums ? Winter games ? They don't even have the population to fill thoses stadiums, what will they do, force indian workers to sit ? And what, with their expensives a-f prices and limitations on alcohol ? They will spend 100bl of dollars on this
This is ridiculous
Well
Here everything :
"le Saint-Empire romain germanique", meaning the Holy Germanic Roman Empire
“Between 1804 and 1806”, gotta love Napoleon :)
No, we don't have that for two reasons
Firstly, it's quite useless because average people usually don't use these made-up words (as you have pointed out yourself)
I think for most people, it just comes across as silly and patronizing
Secondly, Switzerland and also the German-speaking world as a whole (Germany, Austria) have quite a different approach to language than for example France
Politically, our countries are much more federalist and de-centralized and this attitude is mirrored in the way we treat/view language
Contrary to countries such as France which have a very prescriptive approach to their language, German-speaking countries tend to be much more descriptive
In Switzerland, for example, we don't even have an official standard
The diversity of local dialects is valued very highly and although some people find one dialect prettier than another, no dialect is considered "more important" or "more valuable" than another one
On public TV, for example, you will hear Swiss people from all regions with all kinds of dialects
In this context, English loanwords aren't viewed as a corruption of our language but more of a new addition
Swiss has countless of French loanwords and most Swiss people are proud of this rather than uncomfortable about it
The strong French influence is viewed as an unique trait of our language
But the times of Napoleon are gone and now English is the lingua franca, and that should be okay
On an emotional level, I understand people who want to preserve their language
However, linguistically this simply doesn't make any sense
Languages will always change and there's nothing we can do about it
As long as there will be cultural interactions between different countries and ethnicities, there will be linguistic change (and perhaps even without it)
Coming up with Korean or French words for English loanwords is like building a sand castle at the beach
No matter how beautiful you think it is, the next morning you return, it won't be there anymore
Thus, I think a better way of dealing with the situation is to embrace new loanwords in a creative way
For example in German, English loanwords are oftentimes conjugated as though they were regular German verbs
Sometimes, a loan expression is so thoroughly integrated into German that most native speakers don't even realize anymore that it was once "stolen". The same happened with words like "tea" from Chinese or "alcohol" from Arabic, which in the long run have made our language so much richer
Btw
: regarding North Korea's loan of "deutschland", I didn't know this but it makes a lot of sense given the close relationship
You probably know this but during the 1960s and 1970s, North Korea hired a lot of Germans from East Germany to help them with engineering etc
I wouldn't be surprised if more German loanwords could be found in the North Korean language/dialect
You folks need a word for a tank
> In Switzerland, for example, we don't even have an official standard
Isn't the [Swiss Standard German] an official standard
It doesn't invalidate your overall point, of course
In Polish there is a nice word for that: "gumiaki", which is native to the language
Unless you frown upon "guma" as a loanword, but that's kinda far-fetched
And samojed (self-eating)
Condone and condemn
I haven't actually mixed these up, but I still think you're asking for trouble having made these words so similar to each other ;-)
In German, it's also common to write words together but for some reason people seem to forget this and the result just looks atrocious
How can anyone in their right mind look at such an atrocity and not throw up
I mean, English has [arm ankles] so
Atm Alain Berset, minister of heakth, but only in memes
Not for everyone, but on the tabloid side of things Diana is held up as a saint far more than anyone else
This is the best one so far
It doesn't seem to be as common as in surrounding countries thankfully
I think it's partly due to our more consensus-based and restrained sociopolitical culture, which makes the opinion of experts still held in very high regard
But homeopathy (which is a legal scam that I can't believe it's available in every regular (!) apothecary, which means it should banned as false advertising because the market hasn't succeeded in relegating it into fringe mysticism areas where it could be maybe tolerated as placebo) is unfortunately common
Denials related to climate change are most common, mostly because accepting it would mean people have to change their habits
But they like driving their cars, eating lots of meat and flying to other continents, so they'll find excuses
Some will say yes climate change exists but it's not man made
Others will say well yes it exists but there's nothing we can do
Others again will say China, India and the USA should fix it, us being too small to make a difference
Some will say climate change exists but it's natural
I'd much rather these people just be honest and say yes, I'm helping making the planet unhospitable for humanity but my steak and my SUV are more important to me
Flat out denying the existence of climate change I've never encountered
I mean there are people who believe Bielefeld is real
I mean, pff, come on
it’s really sad how many europeans believe the earth is round when in fact it doesn’t even exist

Well, i mean, no
Cursing is way less funny in englidh than it is in swissgerman
Calling someone a "Hure Schofseggel" or a "Soudübbl" is way less offensive than english swears
Yes even speaking in "high german" makes me a little bit different then i usually am
I get a deeper more attractive voice somehow
I glaub des is bei fast jedem so :)

Some manual labor jobs in Switzerland can pay surprisingly well, even though they're generally considered working class jobs
For example I used to know a guy who works on construction sites
He began at the very bottom of the hierarchy and by age 25 or so he had worked himself up to become a foreman
Together with his compensations for lots of extra hours and occasional weekend work, he made over 8,000 Franks (€7,400), which is really good money for someone without any higher education
Zurich is even more exspensive than the rest of Switzerland, bad comparison imho
But generally you're right
Well, double prices are partially due to a really weak Euro
Exchange rate used to be around 1
65 chf per euro, now it’s almost 1:1
If you calculate prices in „average minuets you have to work to buy item x“ (ie local purchasing power) Switzerland/Swiss cities often top the list of most affordable places
Food and any services where you have to pay for someone with a Swiss salary (barber, cleaner and whatnot) are very expensive
But I‘m amazed how expensive something like an iPhone must be for our neighbors
Higher price due to VAT while they earn significantly less
Yeah that's about right
Subway, Burgerking or takeout pizza (turkish ones or dominos) are all about that price range
McDonald's a bit cheaper at about 15
Real italian takeout pizza about 25, depending on the location
Döner usually about 10
Our group of 4-5 ordering takeout for movie night is usually about 120
- and we don't order crazy expensive stuff
Local meat is pretty expensive but at least we have good conditions for the animals
Spotify is about 13
-/Month, Netflix 12-21 depending on which one
Beer is 6-8, coffee 3-5 depending on location
Zurich is expesnsive while more rural areas are usually cheaper (except from mountain regions of course)
Meanwhile electronics are the same if not cheaper than in Germany
Some cloths are really cheap
And if we go on vacation we're quite well off compared to the local economy as for us everything is cheap abroad
And Zurich is even more expensive
That’s also a consequence of a weak Euro combined with a strong Swiss franc
At its highest conversion used to be almost 1
70 CHF per euro, now it’s around 1
05 CHF per Euro
For some people cross border shopping is definitely part of their shopping routine, depends a bit on how close they live to the border and/or how much they value their time to drive across the border
In reality Switzerland became successful due to early industrialization and adaption of those early efforts to other industries
Switzerland had one of the highest/the highest GDP per capita by the end of the 19th century
Today, banking is just one of many fields, others include nutrition (nestle), pharmaceuticals (Roche, novartis), agricultural chemicals (syngenta), flavours and scents (givaudan, firmenich), engineering (abb) etc
Yes it's generally pretty nice to have it this way around
However, it also means that if you're out of a job you have to find more money than if you're out of a job in another country
And it also means that most online freelancing platforms / remote jobs abroad pay like shit
$7/h might be pretty ok if you live in Turkey but here it's just not worth it, as stupid as it sounds
But for those cases we have good social security I guess
I think it's about 1000 + apartment + health insurance
Apartment generally has to be as cheap as possible but they won't force you to instantly relocate, just as soon as possible
And you can get reduced fees for health insurance if you don't earn much
So the total amount varies (and I think they pay apt/Insurance directly)
And it really varies on location and is calculated individually but this is more or less considered to be the Existenzminimum (existance minimum)
If you're interested you can find more detailed lists of how that 1000 is coming together online
Edit: If you lose uour job you usually get 2 years of unemployment which is 80% of your former income
After that you get "Sozialhilfe" with the above mentioned stuff
You do have to pay that back (not the unemployment though) once you're earning enough again but, once again, this depends on location (gemeinde/canton)
Zürich: rich and expensive, the one big city of the country
Economical centre, night life, snobby people, the zoo
Geneva: also rich and expensive, diplomatic center , very international city, full of French, snobby people, protestantism and nuclear research
Bern: the capital, pretty old town, swimming in the river, the bears
Lausanne: pretty view of the Alps, the only underground of the country, Olympic capital, drug dealers everywhere
Basel: museums, convention centers
Luzern: tourist hub, nice old bridge
Zermatt: expensive ski station
Davos: expensive ski station
Gstaad: expensive ski station
Cran-Montana: expensive ski station
all I know about German cities is that Bielefeld isn't real
Zuerich: you can kinda smoke weed around and nobody is gonna bother stopping you
Bern: diplomats and politicians feeling lost among people who walk around like they just rollend out of bed
Up from murder capital
Congrats
I can confirm that we here in Zurich are all high
Makes the place more exciting
Hope it goes away from a political union to a solely economical one
So switzerland actually has any reason to join
Also the more countries leave the better for switzerland

Hmmm
Why is it that way
The name Silvan also originates from there even tho it spread a lot to the rest of the german speaking parts of switzerland
Neapolitans are really some very regional patriots and superstitious people
I heard a phrase that sums it up very well, "Napoli ain‘t Italy".
I grew up in Poland, I've been living in Switzerland for 10 years
As long as I am anywhere in Europe I am at home
I would prefer to be in European Union, but the preference is not strong enough to give ip my life in Switzerland

Happy cake day to you too
If you like big coins, let me introduce you to the swiss franc
there's this one channel that's an American living here with her Swiss husband and its funny for me to watch because they talk about things that are normal for me but not for her
I forgot her name though
I think you mean "How to Switzerland" if im not wrong
[This one I guess ?] The song could’ve still been okay if it wasn’t for her wrong notes and that terrible staging
I mean, it looks like she just really needs to pee and is trying to hold it in
Teenage life really is horrible to listen to
In my experience as a Swiss, I found Austrians more friendly and good-natured
Germans a bit more forceful and direct
Well Germans kinda have a hard time being proud of their history, even more so because they get shamed and denounced yearly
Wait, seriously
In english, no
In german we already to that
In German, we always said "Tschechien" rather than "Tschechische Republik". I then got used to "Czech Republic" in English but found it a bit weird
The name change seems logical to me because of that but for some reason I'm just struggling a bit when pronouncing "Czechia" in English
For sure Czechia, logical short name
And it sounds similar or identical in most of languages
Czech Republic sound beautiful to me
Czechia just doesn't sound right to me
We say République Tchèque in French, so I ise that version in English as well
Badass as the French Republic ;-)
It takes time to get used to it, I didn't like it, now I love it
[www
amazingczechia
com]
And the Czech Republic is being confused with the Chechen Republic
[Boston marathon bombing]
ČR is Čínská republika, Čečenská republika, Čuvačská republika, CR is Costa Rica
It's pronounced Čekija as in Lithuanian
My Slovak friends call it Česko
In Swiss German it's Tschechie and I have hated it in 1993, sounded like Asia to me
Today I use it exclusively
It's not a name change, but short name registration
You are not used to it
Give it ten more years
Czechoslovakia was called awful and ridiculous
The  Czech Republic can describe our country only after 1993
Formal name will never be a brand
CZECHIA is handy and easy to remember
The **short** (geographic) name of a country cannot be **substituted** by its formal (**political**) name, which is **transient** and **ignores** the **historic continuity** of a given state territory because it is limited only to the existing state form
While the Czech Republic has only **existed since 1993**, the Czech state has existed in various forms and under different political names for more than **one thousand year**s. As such, the political name can **never fully replace** a permanent geographic name that does not change in response to changing state forms in a particular territory
The need for a proper short name is demonstrated by the fact that the Czech Republic is often erroneously shortened to **Czech, Czech rep
or Czechrep, CR, C. Rep
Republic CZ or Czecho
** In many cases, foreigners continue to use the name **Czechoslovakia**, although the country has not existed since 1993
“Made in the Czech Republic” has failed to become a familiar brand around the world because it is ambiguous and too long
Cechia
Check out EU country list
We still use Tschechei here
Don't really have an alternative so not dated yet
It takes time to get used to it
I have hated the Swiss-German Tschechie, today I love it
I didn't like it as well, today I love it, and it sounds similar or identical in most other languages
Both equally i guess
Myself i use both completely randomly
It takes time, Czechoslovakia was called awful and ridiculous 4 years after its foundation
Check out Library of Congress archive , Czechia was used pretty often before WWII as the denomination of the western part of Czechoslovakia
Polish and Czech have been almost identical languages in the middle ages
Oh i didn‘t know that
Thanks for the info
National Geographic 1921, Karel and Josef Capek, 1922
No, very happy with Czechia ;-)
Česko
Böhmen=  Čechy,   Česko = Tschechien
Similar in Switzerland, older folks say Tschechei, younger Tschechien, btw, Tschechei is the same like Türkei od Slowakei, but was discredited by the usage of Nazis, it has a negative connotation
It Hitler would say Banana instead, Banana would be a bad word today
:;-)
The cantonal war flags of old all have that flamed pattern btw
You still see the Bernese one every now and again here
Not necessarily
Of course the German Reich was not really sympathetic to the democratic movements but that its flag got reappropriated by right-wing movements had more to do with a legal workaround
The original Nazi flags are banned in Germany, so they took the next best thing which were the German Reich flags
But hadn't more to do with the hope that the Nazis would reinstate the monarchy
I was more referring to the modern movements which don't have a particular monarchistic touch
The other dude explained how it is more about someone else's attention aka to lose *their attention*
It's not about fearing to lose anything but specifically the attention or love or favor of someone
Not only were you wrong but also unnecessarily cocky
Or can you give me just one single good reason why you reacted with this attitude
Tech/research/banking: Zürich
Diplomacy/banking: Geneva
Chemical/pharmaceutical: Basel
Sports/hospitality management: Lausanne
Geneva: commodity traders, diplomats, bankers, physics scientists, secondary school teachers
It is called the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine in official places like the Swiss public health agency, but in the press and common discussion it is also sometimes called the Pfizer vaccine
I suspect that is rather for brevity than the desire to transfer credit from one company or country to another
Just 5: German, French, Italian, Spanish and English
English, Deutsch, Schwiitzerdütsch, Suomi, Svenska, Norge, Dansk, Italiano, Français, Русский, Español, and others I don't remember
Yeah, Schwizerdütsch took “merci” from French, I’m not sure if I would count it as it’s exactly the same word
Maybe
I don’t care much, since it’s pronounced the same, and written swiss does not exist officially, so I suppose both would be valid ways to write it
I have only heard “merci” spoken, never written, so I really don’t know
I reckon most people know it as the U2 song without understanding the context/history of the song
Doubt the marketing team was mindful of this

Wow a top comment from switzerland

I actually couldn't believe it either when I looked it up
Thought it was released sometime around 2010-2011
It's crazy
We are the only European country (that I know of) that never had a native aristocracy during our independent period
I.e. there never were Swiss kings, dukes or counts (while we were Switzerland)
The closest you can get are the patricians that ruled the cities, but those can be regarded more as a mix between wealth and blood rather than purely blood
There is one notable exception though (which I am sure is a famous fact here): the one actually notable aristocratic house of Swiss origin are the Habsburgs
They pissed off to Austria though as soon as they got more sizeable lands outside their Swiss core
The loss of their ancestral castle to a bunch of peasant revolutionaries was a sore point for them during the medieval period
Well, our "national sports" (aka
traditional Swiss disciplines) are [Hornussen] [Schwingen] and [Steinstossen] Of the three my favorite to watch is Schwingen, but Hornussen as a team sport could also be a good choice
I saw someone else already mentioned it but I think Switzerland would also be able to compete in [Floorball] (yes Sweden and Finland are obviously the best but [we're holding up]
Eating cheese
or when you think of a real sport probably "Schwingen" or "Hornissen"
We used to play floorball a lot in school, it brings back memories ! Another swiss sport we would play was [Tchoukball] Apparently now Taiwan is the world leader, but I think we could still defend our colours pretty well
Cashier here
At our checkouts there are four scanners: one on the bottom, two on the side and one from the top (plus the hand scanner of course)
Most products have multiple barcodes
The scanners can read the barcodes near-instantly, as long as it isn't obstruced, damaged or folded (Looking at you, fruits & vegetables section)
We can also make it so that the next scanned barcode will ve added X amount of times (Number plus "amount" button, then grab 'em all and pull 'em over)
I also like to spin the product a little, so that more surface is visible to the scanners
In conclousion; the chackouts are stupidly optimised and you can go crazy fast if you do it right
Yeah, it happens a lot that two customers are still packing up and I'm left building a tower of products from the third, but I haven't gotten an unlucky streak yet where people have to wait because of it
Depends
If it 20
85 for example and they give me a twenty and some change then I'm glad they do it
But if it's like 1
25 and they hand me a 100
- why not even paying attention to me (these go hand in hand most of the time) then I'm a little annoyed, but I've gotten desensitized
The Anti-PowerPoint Party is a political party whose goal it is to stop the use of PowerPoint and other presentation programs because they allegedly cause economic damage to our nation

"in power" would be contradictory to half of their name
Bulgaria, everything below that is medium or small
Norway/Sweden/Finland
their population isn't huge but they've got quite some territory
Geographically I would say Iran is the first country that makes the jump above medium-sized
Pop-wise I would say >50 mil is "big", so anything a bit more populous than Spain
Area
Of course
Do we
I’ve seen family zones, but I don’t recall any "quiet zone"
Only in first class wagons
I was just thinking that I haven't seen one in a long time
Maybe because people tend to be quiet anyway unless it's the family zone
I guess that explains why I've never noticed =/
I've seen the family cars though
I imagine that is its own special level of hell
Aren’t first class already the quiet wagons
No, they are their own thing:
I'm from Basel, which I love, but I also really love Berne, it's so pretty and the whole vibe there is great
it's hard to choose, Luzern is pretty, but very touristic
As is lugano
Zurich is quite nice too
I haven't been in Geneva or lausanne
I probably have to say Poschiavo and its surrounding villages
such a pretty and remote part of switzerland
I'm not going to say mine (Geneva) because that would be lame, so I'll say my second favourite city, which is Lugano in canton Ticino
Bern
I enjoy that city so much each time I visit
The deep river valley cutting across the city is so beautiful
Sadly I only know train stations in Basel
the traffic is usually bad around Zurich, because nobody drives into Zurich cause they know that that'd cause traffic
There is r/BUENZLI which is kinda funny and nearly exclusively Swiss German but I think that's it
I don't have Instagram so I don't know what is going on there
Oh nice I was looking for ways to relearn german, memes might motivate me
Gondola was created by an Italian dude
It's based off spurdo, yes, like spurdo was based on pedobear who was based on kuma bear
I'm subbed to a lot of subreddits, especially a lot of random ones like r/BreadStapledToTrees
The problem with that is that generally the wierd things are very American
Someone once drew a snoo at their school and other people found it and posted it
Here, very few use Reddit
That would never happen here
Jungfraujoch (glacier saddle in the Swiss Alps)
If I had known how expensive that is I probably would have appreciated it a bit more
That guy's funny, dank je wel for the link
I didn't even think about the train all the way from Interlaken
We hiked up to Kleine Scheidegg with school and only took the Jungfraubahn
Because it isn't a school trip in Switzerland without hiking
There‘s sex ed in primary (6th grade), in middle school (8th grade) and also in universities sometimes
school of course
but I also asked my parents about it before that
My parents never had any "talk" with me, I learned it mostly from school and porn
Here it was also done in 4th and during Gymnasium too
They‘re about 12 y/o, so thats ok i think
Thats when they start puberty
It‘s not just sex ed, but more like „becoming and adult“ where they also talk about how boys and girls work
If your Swiss, catholic, unmarried and finished recruit school you can serve in the Vatican "army" (a.k.a. the Swiss Guard)
Even thought Switzerland was never a catholic only country (currently 26% protestant), your not allowed to fight for another country (unless you have two passports) and Switzerland is  neutral
Beside that Switzerland also protects Liechtenstein, but with the regular army
Not really a relation, but there’s a weirdly high number of occurrences where Switzerland has accidentally invaded or attacked Lichtenstein
This occurred mostly because there aren’t much bordermarkings
Switzerlands militia trains a lot in regular civilian territory so a few times groups of soldiers walked over the border without noticing
I think they are really used to it by now and we have a deal to protect them anyway, so not much harm done, except for that time when we shot some rockets at them
(Gonna put some links down later if anyone is interested)
Edit:
Kim Jong-Un went to school in Bern and apparently he can speak Swiss German
Do you mean Berne instead of Zurich
[Obligatory Tom Scott video]
I'm half German swiss and half italian
I love both countries and before Covid I used to cross borders quite often
I gladly accept both identities, when It comes to behaviour I'm more italian but when It comes to politics I'm definetely Swiss
Let's just say I'm 60% italian and 40% Swiss
The fact that Swiss identity isn't really tied to language and ethnicity helps a lot
Born and raised in Switzerland
My father is german and my mom is half swiss and half norwegian
I never felt any connection to germany even tho technically im mostly german and i have been there a lot of times
Im more interested about my norwegian part
I also started leatning norwegian and hopefully i can go visit Norway this summer
I don‘t know if this counts but at the Vienna Congress of 1815, the great powers of Europe declared Switzerland a neutral country and it has defined who we are and kept us out of all the following wars, at least militarily
Yes they still lost, but damn did the soviets fuck up their attack thus making them look crazy weak
I think in general languages here are taught in ways that hardly reflects how people actually speak
During highschool we studied german by reading old poetry
I can still say the whole Erlkönig by Goethe, but it has hardly ever been useful
This turned a bit into a critique of how languages are taught in general, but for both english, german and french i got out of school unable to say much and had to learn them by myself
Well, basically all of my French
8 years in school, no chance I can follow a conversation or participate
All the crazy grammar we learned and in the end the French don't even use it
At least for Japanese you can apply it 1:1 and the only disconnects I had in English was due to British-American differences
Ye i'm from the deep south, our german was taught almost exclusively via poetry and history (we read a lot about Wikinger and ancient german paganism)
Moreover, it was hochdeutsch so it ended up being nearly useless in Switzerland
I guess it depends heavily on your country's size and population density
Since Switzerland is so small you can always get to the nearest city pretty quick, so we don't really have a "middle of nowhere".
I would say somewhere around the Alps maybe
Aargau/Thurgau
Derborence in the canton of Valais, or Lauwil in the canton of Basel-land
There are many
And also St
Urban, canton of Lucerne
Have you ever heard of derborence vs or lauwil bl
They are pretty far off
Derborence has a Postauto (modern version of the stagecoach) four times a day (twice in the morning and twice in the evening)
It's the opposite for me, I really want to visit the countryside and just walk through small villages in England haha
The pattern in Switzerland seems to be that young people (in their twenties) move to the cities to study or work, but young families (aka
People in their thirties) move out of the cities to give their children a nicer environment to grow up in
Because we've got a decent public transport network it's usually not a problem to live in small, rural towns and commute into the city for work
Also, in most of Switzerland, a small village is like a 20min car drive from the nearest city, maximum
There’s obviously the signs around train tracks warning you of a danger of death, usually looking like [this] and there’s also the 'danger of avalanche' [signs]
Not really popular at all
The most popular is clearly football with ski, hockey and tennis (because of Federer) following
And yet funnily enough, gymnastics is the sport with the most active members
I think that even though it has the most members, it is less well known or popular because it is not talked about in the media
That's just my guess
I also knew a lot of people who did downhill mountain bike and even more who did athletics (athlétisme, I don't know if my translation is correct)
Milk yes, it goes in the fridge
Eggs no, they stay on the counter
Cold milk tastes good
You guys are missing on lactose-free milk though
It is sweeter
I use what we call a Swiss layout
It has the Z and Y swapped in location like a German and Austrian keyboard, but also has extra keys to allow one to have fast access for French, Italian and Swiss German special characters/accents
On some these are accessed via function/option key, but I prefer a larger format where they are individual buttons
Most Swiss keyboards do not have a key for ß, as we don't really use this, but some have it on there anyway
Like pretty much everyone in Switzerland, I use the standard Swiss keyboard, a QWERTZ layout
The layout is standardised over the entire country which means it has to work for all four languages
On your computer, you can either choose German (CH) or French (CH)
This only affects the three keys for Umlaute and accented letters: in the German setting, they write ä, ö and ü, in the French setting they write à, é and è. If you want to use the ones not corresponding to the chosen layout, press shift
For the capital variants, you either have to use caps lock or accent keys
For other letters with accents (most commonly used in Italian) also use accent keys
The ç is shift+4, for Ç you need an alt-code though
The Swiss keyboard isn't suitable for Germany and Austria because you can't type ß with it
Personally I mostly use the German variant of the Swiss layout, but I switch to the French one for typing in French
(I also used to write French with the keyboard from France (an AZERTY-keyboard) when I was bored in typing class
Don't you have an accent key on your keyboard
Then you could press that button first and then just type E. The Swiss keyboard for example has several accent keys
I concur, I tried typing on a french keyboard once, and never again
Ah, I remember seeing the name Lugdunum in the Asterix comics but never really realized that it’s latin for Lyon
That the Swiss are bat shit crazy about "privacy" but are completely fine disclosing everything under the sun to rent an apartment
Like bank statements, salary slips, passport/personal ID's, permits, etc
I've even heard of people submitting medical notices/ultrasounds in order to gain an "advantage".
"Grand" is such an Irish word to use like that in normal conversation, isn't it
It's common courtesy to bring something or at least offer to bring something
But yeah, once at a party every drink is open for all
A few others
Inviting someone over to their place during dinner time and only offering a bread, cheese, veggie platter
In the cultures I'm from that's generally a no-no and you should provide them a full meal
Hard to describe
It'd be one thing to submit these directly to the landlord/regie themselves
But a lot of times the regie requires the current tenant to collect the dossiers (documents) on behalf of them
I collected about 12 dossiers when moving out of my apartment (housing is insanely competitive in Geneva)
Had around 4 bankers apply (they didn't get the apartment by the way - which confirms the fact that it's not just about money)
They make ridiculous amounts of money by the way
Not in the U.S. And why it was common (in University) to crash a party and leave as soon as the keg was tapped/alcohol was done
Frats or people took great pride and making sure this doesn't happen and why there are times during the party when people are asked to contribute/or to do a "beer run". Which can be an adventure of it's own
Yeah
that's not cool with me
Too complicated to write out but the rules around watch manufacturers being able to claim a watch is "Swiss Made" is basically a lesson on loopholes that is constantly being changed
It is possible to 'sit out' your personal debt in prison
My brother is doing this annually, running up fare dodging fees from public transport and other little tickets, then going to prison for two or three weeks
And then, when he's released, they give him a train ticket for the day
(I do not condone this behavior, but - alas
- it is lawful and he obviously has more time than money
That went through
In Switzerland supermarkets weren't allowed to sell products (toys, clothing, etc) of stores that were shutdown
They were covered in plastic wrap or moved to a section with no access
Article 2 makes me sad
:( Erdogan isnt half the man Atatürk was
>60 percent of the value of timepieces needs to come from Switzerland for them to gain the title, up from 50 percent previously
>The new rules have loopholes as they allow watchmakers to include research and labor costs in their calculations
Meylan said that Moser could legally use the label by building a watch with Asian parts and adding just one metal plate in Switzerland that gets polished in a Swiss workshop for 10 hours
Well, admittedly, he's been in an addiction-based downward spiral for a decade now and has nothing to lose in terms of reputation or employment
So I guess he does it to have an option whenever he needs medical attention or a warm, safe place to stay (plus getting around without having to pay
It's not a dumb move, all things considered
Du bisch mis Härzchläppertäschli
Tiens, je cherchais justement un commentaire comme ça
German speaking swiss are basically constantly mocking each other for their different dialects
In the french speaking part there are different accents, but they’re seen as a very rural thing because they’re getting more and more lost in the larger cities
I think most people would notice it, but not really care about it that much
Might crack a joke about it, but I don’t think it’s seen as lower class or uneducated, for example many local politicians have an accent
Heavy accents are parodied a lot in media, to make a character more swiss sounding
At least in French speaking Switzerland, there's a whole part of humor based on other accents
I'd say that for a "television neutral" (which is just Geneva) accent, Valais is the land of Christian Constantin and drunk people, Fribourg is the land of the farmers, Vaud is kinda lost, Neuchâtel mainly doesn't exist and the Jura is the land of dumb people
But it's pretty easy to guess where the person is coming from based on their accent
Same here
Everyone understands (almost) every dialect, changing yours is almost seen as a sign of a weak character
Well, from what I've seen, France usually has a bad relationship with accents and foreign languages
For example, in high schools, speaking English, you're teased if your accent is "too good" because you're a show off
But I think the biggest barrier is just French people against themselves
Parisians despise everyone who's not having a Parisian accent, and the rest of France is just making fun of Parisians lol
Quick interested question: what do you mean by "kinda gay"?
Reddit is so interesting, I've never heard of that being the case for Switzerland
Maybe it depends on the assumed prestige of one's dialect, as well as if both parents are from the same region
Where did you grew up
For context, I grew up in the canton of Argovia, and almost my complete social circle has parents from different regions of Switzerland (or other countries)
Over the years, most moved to other places (mostly Zurich, Berne, and Basel), and almost everyone has taken up at least some local dialect, and lost some aspects of their original dialect
While it sometimes get commented upon, it's seems to be neutral or positive (esp
in the case of the ones picking up the Bernese dialect)
Wasn't aware that some people might judge it negatively
If you're talking about Swiss German, I always heard that every canton had its own dialect that was different and hard to understand if you're not from the same canton
At least that's what people from Fribourg complain about, and my grandmother always told me she was kind of being joked at first about her accent when she was working in Bern
I grew up in Bern
I think Argovia might be a special case because it‘s like a melting pot in the middle
Every canton does have its own dialect, but we all understand each other
Minor exceptions
that's normal, even now
It would he a shame for Freiburgisch-Bernische relations to not mock one another all the time
That makes sense, in my high school class only two students had a proper local dialect, and it was pretty distinct
Minor exceptions: valais
I think people who are eating alone might feel self concious, but no one who sees you alone actually cares
It’s pretty normal, especially during the day if you’re working/studying and just want to sit and eat without bother
[Malakoff] fried cheese ball; "[tree frogs] a type of cabbage roll; [capuns] also a roll but with chard; "[Spanish buns] a special pasty, which even most Swiss/locals forgot about
> Sahne Hering
Basically pickled herring in cream
They sell these in Swiss-Supermarkets
I think there are also small bits of apples & onions in the cream
The spanish buns have quite the fun history though
Rich people in Zürich really liked those for breakfast
They were made only in Baden (25km away) as it's a local specialty
The first railway line in Switzerland was built and connected those two cities
As it was very often used to bring back those spanish buns (spanisch brötli) this line was called the spanisch-brötli-bahn
It's not in service anymore, of course, but they bring out the old locomotive and wagons for the local festival in Baden every few years
Yes, but it’s even funnier considering that the buns originated from Milano in Italy, which was under Spanish rule at the time
Oh nice didn't know that
We have 12, 9 of them cultural sites and 3 natural sites
[Wikipedia has a list of all of them
Switzerland has nine world cultural heritage sites and three world natural heritage sites [
(Four of those are multinational)
Also we have 6 entries on the lists of intangible cultural heritage [
Two of those are buildings designed by Le Corbusier
But in total, [seventeen sites] of his creation are registered as World Heritage sites, across seven countries
Truly a cultural giant
Huh, I had no idea I live in a World Heritage Site (Lavaux)
I mean I guess it's nice here
Have you never seen the Unesco signs
I know there’s one when entering Lutry from Paudex, I think there’s some on the A1 too
We have two words for „butter“, on one side we have team „butter“ and on the other side team „anke“. I have no idea wether it‘s a regional thing or completely random
As a foreigner, I think scone(bone) sounds way posher
I can more readily imagine a country farmer saying scone(gone)
"Not to be Confused With Sweden"
Helvetica instead of Switzerland
No confusion with Sweden and the abbreviation CH (confoederatio helvetica) will make more sense
Plus the national personalisation, Helvetia, makes sense
I mean, our official name is "confoederatio Helvetica" as to not favour any of the 4 main languages, but I think it's best if every country just calls it what it's called in their language, so "Swiss confederation" or just "Switzerland" in English
although, you could argue that the name "Swiss" comes from only one of the founding regions so perhaps, one should call it Helvetia to generalise, but then again, Helvetia reminds of the historical Helvetic Republic, a puppet of France
Confederacy of Helvetica
Sounds A LOT cooler than Switzerland
Schweiz or Suisse/Swiss
Switzerland is long and complicated for me
Personally id change it to Swizzy as my UK mate always calls it
I'm in Spain without the S
100% this would be used differnetly outside of romania
I actually find "Realm" a more badass translation
I don't know why, maybe because it's much rarer to hear and because it sounds more fantasy
"Eastern Empire" sounds tryhard
>Türkeli
I just wanna say that that would mean a small cute Turk in swiss german and i love it
We use -li when something is small or cute
Funny how different languages can be
I think Klytaimnestra is a very cool name but nobody can pronounce that
I mean that's just a huge generalization, some people wear clothing with logos on them (Adidas, Nike, GAP, North Face, whatever), others don't.
It's not something that you could say is "typically European".
Yeah, they are around
I have a rain jacket
Wait, every french family has its own washing machine and dryer
I also found Belgian beer delicious
Then I looked at the ingredients: They add fucking sugar to their beer, of course it tastes great
Yeah, gotta come to Switzerland for the good stuff
> Are the apartments too small
Mostly yes
Even in appartment buildings
20 washing machines for 20 appartments
We have shared washing machines and dryers in the basement of most appartment buildings
Single Houses obviously have their own washing machine and dryer
I wonder if it has something to do with Saxon heritage as it's also really prevalent in Northern Germany
Never realized that sharing those is something special and I dont really see a problem with it
They are often better than what you would get for yourself and they are literally one of the cleanest thing you could share with someone
Well in some appartment buildings the tenants do have their own mashines, but if they dont a so called "washing plan" gets established
Every appartment gets minimum one time slot per week and if you want to wash outside of our your assigned hours you just have to ask your neighbours who are assigned the time slot if you can wash your clothes
You can of course wash "rogue" but it generally gets frowned upon
I am baffled how this is not standard
An apartment building with 4 washing machines and two tumblers is entirely sufficient for everyone
Well to be fair, its often not single washing machine
Its often several machines in one room
Well, so far ive only had good experiences
> but also in houses
Where would be the washing machine be for these houses
It keeps you fit at the very least
The only annoying thing is when people use it for convinience (i do that myself)
E.g. in the militairy the french speaking soldiers and the german speaking soldiers sometimes speak english with each other because their german/french is really bad
Same goes for the italian speaking soldiers
I think we shouldn't stop learning each others language just because it's easier
Well I would prefer if we had our own european lingua franca, and not american english
Germany: No
France: No
Austria: No
Liechtenstein: The fuck are they gonna do, they even borrow our military lmao
Italy: No
We're Europe's bunker
Neutral Switzerland ftw
not a personal opinion, but many Swiss conservatives are resentful towards the country respective to their language
in the German speaking part a lot of people are saying that the Germans are "invading" us and taking our jobs, in the Italian parts it's the same
I'm not as sure about the French part though
hey man something is wrong with your keyboard
fix that pls
Never forget the time we accidentaly "invaded" Liechtenstein
And we got our big, strong, skilled army
Does that make us the biggest threat to Liechtenstein ?
yees, very strong and very skilled, some smart people say it's the best army, very smart people believe me, maybe the smartest, who knows
how are they even scared of you
I can speak Romansh as my mother is from a part of Switzerland where this is spoken
I learned it as a kid
I use it sometimes when I visit relatives there, but it is not something I do regularly
Surveys by the government I have seen estimate around 35,000 speakers who use this as their main language, and another 60,000 or so that can speak it
In some towns in Switzerland, it is the official language and used in schools, government, and in every aspect of daily life, although Swiss German usually is used in parallel
Romansh is listed as a Swiss national language, and therefore has legal status and some protections
Switzerland has four national languages: German, French, Italian and Romansh
Of these, I speak German and French
I don't speak Italian but I understand some stuff when I can read it because I had to learn Classical Latin at university
I’ve only been in the Rumantsch speaking region once, but it really made me want to know more about it, and maybe even someday learn it
I think it’s  a shame it’s being kinda forgotten here in the Romandie region,
Switzerland is a subject nation under the EU, and there is nothing we could change about it
That we are an EU state in all but name
There's a constantly used expression that we are "an EU member without any say", because in most legislations (the few that are actually better than existing Swiss laws
Typically we have higher standards than the EU, with only a few "downgrades" which lead to heated debates, like the recent EU automatic gun law) we either voluntarily just follow the big market around us anyway, or are forced because of existing bilateral treaties
We are mainly not in the EU for cultural reasons rather than political considerations
They just go there and put it on the side of the road
I didn't know this is a thing
I would like to apologize on the behalf of the Swiss
I guess that happens because there is a small fee on the trash bags in most Cantons, and some unintelligent people thought they could save a few bucks
It has been reported in quite a few newspapers in Switzerland to draw attention to the unacceptable behavior of these people
Canton Geneva apparently decided to not put any fee on the bags, which made some people in France happy
Switzerland produces around \~90000000 tons of trash per year, and 10 tons of them apparently appear illegally in France, which is definitely 10 tons too much :-(.
It may seem a bit mean, but I think in Switzerland people mainly think of North Africa as cheap tourist destinations (Especially Egypt, Tunesia and Morocco) .
Not necessarily exotic, but almost always warm and sunny, with beaches and the sea etc
Not that much farther than Southern Europe but much cheaper
Edit: Typo
I learned quite a few things about the history (i. e. ancient times until the collapse of the roman empire) but I don't really know what's going on there right now
I kinda know who was colonised by who but that's about as far as it goes
I also know that everyone there speaks different dialects of Arabic and that sometimes people from regions that are far away from each other sometimes struggle when they have to communicate
I also know the names of the countries I can find there (and I think the situation in Lybia still isn't nice, there's some sort of power dispute going on there between different groups who say they're the rightful government
), so it's not a lot but luckily not just nothing
WWII so you can run around the thousands of underground bunkers and tunnels in the alps, see innocent looking chalets split open to reveal giant artillery guns, airplanes fly out of hidden underground airports
All this whilst making sure the axis powers stay out of the country
Old confederacy so (1300 onward) or the high time of swiss mercenarys (late middleage)
Arround the 14th or 15th century when Switzerland became itself and we had a strong arm, with halberds
Frontaliers
I never heard this but it's kinda funny
Like Germans are all Piefkes in Austria
Not sure about the 70's but in the 80's in the French speaking part of the country French music was popular
(Partenaire particulier, les démons de minuit, etc
) But music from the UK and USA was also very popular
**German:** Fluent, no problems
**Dutch:** When it's written down I understand about 90%. When it's spoken and I'm well-informed on the topic, I understand about 70%. I once watched a Dutch documentary about Mallorca and I was surprised by how much I was able to understand
Once I get into it, it's a bit like a distant Swiss dialect
**Swedish:** I once took some Swedish language classes for fun
I'm able to understand about 60% when it's written down
Enough to comprehend a newspaper article about a simple topic (say, a crime)
Spoken it's much more difficult
**Danish and Norwegian:** Similar to Swedish but a bit harder to understand
**Icelandic:** Don't understand anything
***Honorable mentions:***
**Old English:** I'm able to read it with the help of a dictionary
I had to learn it during my studies as an English major in university
Part of the final exam included me translating a passage from an Old English text I had never seen before
I'm now a bit rusty on the highly complex grammar though
**Middle English:** Also had to learn it in my studies
This one is much easier to understand
It's somewhere on the level of Dutch
A bit hard to get into but once I'm in there, it actually flows quite smoothly
Some writers are also easier than others
Chaucer is generally quite easy to understand and his stories are also fun to read
Although we basicly speak the same accent, Germans don't understand us very well
But this also depends on where you grew up in Switzerland
We do understand all kinds of German pretty well
As for whole different languages, it's pretty much the same for Dutch and the Scandinavian Languages
I do understand some phrases and words but mostly not a whole conversation
We understand the Germans but they don't understand us
By speaking English and a bit of German, I can grasp a few words in Dutch and Danish
As a French speaker, I picked up Spanish pretty easily while at school, dunno if French had to do with it
I pick up some words in Italian too
I suppose I could guess what a sentence in these languages means (ish)
Pretty good if its a language i never learned
And all those i did learn were very easy to learn
I watch some dutch YouTube videos every once in a while, it really depends on how fast they are speaking but usually I can pick up the key words to the conversation and can follow it more or less
Okay there we go lol
Swiss German: dialect from Zurich is my native language
I can also speak the dialect from Schaffhausen, but I rarely use it
Speaking to people with other dialects work fine, but I sometimes have to ask for clarification with certain words, but that's quite rare
Standard German: Is how we write and our language of education so I can understand and speak it
Austro-Bavarian German: I'm capable of understanding it and can even speak it to some extent but vocabulary is different sometimes
Other dialects from Germany: I generally understand them but some are kinda hard vocabulary-wise and sometimes even regarding pronunciation
Yiddish: When someone is speaking Yiddish, I sometimes understand several sentences in a row but then there are also sections where I understand barely anything
The pronunciation is quite different but that's not a problem for me, vocabulary can differ greatly (semitic and slavic influence), which is why I sometimes can't understand, the grammar is less complicated than in standard German
I can't read it because they use the Hebrew alphabet
Those were all High-Germanic-languages that came to mind, now continuing with Low-German or whatever it's called in English
English: I speak English as a second language
Scots: I can understand it (mostly) and try to use it when I need to sound angry
Jamaican Patois: Is quite difficult sometimes
AAVE (African-American vernacular English): fine
Singlish: I need to focus a bit more on the speaker but it generally works
I can even copy it to some extent
If they use loanwords I don't know I'm of course lost
Dutch/Flemish: I might understand individual words but I find it very hard to follow
Luxembourgish: same as Dutch and Flemish, maybe slightly easier
Danish: can't tell, please remove potato from mouth when speaking
Other germanic languages from Scandinavia: might understand individual words but is generally impossible to follow
Did I forget anything
Now for the romance languages
French: is my third language, that's why I'm even writing about romance languages
Italian: I might understand what you're trying to tell me if you speak slowly but I won't be able to respond
I might understand some written Italian but not a lot
My Latin is kinda helpful here though
Rätorromanisch (what's the English name for it
): depends on the local idiom, I might understand a little bit
Writing similar to Italian, Latin is also helping here
Other romance languages: little to nothing
90-95% written Schwiizerdütsch
What
Where do you find written Swiss German
r/BUENZLI or something
Kitchen related things are different here too, we have other ideas on what a "Pfanne" exactly is
To us, it's not just a frying pan
Why were they writing Swiss German when chatting with a forgeiner
Strange
Crossbow
Nah I'd say *damnatio ad bestias* ftw
Assisted suicide
Yes or fondue poisoning
My Alma Mater has a statue of William the Silent on campus
>Rutgers students affectionately call the statue "Willie the Silent" and "Still Bill
" According to student tradition, the statue is expected to whistle should a virgin happen to walk by
However, Rutgers American studies professor and folklorist Angus Kress Gillespie remarked "But over the last 200 years, he hasn't yet whistled
It is called Slutgers after all
Well we have 4 official languages (english isn’t one)
After the 5th grade you have english, french and german in school
I also talk a diffrent language at home
So basically I grew up quadrilingual (swiss german excluded)
Suprisingly not at all
But there are possibilities to do it but on the standard path there is none
At least in a place where one language has a clear majority
In the bilingual cities its normal
We have to learn at least one other language, but whe don‘t have obligatory subjects in different languages in the normal schools
we have immersive education in secondary school: the science subjects and some others (depending on the school) are taught in English instead of German
Sidenote: u/the-fim 's comment is worded a bit unclear
We don't have classes in other languages early on (normally)
Earliest I know of is English in "Gymnasium" level
You start learning English in 2nd grafe in most places
In 5th grade you'll start learning one of three languages (german, french or italian) since they are the biggest official languages
So at that point you'll have 3 languages in school (your first language, english and another official language of Switzerland depending on your location and your first language)
So e.g. me who lives in Zürich started German from the start, English in 2nd grade and French in 5th grade since it's the 2nd most popular language in Switzerland and Zürich isn't located next to an Italian-speaking area
Im general I would say this works quite well
One thing I noticed though is that the younger generations speak English a lot better than their 2nd official language and often use it to communicate with eachother over french/german
Here in Zürich I had the option to choose between English or German in the Gymnasium
for a nation that has spent most of its history at war with itself, I hear surprisingly little on separatism nowadays
Our separatists just want to be their own Canton (state) or switch Cantons
No one wants to leave Switzerland, just be included in a slightly different part of Switzerland
There are many in french, we have for example 'race' for race and breed, 'fleurir' for flourish and bloom, 'cuire' for cook and bake, 'fouet' for whip and whisk, 'plier' for fold and bend, 'aimer' for like and love
> Foot and leg are both jalka
This is so weird, it's the same in Japanese and apparently in many languages
How would you say e.g. to a doctor "I stabbed my foot" which sounds much milder than "I stabbed my leg"? If you say "I find legs sexy" do people assume you are a foot fetishist
Most Swiss identify with their town, then their canton, and then nation
I think this is a direct consequence of the history of confederation with the power distributed more regionally than with a strong central government
much more with my region which is also transnational
I identify with Switzerland the most but I also feel like I identify with Europe as a whole
Not as much as it was in history
Modern Switzerland has a central federal government with much more power than in the earlier takes on the confederation
It is pretty much a necessity in a modern world
Single currency, single foreign policy, single trade deals, standard common laws, etc
Still, even with the modern federal government, during normal times much of the power falls to the cantons
We are all Swiss; not French, German or Italian
Those are languages
Switzerland as a confederacy (in a prototypical ancient format) predates all of those modern nations
So the things that make us Swiss are older and more impactful than the language spoken
I feel more in common with a French speaking Swiss person than I do with a German national that speaks the same German language I do
Play with model railway, play games, read books, draw maps, play soccer, lego and similar stuff, played in the hay, playing with tha cats, playing with the neighbors kid
Schittliversteckis
Its some kind of hide and seek
You build small logs like a campfire
One person is the seeker the others the hiders
When seeker sees someone he has to get to his logs hand say your name and where he saw you
You now need to come out and be his prisoner
If one of the hiders manages to sneak around the seeker and kick his logs every prisoner is free again
Game ends when everyone is prisoner
hearts of hoi4
Comfortable
Very easy in French but different ways of saying it in English depending of where you come from
On the bright side, a lot of native speakers can't pronounce nuclear properly but I can haha
My trick for those words is to just drop the L. Pronounce it as "word" or "girfriend". Far easier and it sounds close enough to be unmistakable
Trust me, as an italian speaker i know that way too well
I live near the [Lavaux] a region known for it’s vineyards, by the lake Léman and the swiss and french Alps
It’s a beautiful area with a stunning view
If you’re ever visiting the region I highly recommend you go hiking there
There is a place in Switzerland called Cheese and Bread (Chäs und Brot)
Funny in (swiss)german:
Haltestelle -stop (for a bus or tram)
Dorf -Village
Wienacht - Christmas
Schwanzweid - cock meadow
Chäs und Brot - cheese and bread
Spitz - horny
Moskau - Moscow
Müllheim - trash home
Rotzloch - snot hole
Bière - beers
Brot-Dessous = bread-lingerie
Saanenmöser - creamcunter
Scherz - Joke
Affoltern - sounds like monkey torturing
Funny in english:
Prada
Dicken
Cunter
Bern Wankdorf
La Sagne
Ecce Homo
Bitsch
Horn
Only parts of towns:
End der Welt - end of the world
Altparadies - old paradise
Neuparadies - new paradise
we have a village called "Brot" which means bread and another one called "Dorf" which just means village
Titterten and Bitsch
There’s a place called Cunter in south east Switzerland, and Wankdorf near Bern where the Young Boys football team is from
There's a small town called "Bitsch"
Bitsch aka Bitch
I think we have Bitsch (Spoken out like Bitch)
Not a town or city, but my city's (Locarno) public transport company is called FART
As a teen i read Essex for the first time
Had a giggle
Porrentruy is pronounced like Boar in Sow in French , and their flag is a wild boar
Its German name is Puntrut which sounds funny too
Near me there's also Gland, which means acorn, but also means Glans (head of the penis)
And then there's a place that's just called Pigeon
And "Bitsch" in Valais
I usually get asked questions about what it is like to live in the harsh, snow covered alps
At least outside of Europe
In Europe I usually get asked about how rich I am or why my country will not just join the EU
I'm from Switzerland and live in the US
Usually it starts off with them asking me how many languages I speak and then start telling me some random story about Switzerland or Sweden (because they don't know the damn difference and Europe is apparently just one big country where everything is the same)
people usually ask me if I like chocolate but it really depends on the person, there'sn't any one big stereotype
Cheese, chocolate, watches, mountains and neutrality
Sometimes guns
Ohhh yeees i know i have been there i make you good price for good friend
Think of us like the hole in a delicious donut
We're not gonna join, just so the map will stay mildly infuriating
It defends the country from invasion
Right now they are providing medical, law enforcement and logistical support for the coronvirus thing, but in general the army practices defending the country from an invasion
I served in it back in the Cold War
We practiced ambushing tanks and infantry in the mountains and passes
Just because a nation is neutral and isn’t engaged in wars doesn’t mean it doesn’t need an army to defend itself
We are not in NATO, or other treaties, so we have to prepare to defend ourselves
Well the thing is banking isn't nearly as important as you make it seem
The financial sector, which banking is a part, is only responsible for 9
8% of GDP
Well, we are not still practicing Napoleonic war tactics
We practice one thing, defending Switzerland
The army is a modern mechanised force that trains regularly for the national responsibility of defense
As we get to choose the battlefield, and know it well, I think any modern army would find an invasion costly
The whole point of defending a tiny country with no natural resources is to make taking it so costly that it becomes a deterrent to even try
Better to stay neutral, have defensive capabilities, and do everyone's banking so they just ignore you
I suppose there is value in having combat experienced people that we lack, but I'm not sure how slugging it out in the deserts in the middle east would really improve defensive tactics in central europe
Technically, we are a third world military and nation using your country's definitions of the terms
Thing is, it never was
Banking was indeed important when banking secrecy was a thing (bigger than insurances in the financial sector) but it was not the money maker you make it seems
Financial sector was responsible for 11
1% of the GDP in 2008 when banking secrecy was ended mid-2009
We're only looking at a 12% loss for the financial sector
I think in european standards we have a big, expensive and at least average professional army
On the weekends you see many young soliders (army service is obligatory for (almost) every man) in the train with camouflage, rifles and sometimes a can of beer
I believe Switzerland keeps it’s army to NATO’s standard (without being a member of course) because surrounding countries didn’t want Switzerland in the cold war to become a weak point in Europe
Not only that, I “retired” from military service 15 years ago and I still have my rifle
Yeah it's the whole point of having an army organized as a militia
You're home but with a rifle at hand if something comes up
Also we don't only come home with the rifle the weekends: active duty is 300 days (I'll skip the details) but you're incorporated and keep in the reserve until you're between 30 and 34
During that time you have all your army belongings at home, army dress and rifle included
You can also buy your issued rifle, and/or handgun if you had one, at the end of service
100 for the SIGG550 and 30 for the P220
No snow in Geneva
Swiss/German Border (Basel) ... No real snow yet, only a few snowflakes one morning
That's it :/ If there will be snow it's always most likely at the end of February beginning of March, but tbh
The stakes are fairly low
We got a grand total of half an hour of snowing last month in Bern
It all disappeared in less than five minutes
It's pretty sad, like we don't get a ton of snow in the cities like in the mountains but at least there was snow last year
Now even a lot of ski regions have very little snow
We had a but of snow very early in November, then everything melted
December didn't see any snow, and we currently have a very tiny layer of snow, barely any
It really sucks because we used to get lots of snow throughout the winter, the local ski resort would be open the whole winter
This winter, it opened for maybe 3 weeks, around the New Year celebration
Pretty much the same in Lausanne, we had like three snowflakes one night in early december I think, but it melted right away and we had nothing since
If we're talking Europe, I'd say English, and better northern accents than southern ones
If we're talking world, then I'd say Korean
I find it smoother than Japanese, and "fuller" (if you get me)
I don't know exactly, but it's very possible, since Swiss citizenship has nothing to do with the place of birth
Well Napoleon already fits the bill
Yep, and going through the list of the hundreds of Federal Councillors we’ve had to find who was born abroad sounds really exhausting
Let’s just assume there’s been a few :’)
Our philosophy teacher told us animals can't think because they can't talk
I think there was some opposition but most students didn't care what he said anyways
Teacher of mine in the 11th grade (I worked for 4 years after the 10th grade, so I was 21 years old - meaning there's not even the reasonable assumption that I'm to young to be familiar with it) said utilitarianism is the philosophy of "reducing things to it's usefulness" which - in a very vague sense - could be right but overall is a gross misrepresentation
I was always a bit of a philosophy buff so I raised my hand and tried to elaborate
He was a nice and very knowledgeable man that really was invested in teaching us, so he'd surely appreciate it
I explained the most basic definition, even going into Bentham and Singer for it
He straight up shut me down
"It's about usefulness - it's right there in the name".
Bitch, I referenced primary sources in my definition
I think that trumps you trying to reconstruct the meaning through the name
Lost a lot of respect for that teacher that day
Ah, we had one of those German teachers, too
Everything except the most value-conserverative, Catholic or culture pessimist reading of a text was wrong
Even when it came to freaking Brecht, Dürrenmatt and Tucholsky
He was a Landtagskandidat for the AfD a couple years after I graduated
I see, so to the 2nd point is contrary to what (some) Americans get taught that they were the sole victor of ww2
But to be fair, the Americans did nothing for you in particular
~~One could even say they betrayed you (giving Stalin reign over you)~~
Edit : I'm retarded, excuse me
When you buy in just a little bit too much in that whole Sapir-Whorf theory
how
as in they took the bones, ground them up and used them as soil
I never said any of both viewpoints is correct
I wanted to give insight on why he might have said it
I never said I agree with that
I just heard that argument thrown around once (not Slovenia in that case, don't remember for which country)
And I don't think it's such a mental gymnastic
The allies wanted elections, the USSR blatantly ignored that request
I'm not blaming either side (although the communists did ignore that request) that you suffered from communism but either side could've stopped it
Yeah, it's widely celebrated, you eat Dreikönigskuchen which is a sweet bread composed of little breads and in one of them, there's a little king figure and whoever gets it is the king and gets a paper crown
Bread + crown are sold everywhere
I can't think of any
Switzerland is portrayed notoriously negatively in Hollywood movies
It's basically *evil banks, evil banks, evil banks, nazi gold, evil banks, that place where the cabal of evil shadow leaders and deep-state figureheads go to do evil seedy diplomacy and plan the New World Order, that place where some secret agent flees for 2 minutes before getting to his actual destination, more evil banks, that place where some dictator or bad guy has a secret bank account and the good guys need to close it down, that place that nobody gives a shit about
and more evil banks*.
You know funnily enough, in Bollywood Switzerland is considered a very romantic country
This is mostly due to the classic movie "Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge" or DDLJ for short
It came out in 1995 but still is playing in theaters in India to this day
Several scenes were filmed in Switzerland
[Here’s a song/scene] from it to give you an idea
I personnaly find it great, because it looks like they didn’t even try to make it look better, they just filmed it off the street like that
The grey sky, the sloppy melting snow, the people on the street looking puzzled, ... That looks more like the Switzerland I know than maybe any other movie I’ve seen
It used to be, yes
The banking secret for foreigners was abolished a few years ago due to pressure from the EU
That's not the point though
I'm not saying it's all wrong
I'm just saying those are negative stereotypes and it's not like the entire country is made up of that
It's a bit like portraying Americans as 400-kg, gun-crazy, truck driving, flag-waving hillbillies
Those guys exist but not every American is like that
It's as right or wrong as equating modern-day Germany with Nazi Germany
Yes, still far away from any realistic lifestyle tough
Especially since its a japanes series/movie
The banking secret for foreigners was abolished a few years ago
That's not the point though
It's not about whether these things are right or wrong
After all, the nazis also really existed
It's about whether these things make up an entire country; whether it's fair to say Germans = nazis or Switzerland = dictator bank accounts
My answer is a resounding no
To use another example: I'm sure there are Polish people who steal cars
However, if every single Hollywood movie portrayed Poland as a country of car thieves that would extremely unfair because the vast majority of Poles obviously don't steal cars
And germany still has Nazis in their parlament
None of you guys understands what the word "stereotype" means
I never said literally all of those things were wrong
The question is: is it fair to take all the worst parts of a country, completely blow them out of proportion and claim that this is the only thing the country is made up of
I could come up with all sorts of stereotypes about Germans and SOME Germans may fall into those stereotypes but certainly not all 80 million of them
I'm not, I'm actually pretty fucking poor
I'm disabled and dependent on social benefits
This stereotype that every Swiss is a billionaire who got rich off of other people's misery is extremely annoying
And it's unfortunate that fellow Europeans also buy into this BS
I thought only Americans were so gullible
This stereotype makes 0 sense and there is literally no proof
If there was actual proof, Switzerland would still be on all kinds of blacklists and could be sued for damages
And banking doesnt make up nearly as much of our economy as most people think
Yeah guess what Einstein, cost of living here is also far higher than in Spain
Also, I'm not touchy about the inner workings of my country, I'm touchy about the fact that you make unjustified and completely unfair generalizations
I don't know where all your hate and hostility is coming from, all I can tell you is that I'm a completely normal person, as is everyone else I know
For what it's worth, I won't assume that every Spaniard is still bemoaning the passing of Franco because I'm not a complete fucking moron
Helping people hide money and stealing money are two different things
Yes, Switzerland still has some problems with foreign tax evaders, but they arent actively stealing it
And its funny that you critisize the swiss press for beeing too discreet, while linking to an article of our public broadcaster
Yeah swissinfo is the international branch of our public broadcaster
They never post stuff in german/french/italian/romantsch but many articles get translated into our official languages or the other way around
This for example is the german version of the same article but under the banner of SRF (Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen):
What didn't he do
generally pretty neutral, altho people rave about the hotdogs and meatballs
personally I hate going there because it's always crowded with people and its pretty claustrophobic
Lol what
Germans make great WW2 jokes
In my opinion this is just a reddit thing
Ah true
Fair enough
Obviously there’s none in Switzerland, and sometimes I even forget they exist all around us
I find it weird thinking about it, I don’t like this dependance from the US, who’s a less and less stable country
Fun Fact:
US-Ambassadors aren't Diplomats
They are People who gifted the presidential campain a huge amount of money (every president, not just the current one)
They get the job as ambassador as a "thank you" for the money
The second highest officer in a embassy is the most importent one, because they are a diplomant and they have a clue what and how to do things
In most other countries, diplomats are elected by an apolitical comission or similar to that
Italian food
Also, French food
And German food, oh, Spanish food is also better in Europe than anywhere else
And Portuguese food, Greek food, Swiss food, Russian food, and so on
Except for English food, that isn't good, in Europe or anywhere else
I was partially joking, I love English roasts and fish and chips
I do love them
Argentinians couldn't agree more, haha
The source for that number in the wiki link is now dead, but when I checked it a few years back it contained "typical" UK cheeses like Camembert, Parmigiano, Brie, Gruyere, etc
So, I would take that British cheese variety with some caution, by the same metric the US could probably claim a similarly high number
edit: just checked the website in waybackmachine and I did remember correctly
Also, they don't seem to say that there are 1800 UK cheeses but 700 named cheeses produced in the UK
Of course, just wanted to point out that I don't buy that 700 number either as it contains cheeses that are typical from another country
I'm also not saying that I don't enjoy *typical* UK cheeses, I did have some good ones
Not that im aware of atleast
South american pre-colombian civilizations
They have a completely different timeline
It’s always fun to compare what happened in South america at the same time as what happenend in Europe, like at the time of Egypt, the roman empire, etc
Poland, as it has been struggling with foreign oppression for almost 200 years (1795 to 1991)
I recognize about 5 or 6 different European national anthems by melody, but not by lyrics
I only know the 1st verse of the Swiss anthem
Other anthems I recognize are Italy, Portugal, France, Germany, UK and Russia
I feel like rich people, especially the bourgeois/upper middle class type is so common here most of us don’t really pay attention to it
There’s also a lot of foreigners who come to Switzerland as a flex, I personally just laugh about it
Wealthy, yes many
But brand cloths and owning a nice car doesn't make you a showoff or rich
Not in one of the richest countries/cities on the planet
The average income in Zurich is very high
People mostly understate their wealth and often don't see themselves as rich even if they are
Zürich is a flex in itself, I wouldn't use it as an example
I'm trying to find swiss tv series, and at the moment, my answer is : It's probably Pingu
156 episodes over 10 years
I'm hoping someone will correct me, and tell me that nightmare inducing penguin isn't our national TV show
Edit : apparently a show named Lüthi und Blanc has 288 episodes over 10 years, so take that, penguin !
Still don't know if that's longest, but finding a list of swiss tv series on Google is apparently not an easy task
Pingu
It's Swiss-British produced, but made for and aired originally on Swiss TV
It later aired in UK, and a Japanese reboot came out even later
No idea where you got the South Korean from
Walliserditsch
Regardless of what the people from Wallis might tell you, they do not speak Swiss german
I'm a French speaker, and I understand people from each cantons pretty well (I just find the accent from Jura funny, but like cute funny)
But then, the Swissgermans are getting carried away
And to add to each canton having a different dialect, we have in Fribourg an old dialect called "Boltze" were they mix French and German
My grandmother speaks it, but it's starting to get less and less spoken
The only example of a word I can remember is "Schneeboula" which is a snowball, made of *Schnee* (German) and *boule* (French) + *a* (because why not)
Oh and we also have a "Patois" which may be some old variation of French they used to speak in mountains and farms, there's still some people speaking it, but mostly old people
My other gran used to speak it
As for swissgerman, I'm always wondering why I learnt German when I go to Bern, as they use French words like "Merci" and "Adieu". But so be it, oh Switzerland
vorlarlbergerisch sounds like a mix between Austrian and Swiss German
We usually get two or three days of snow per year around Zürich
And only if you go a bit higher on the hills
The Zürich itself is at the lake, which has huge heat capacity and is usually able to keep the city snow-free throughout the year
Of course we have some areas in the country that still get a metric shitton of snow every winter
I use apostrophes for thousands separators and points for decimals (e.g. 56'421
08), but I will read the decimal points as 'Komma' in German and as 'virgule' in French but as 'point' in English like everyone else
In Switzerland what I have seen is CHF 1'000'000
Never seen someone put a point on top, always apostrophes
Ah yes, the only correct way
The one and only way to write numbers
Same here, always did the 1'000 thing
It looks weird but it's very efficient and easier to differentiate than "your" version by a quick glance at bigger numbers
Mmmm I would write it 1'000'000,65
But nobody else is using it for some strange reason
Very interesting, had no idea that this wasn't a universal german language thing
I wouldn't say so to be honest
If you just take a quick look at a number it's easier to tell the difference between a " ' " and "," than "." and ",". Of course you can get used to it but it seems logical if you write one at the bottom and one on top instead of both at the bottom
~~He~~ She says while writing them backwards ;)
Edit: sorry I didn't read you name
They are the default ones in Word (annoyingly) but in school we learn to use ,, ...'' from the beginning and in papers for Uni, they are the standard as well
So I have to turn on the Deutschland German autocorrect in Word which then in turn tries to correct my ss that are ß in Germany
Never said it's a problem for anyone or you couldn't get used to it
All I'm saying is that it's easier by comparison
Both work but telling the difference between
" ' " and " , " is just even easier than
"." and "," (especially when hand-written)
of course both work when you're used to it
I think indifferent
At least that‘s my expierience
More than a quarter of the population doesn‘t belong to any religion
And from my expierience many people that belong to a religion don‘t believe in god or aren‘t sure
There are of course very religious people as well
Maybe these religious people don‘t like atheists but idk
I‘ve never had a problem saying I don‘t believe in god, when the topic comes up
I literally thought the same
Or it means bitch in French
"Oh you sad little kid
bitch"
With a sh, because most if not all sp and st sounds are pronounced with a sh in Swiss German
when speaking dialect with sh and in Standard German with s but it's not a conscious decision, it just happens for some reason
Oh you were just a second faster than me
Edit: when speaking English I pronounce it with an 's'. But in Swiss German it's definitely 'sch' /'sh'
In Swiss German too
Italian (to be able to speak it fluently), Irish for a very special lady and because I like the sound and Japanese to understand the gossip of my co-workers ;)
If only European languages are available I’d go for Rumantsch instead of Japanese
If you're at a pub to watch a big sporting match, you should at least buy a few drinks or a meal during the duration of the match
Nothing bothers me more than watching a Champions League match and seeing 5 guys taking up a table, all nursing a tea or a coke for the whole 90+ minutes
It's in poor taste, and why I'm absolutely in favor of cover charges (with credit towards drinks/food) for the big matches
All police here have pistols
In places like airports and train stations it is not unusual to see police working in two person teams, one with a pistol on their belt and the other with a submachine gun
Sometimes, under special circumstances, you might see these more heavily armed police out in the general public, like at large public events
I have no idea what kind of things riot and special swat team police use
It isn't really scary to me, as this is the norm, and the police here have never seemed particularly aggressive to me
Switzerland - police carry handguns on most occasions (except for stuff like riot control I think)
The exact model varies by Canton (~State), the most common ones being the HK P30 and the Glock 17/19
At airports I've seen them in 2-man teams with one carrying an MP5
There's a [report] on SRF (our national broadcaster) from 2016 talking about certain Cantons upgrading to semiautomatic rifles (usually something from the Sig SG55x family), but it's also mentioned that those weren't intended to be carried but instead kept ready at police stations
Intervention units have more or less everything from handguns to automatic rifles and precision rifles
we've got:
Eurasia
North America
South America
Africa
Oceania
Antarctica
North and South America are separate continents and "America" usually refers to North America or the United States, whereas South America will always be referred to as such
Australia is a both a country and a continent to us, we didn't really learn about what New Zealand belongs to
I didn't hear about Oceania until my late teens and that wasn't in school either
However, that is how I was taught \~15 years ago and the geography syllabus was recently updated, so I don't know how it's taught nowadays
Same, Oceania was often called "Australia *and* Oceania"
It depends quite a bit from city to city
In my city it's pretty good while in others there's still lots of room for improvement
Obviously it also depends who we compare ourselves with
Compared to southern Europe for example it's very good but compared to the Netherlands or Denmark, it's certainly lagging behind
To be completely fair though, some cities such as Zurich face a unique combination of challenges
For starters, Zurich is a very hilly city, which isn't the case for Amsterdam or Copenhagen
The streets are also very narrow; partially because the city wasn't destroyed during WWII, so we never had to rebuild anything
These narrow, hilly streets now somehow need to be shared by cars, trams and bicycles
in both directions of course
In most cases, that's only possible if parking lots on the side of the road are removed
However, in many cases, that is still not enough (and that's already super unpopular with conservatives)
So the next step is to remove one of the lanes and that is where it becomes super tricky
Typically, the city government doesn't want to remove tram lanes because public transport is very important for lots of people
So, that only leaves the car lanes
But what are you gonna do if you only have one lane in each direction
Make it a one-way only even if it's an important street
Abolish cars altogether
Remove the sidewalks instead and screw pedestrians
Sometimes there's just no easy solution and I actually wonder how cities in other countries solve this problem
arguably the best in the world from what i see(im not a cycler) -Switzerland
That sounds really cool
One problem we have in Switzerland regarding this is the fact that we have municipal roads and Cantonal roads
The municipal roads are within the jurisdiction of the village/town/city but the Cantonal roads are within the jurisdiction of the Canton
Some of the big streets that go through Zurich and other large cities such as Bern or Basel are Cantonal roads, which means the city doesn't have any authority over them
That's a problem because the cities are usually very lefty (both in terms of government and voter demographics) but the overall Cantons are usually quite conservative because they include a lot of rural areas
The right-wingers in the Cantonal parliament block any attempt to remove car lanes from Cantonal roads, let alone remove cars altogether
Is this also a problem in the Netherlands or do large cities such as Amsterdam have jurisdiction over all of their roads
Do the provinces get any say in it
“Si mon tonton tond ton tonton alors ton tonton sera tondu”
“If my uncle shaves your uncle than your uncle will be shaved”
And other variation:
“Ton tonton tond ton tonton”
“Your uncle shaves your uncle”
And since it’s french, obviously the “d” in “ tond” isn’t pronounced, making it a sentence with only the sound “ton”
Not my first language, but I remember learning about the passive voice in school, espacially the future tense
If I’m not mistaken there is such thing as 'werden gegessen werden' which sounds quite silly
It’s like German conjugation is so intricate you just ran out of words and had to use the same twice
And better then, when put in a subordinate sentence, you end up with something along the lines of 'weil wir gegessen werden werden' which sounds just ridiculous
(In English it would translate literally to something like ‘because we eaten will will')
Who on earth says octane
Everyone here says huitante
And we also say nonante in Switzerland
They even use it in announcements at train stations
Yep we say 'huitante'. I’ve never heard anyone anywhere in our country use the word 'octante'. I don’t know where it comes from and I’m honestly not even sure it’s a real word at all
I mean the literal translation
You could say that Switzerland follows whatever the antithesis of the cult of personality is, so this could get tricky
I think this is mainly due to the political system, because Switzerland never was ruled over by a single person, but always by a group of people
Also because of fairly low historical literacy
The single most well known (naturalized) Swiss citizen would be **Albert Einstein**, although  many people may not realize this
I still tried to make a list of people that should be reasonably well known, in no particular order and obviously not exhaustive:
* Henri Guisan
* Henry Dunant
* Henri Dufour
* Marcel Pilet-Golaz
* Ulrich Zwingli
* Ulrich Wille
* Jeremias Gotthelf
* Gottfried Keller
* Max Frisch
* Friedrich Dürrenmatt
* Paul Grüninger
* Mani Matter
If we include figures from legends and/or with questionable historical evidence as to their existence:
* Wilhelm Tell
* Arnold Winkelried
* Werner Stauffacher, Walter Fürst and Arnold von Melchtal
Theophrastus Bombast von Hohenheim aka Paracelsus is also pretty famous
The fact that you included Manni Matter makes me happy
You can add Jean-Jacques Rousseau as well as Alberto Giacometti
But you’re right about our lack of strong national figures, I don’t even know half of the people you listed
i honestly had to look up Pilet-Golaz
but if we talk about (historic) members federal council, i'd arguably add Jonas Furrer
Paul Grüninger on the other hand i'm afraid is still way too obscure - even though he absolutely should not be, i think whenever in switzerland the holocaust and the second world war is taught, people should start talking about him (and the terrible way he was treated)
But i'd also like to add some people that were not mentioned - and probably aren't well known - but in my opinion should be well known:
* Divico (granted, he predates switzerland by roughly 1300 Years)
* Gallus (technically born in ireland, but historically relevant to switzerland, also predates switzerland)
* Aegidius Tschudi
* Oskar Bider
* Anna Göldi
* Jean-Jacques Rousseau
then, historically important as whole aristocratic dynasties:
* House of Habsburg
* House of Kyburg
* House of Lenzburg
Of course you could also mention the House of Savoy, the House of Zähringen and the House of Welf - but those didn't have their family seats in (modern) swiss territories
&#x200B;
And some people i wouldn't necessarily call 'historical', but still somehwat important to swiss culture, heritage and science:
* Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi
* Carl Gustav Jung
* Johanna Spyri
* Some of the people that used to be on our Money:
* Charles-édouard Jeanneret (Le Corbusier)
* Sophie Taeuber-Arp
* Alberto Giacometti
* Leonhard Euler
* August-Henri Forel (although his history with eugenics is
yikes)
* Hermann Rorschach
* Jakob Bernoulli
* Julius Maggi
* Henri Nestle
It certainly has its perks
Thanks for adding him
Thanks for adding him
Those are all good points too
I feel like anyone we can list is somewhat niche and how many people know a given historical figure will also heavily depend on the Canton
In my list I mostly tried to go with the most well known people, though I'm viased too, so it's really a hatd task
I agree with you on Grüninger
There was however a movie about him a few years ago, which is why I included him
On which cards is willhelm tell
Tbh deadly accidents in the mountains are extremely common
Swiss German is my native language
Standard German is quite different from it, so much that I consider it a separate language
Of course I'm perfectly fluent in both but have a noticeable Swiss accent while speaking standard German though
I prefer speaking English over Standard German
I regard it as a really useful language, but I feel absolutely no passion towards it, unlike about my two native languages German and Swiss German
I just find it too inelegant
I find German extremely elegant: the spelling is phonetic except for a handful exceptions (such as "eu" being vocally rendered as "oi"); the case-based grammar allows you to construct extremely long sentences without any ambiguity about subjects/objects, and with free word order (except for the position of the verb); the language embraces the sub-sentence-ing (I really don't know how to say it in English, but in German we separate sentences much more into sub-sentences separated by commas) which allows you to bundle thoughts easier into discrete chunks without splitting them up (which can adversely affect flow); the vocabulary spirit allows you to get creative and create endless word combinations ad hoc (not just for bureaucratically condensing information, but also for humour, slang, etc
By contrast, English has **exceedingly** ugly and variable phonetic rules, the grammar is nothing special (except for the very useful past progressive), and the language loots words from all kinds of languages, which is not a bad thing in itself, but it means word combinations are much rarer and almost never combined without spaces between them, which weakens (or entirely eliminates) the association of it as a singular, dedicated concept
As programming language analogy: English is for me like C++/Javascript: functional workhorses with ugly warts
German is for me Typescript, Python or Rust: beautiful and also very useful
Swiss German would be C: a lean, mean, stripped down version of the thing you find beautiful (all the previous languages are descendants of C) that you can't really complain about and also find very elegant if you don't abuse its wacky features
My tapeworm sentences by the way highlight why I like German more, where this is less problematic
English pronunciation is so fucked up, it is definitely the worst point of the language
Another example, why are the X in 'anxiety' and 'anxious' pronounced so different
No sense, the spelling needs to be massively updated
Otherwise it is a pretty alright language, although phrasal verbs suck and prepositions also suck (e.g. why 'on the train' and not 'in the train'?, but 'in the car' is correct
), just doesn't sound as nice as others such as French, but it's not bad either
> I actually feel less weird speaking English than standard German, if that makes sense
Same
That's a sentiment very common in Switzerland
It's like standard German is in the uncanny valley of languages for us
We're soon having exams at the University
Like a few hundred people in a room
Of course there are countermeasures like proper distances between people, arriving/leaving in groups and wearing masks
I'm probably gonna get corona
I am a secondary school teacher in Geneva, Switzerland
I feel safe going back to school and as a matter of fact I strongly support re-opening it next month
It is a controlled environment as we know exactly who gets in the campus, and we got the students in the routine of regularly washing their hands and wearing their masks when in the corridors
There is some risk involved, but IMHO the benefits outweigh those risks
Among other things, I observed that during the closure of the school, the students with more problems at home lost their escape valve that is the school and their friends
All my students are also teenagers, they are eager to socialise and a significant proportion greatly suffered from the social distancing
In addition, it is too much asking to spend hours in front of a screen, that is awful enough for adults but teenagers need other forms of learning
Notwithstanding the domino effect that closing the school and sending my students home would have on their working families
Not Switzerland, but an iconic line from the former Drug Commissioner of Germany, Marlene Mortler, to the question why cannabis is illegal while alcohol isn't:
"Because cannabis is an illegal drug

Edit : this was in the context of relaxing confinement measures due to COVID-19
Jung & Naiv
Here in the french speaking part of Switzerland we’re very close to France, but not so much to other romance cultures
I don’t really feel any connection to Spain or Italy for example, and I think we’re actually more influenced by germanic culture than romance one
Even within Switzerland, we’re obviously connected by swiss culture with the two other romance languages (Italian and Romanche), but I can’t really say we have more connection with them than with the german speakers
I live in Bern and we have some very nice things
I think the best known is d'Zytglogge which is a clocktower
Then we have ds Münster, which is a church and dr Bäregrabe, thats were we kept our bears for a long time (now they have a new place right next to it called Bärepark)
The Kappelbrücke with the Wasserturm in Lucerne
In Basel, Switzerland we have many landmarks, but the most well-known is the [Basler Münster] dating from 1019
Yes, last year was its 1,000 year anniversary
(Swiss) German is just one *Hammer*, multiple *Hämmer*.
However Swiss German let's you have some fun with it:
>A: Hämmer Hämmer
>B: Hämmer
Hämmer
>A: Hammer
*: depending on the dialect it might be "Hemmer Hämmer
" and so on, as spelling is not standardized people form different regions spell things differently
Which translates to:
>A: Do we have hammers
>B: Hammers
We do have (them)
>A: Great
Swiss German words often changes the (stressed) vowel of a noun to the appropriate umlaut when it's plural
I don't know where it comes from linguistically, but it sure is a pattern:
\- *Hammer* \-> *Hämmer* (a -> ä)
\- *Hund* \-> *Hünd* (u -> ü) \[Hund = Dog\]
\- *Boda* \-> *Böda* (o -> ö) \[Boda = Floor/Ground\]
It also works the same with long vowels (which in standard German became diphthongs)
\- *Huus* \-> *Hüüser* (uu -> üü) \[Huus = House / compare with standard German *Haus* which has the *au* diphthong\]
It's even the same with diphthongs (btw
diphthongs containing umlauts are something that really separates Swiss German from standard German - German doesn't do them, except for the *äu* diphthong, and Germans can't pronounce them):
\- *Buach* \-> *Büacher* / *Büächer* (ua -> üa/üä) \[Buach = Book\]
\- *Stual* \-> *Stüal* / *Stüäl* (ua -> üa/üä) \[Stual = Chair\]
I'm not a linguists - what is an i-umlaut
In Standard German the three umlauts *ä, ö, ü* can also be written as *ae, oe, ue*, so I as a layman would have associated them with an *e* not an *i*.
In Swiss German and Standard German the *u* in *Hund* also changes to *ü* when it's female *Hündin* (still Singular)
Many female dogs wolud be *Hündina*/*Hündinä* (spelling varies) in Swiss German (*Hündinnen* in Standard German)
If I didn't smoke weed and didn't make dumb choices I could easily save ~ CHF 1'000
4'000 wage after taxes, 1'000 rent, 1'000 bills, 500 food, 500 for other stuff
Leaves 1'000
But I do pay fairly little for rent, sometimes it's a few hundred bucks more for the same size and quality
But my weed consumption costs me around 500-600 a month and with debt paybacks I can't really save that much right now
Also mind you, I have an entry level job and wage, and because I'm young get even less
People who are 30+ can easily make up to 5'500 or 6'000 for the same job
But they also have to pay more for health insurance and pension
Now the Alps are full of people and the cities are empty
Also languages will be kinda all over the place, we should get used to it, but tough day for all the transborder workers
There would suddenly be a lot of people in the alps and the flatter part of the country would be somewhat empty
Except around Zurich, all the Italian speakers from Ticino would end up there
Many people would finally have some steady good weather
In the woods just go off the path a few meters and piss behind/against a tree
Try to be invisible from the path
Outside of woods it's not a nice thing to do
Don't piss on a house wall or something
You could get fined for public urination (approx $150 I think) but never happened to me
If there's an event like carnival or similar they tend to put portable toilets and those plastic urinals outside
Of course there you'll just pee next to the street in urbanized areas but we all drunk and noone cares anymore
I'd take pasta that's too hard over one that's too soft for sure

I know of them because of american movies, but i am fairly certain they aren't a thing here

I was also always fascinated by the concept of spelling bees, like an anthropologist
I cannot imagine a more boring mental sport if I tried
I really can't.
It strikes me as an exceedingly autistic activity (I am not using the word as a negative/insult here, just as factual description of my impression)
*Maybe* it would get interesting if you could *regularly* include linguistic principles like e.g. etymological roots, phonetic rules, etc
But they pick tricky words, so you can't go "aha, it's a Greek-sounding word starting with an "s" sound, so the probability is decent it actually starts with "ps". Bu no, instead it's just mind numbing rote learning
I really am offended by spelling bees
My interests could not be more diametrically opposed, because I love coming up with stuff on the fly (keep in mind I have ADHD) -- my preferred mental battle would be philosophy/logic debates
Think i legit read the same comic, was it a topolino or something
Idk, dictées are kind of similar
There are a lot of silent letters in French
I could imagine a French spelling bee with low-frequency words
Federal Councils are elected by the Federal Assembly, which consists of both chambers of parliament
That's a total of 246 people
It's a tad more complicated than this, though
There are a total of 7 Federal Councils
Our constitution prescribes to make the Federal Council as representative of the Swiss population as possible
Although this is a fairly broad statement, most people interpret it to mean "represent the population in a number of key aspects, such as sex, age, language
and of course political opinions". Now, the big question is: how do you squeeze 8-9 parties of various sizes into an assembly that only consists of 7 individuals
In 1954, a parliamentarian came up with a rather brilliant idea, known as the "magic formula" (Zauberformel)
It says that the three largest parties in parliament should receive 2 Federal Council members each, while the fourth largest party receives one member
Smaller parties don't get one
Although this magic formula has never been put into law, it has always been followed since its inception in the 1950s with only one notable exception in the 2000s. It's basically a "gentlemen's agreement", if you will
Based on this agreement, it is predetermined which party will get to replace a Federal Council if one of the current ones decides to retire
For example our Social Democrats currently have 2 members in the Federal Council
If one of them decides to retire, all other parties acknowledge that this seat belongs to the Social Democratic Party
They won't try to steal it
The party who gets to replace their Federal Council seat then has to produce at least one new candidate
Usually there are 2-3 candidates
These candidates are presented to the Federal Assembly
All parties then get to vote on who they want to be the new guy/girl
The party who's replacing the Federal Council seat may recommend one specific candidate but other parties don't actually need to stick to that recommendation
Parliamentarians can vote for whoever they want
Very rarely it happens that a few parliamentarians won't vote for any of the candidates and will instead write one of their own party-members on their ballot
However, while not forbidden, this behavior is considered extremely rude and it therefore happens very rarely
It's also considered politically unwise because if you try to screw over other parties when they are vulnerable, you can be pretty sure they'll do the same to you once you have to replace your own Federal Council seat
There's a very important term called [**consociationalism**] which is a cornerstone of Swiss politics and Swiss culture
In essence, it means that in a country that is very much divided along cultural, ethnic, linguistic etc
lines such as Switzerland, power-sharing is extremely important
Contrary to the US for example where politics are very dirty, Swiss politics are very conciliatory
Everyone understands that in order to keep the country together, it's important to involve as many people in the political process as possible and to represent as many people as possible
This is why all parties in Swiss politics support their opponents' claim to power
It's a peaceful way of creating a functioning society, government and leadership while avoiding serious divisions, disenfranchisement or violence
Every post I see on this sub where I think: Uh I can answer that our system is quite interesting and unique theres a post from you thats like a fucking school presentation with every little detail
How do you do it
Due to this system, there is virtually no opposition
The closest thing we have to that is SVP, the biggest party in Switzerland, our national conservative party
They sometimes act like an opposition and block stuff but it's not that extreme
Also, being the biggest party doesn't really help them because all the others don't agree with them on most issues
There's some pressure from my partner's parents asking when we want kids
I always tell them the moment they agree to look after my kids too or are ready to co-finance such an endeavour
Kids are bloody expensive
I dont really think so, but that might just be my family
Hope others can maybe say a bit more
**Appenzell:** Pretty much the Alabama of Switzerland, lots of "patriot" people and it often is mocked about how only incest people live there
**Zürich:** Arrogant people, basically the "real" capital of Switzerland
**Luzern:** China: Part 2
**Bern:** They move and talk very sloooowly
**Thurgau:** Apples, apples, apples, apples, apples and even more apples
Also home of the ugliest dialect in Switzerland
**Jura:** Doesn't exist (Jura is the newest canton and is often forgotten)
**Aargau:** Worst drivers in the country, their numberplate "AG" apparently stands for "Achtung Gefahr
" (German for: Watch out, danger
In Switzerland we only have stereotypes for the people who speak the same language
German speaking
Zürich: arrogant (no we're not, you're just jealous)
Bern: slow (they really speak slowly and it sometimes seems like they even walk more slowly)
Basel: I don't know, I just know that Zurich and Basel hate each other
Maybe you could make fun of their dialect
Thurgau: their dialect, rural people live their I guess
Schaffhausen: their dialect
Gallen: their dialect (all these three are kinda similar)
Appenzell Ausserrhoden: not much
Appenzell Innerrhoden: very conservative, like Alabama but without the pro-life (at least I think so)
Graubünden: not much (is very complicated and somewhat diverse, Graubünden is like a smaller version of Switzerland inside Switzerland)
Aargau: province, enemy of Zurich
Wallis/Valais: conservative, nobody can understand them
Uri, Schwyz, Obwalden, Nidwalden: conservative, where Switzerland began in 1291
Luzern: I don't know
Zug: I don't know, really small
Is there anything else
French speaking
Valais/Wallis: nobody can understand them (yes, the French speaking half of this canton has the same stereotype as the German part)
Jura: funny accent, Jura libre since independence from Bern, nationalists
No idea about the rest
In Graubünden, they call the Surselva (one valley there) a 3rd world place
In another valley, Engadin (originally only in the lower part, the others were added later), they have a stereotype/nickname for every single village
The first stereotype about Moldova here is that it's part of Romania
Why do most countries have a place with sheep shaggers
Do we have one
The clichés I hear about some cantons are:
**Geneva**: arrogant complainers and pretentious big mouths (sometimes called "grandes gueules" in French)
**Vaud**: sluggish and jovial simpletons who are always up for some beer at the bistrot
**Jura**: irresponsable yet jolly party animals and roadhogs
**Neuchâtel**: refined, cunning and sophisticated (come to think of it, I haven't heard a lot of pejorative stereotypes surrounding them)
**Valais**: drunkards, Subaru Impreza drivers and wolf hunters - there's also a lot of incestuous jokes around them as well
**Fribourg**: unhygienic and lazy (at least when it comes to the stereotypes surrounding the French speaking part)
Wallis:  is Kinda alabama too for the incest part but they aren't as mutch patriotic as Appenzell
But they are mountain cavemen tho
Nice seeing the french speaking part got some funny cliches too haha
Coming from Valais, I can say you're right, even though I must say we are the best at drunk-driving
they also speak the language of the gods
Lucerne is always filled with massive amounts of Chinese tourists, especially on the Kapellbrücke (famous bridge over the Reuss in Lucerne)
>and Zug are full of rich foreigners who stroke tax deals (as in Pauschalbesteuerung)
Not sure if anyone actually comes from here
I do :(
Hahahahahahaha
Never thought of that one, but I don't think that any canton has that stereotype
I know right
But Fribourg is kindof better for this
Yeah that might be a slight issue
The French border is 500 meters from my house
The German border is about 2 km down the road
I can see both countries out my window right now
It opens up some cool shopping opportunities and one can listen to diverse news sources quite easily
Before coronavirus restrictions came to be I would travel to both countries at least once a week
The border is only noticeable by the presence of Swiss zoll customs stations and the occasional border police inspecting people for undeclared goods
if you live next to the border the other side doesn't feel like a different country but more like extended home, in fact more so than most of your own country
All the time, I often go France (less now because of corona) just to go shopping because it’s so much cheaper
The prices in Ticino are the same, but Swiss Germans love to make holiday-trips there
Some people just go there for a week-end or a day trip
Maybe the parking lots of shopping centres are the only ones available
And don't forget Swiss Einkaufstourismus
I really miss Edeka
I have a government issued assault rifle in my home
I think that is a rather uncommon thing
Aromat
I am currently in the army and at all times i carry a small can of it with me
(It‘s a spice, more or less)
And, to make everybody even more confused: The assault rifles are fully auto until you leave military service
This includes being in the reserves for sometimes over 10 years
So basically there are many people here who got a full auto assault rifle for free and the government is just like "come back in 10 years and let me convert it to semi auto later".
And of course you get the gun along with free training during service
And 2 yearly free shooting events if you want to
Oh and you want a pistol as well
Just need proof that you're trained on that model and to get a background check (if you left the service already) and you can rent it for free in addition
But if you want to get the real picture: after the service you put the rifle in the wardrobe, take it out once a year for the shooting event if you have to and after you just forget that you even have it
If you're not part of a shooting club doing it as a sport at least
And no, you can not carry a gun here
There are more suicides by gun in comparison to other countries, however homicides using guns are rather rare
It's actually pretty common here as well
All the italian immigrants in the last century brought that with them it seems
You can find it in many households and it seems to be very popular among students and hikers
However, it's often referred to using a derogatory word for those italians
Well the italian one is just superior
Of course ours is still the best but italy gets close second ;)
And fuck schuko, why does it have to be this fucking big
Usually you mostly see kids/teenagers in more rural areas having those here
Not in cities really
For sdults it's usually just some reflective seam on jackets or backpacks
But not mandatory at all
Think it's quite common here as well however mostly among those that like cooking
Don't really need it for shitty pasta ;)
It has a Swiss shield emblem on the top of the receiver
Sadly no corkscrew or beer opener on it
If you want to show other swiss people how swiss you are, you use aromat
No idea
Damn I didn't know for all this time
That's kinda cool
Or use our trusty Swiss Army Knife before
Free health care for all, allegedly quite wide-spread in the EU
I really like to badmouth the USA at every occasion, but the east- and westcoast and especially Canada are so far ahead of us on this
It's sad
>We’ve got mandatory health insurance of about \~€110 a month
In addition: the first €385 of health care costs are for yourself each year (if you need healthcare that is)
Trust me when I say: this is extraordinarily cheap when compared to Swiss premiums
Fast
Not immediate, if you are on a mandatory insurance plan only
However, no Dr House episodes here
Immediate, if you are in a private insurance plan
Because otherwise, you wouldn't subscribe
Well, it leaves one with streets that are not accessible to cars, and creates logistical issues with parking, construction, utilities and such
We put a lot of that stuff underground beneath the old city
I think it makes for a nice, walkable city with lots of pedestrian areas
Driveable roads and space for trams and public transport surround the old city, so one can readily reach any part of it very easily with a short walk of a few minutes time
The oldest thing where I live is a small ruined fort built by the Celts in the first century BC
It was trashed by the Romans in 58 BC when they took over the region
Most of the old city dates from around 1356 or newer because a large earthquake in 1356 destroyed the older stuff, with a few notable exceptions (a cathedral, etc
Well in Switzerland we have the beautiful saying "alles ussert dSVP" or "everything but the Swiss Peoples Party", so yes, strategic voting definitly happens
but you have more than enough alternatives to choose from
ive never come to the situation where i voted for someone just for the sake of him/her not being SVP
idk, maybe it happens in the smaller cantons with fewer candidates
but in the big cantons you usually just vote for who ever represents you the best
If we had a voting and election system like the US, the polarisation would really become apparent
The biggest parties are both really far away from each other
With our system it is relativly easy to avoid voting for the SVP because of the many choices we have
But just imagine if we didn't. The SVP would dominate everything
Well in general elections, definitly
There are elections tough where you can still apply it
City council, justice election etc
often dont have enough alternatives that represent you and I definitly apply "Everything but SVP" when it comes to a head on head
Yeah, i should have definitly clarified
The name itself could easily be a name of a left leaning party or a more moderate conservative party, but they are just another populist right wing party
I would rather not imagine but yes, we can be happy that we have the political system that we currently have since its somewhat "unfair" to stronger parties since we have things like the Zauberformel or other checks and balances that allow a bigger diversity in our political landscape
While I hate the SVP, im glad that they are the furthest right party with relevance and not as bad as the AFD
Imagine the right wing of the CSU, thats probably the closest you get
You could describe them as "farmer-conservative" without any ambitions outside of our borders
The AfD is a pure "anti-system" demagogery party, but the SVP is a  "normal" party that, for the past 20 years selectively puts on an 'provocative opposition party' marketing whenever the people running it think it's going to suit them
It still has a fairly large population of voters who were there before Christoph Blocher took over, and are classic right-wing conservatives without being populists, by they tend to shut up as long as the populist rhetoric wins in the ballot boxes
And those running the party aren't incompetent or stupid by any means, but they are very twisted
I personally have only experienced this once before
There were three candidates SP, FDP and SVP, whereby the SP candidate had no chance and the SVP candidate was a big idiot
So I had to vote for the FDP candidate, although I would have preferred the SP candidate
Regarding the "Zauberformel": Do you think the SP and/or FDP will ever have to give one of their seats to the Greens and/or the GLP
Well, Switzerland is an Island in the middle of the EU
Since our economy heavily relies on trade with the EU, we need a so called bilateral accord, an agreement that regulates trade, research and everything else between Switzerland and the EU
While every party agrees that we need a bilateral accord, the way the accord should look and how it should be negotiated are highly controversial
While most parties have somewhat realistic expectations, the SVP is a bit overconfident
They basically think that we are more important to the EU than the EU is to us and therefore we should be the ones to make demands, which is, of course, fucking bullshit
They also threatend that they would rather have no deal than a "bad deal" which would destroy our insanly high level of quality of life in just a few years
You can compare it to the Brexit negotiations to some extent
Switzerland is neither in the EU nor in the EEA
That means we have to have our own bilateral treaties with the EU instead of an automated one in the EEA
Right now there are negotiations between Switzerland and the EU about a new bilateral treaty which would simplify our realtions
The SVP is completly against this because "EU bad" and "sovereignty". The other parties are also reluctant to sign this treaty because of specific things in the treaty, but in the end probably have to sign it, to not wreck our economy
Well, if we are beeing honest the next party that would have to give up a seat would be the CVP or the FDP but I think that will only be possible if the GLP and the GPS can confirm their results of 2019 in the next election
If that is the case, their best bet would be to find a candidate that fits both the GPS and the GLP and attack one of the FDP seats with their new found strength
It might have been possible last year aswell, but the GPS just assumed that the GLP would support every GPS candidate instead of the FDP alternative, which was just foolish thing to assume
I think the biggest difference lies in the genesis of these two parties
The SVP was founded with the merger of several different parties in the 1970s. One of the main members was the BGB, which stood up for the needs of farmers and simple workers
For a long time (partly still today) the SVP was seen as the party that should stand up for the needs of precisely these people
In fact, this has not really been the case for a long time
The SVP is basically an economically liberal (if there are economic advantages) but culturally conservative party
In my opinion this has nothing to do with farmers and workers, but with rich and tendentiously racist people
Some of the main contents of the party programs of the AfD and the SVP are congruent, but the history and the reasons behind it are partly different
Nevertheless, according to studies, the SVP is the 'most right-wing' party in Europe
So even more conservative than the AfD
In addition, the SVP tends to be a bit more serious, probably because they 'represent' a large part of the people - in contrast to the AfD
But they too sometimes like dishonest and, above all, populist methods
It's impossible to not mention how there was a pre-Blocher SVP, and a Blocher era SVP
Before Blocher took over, there was the Bernese and the Zürich wing - the first being rural conservative moderate right-wing pro-farmers, the second being the rich industrial capitalists looking to push their interests
Blocher was the leader of the Zürcher wing, and by inundating the party with his personal wealth, *de-facto* took over the entire party
We've been having this discussion for years and the SVP still believes in it
They even threatend to close the Gotthard Basistunnel (google it, its just a long train tunnel through the Alps) since apparently they think that there is no other way to transport goods from the northern europe to italy and the EU would definitly cave in if we did so
The only really pro-EU party in Switzerland is the SP (they even had/have "joining the EU" in their party program, but they see a problem in the worker's right's if the EU treaty gets accepted
I would not consider the greens a pro-EU party but they often share their viewpoints with the SP
The greens and the SP are nearly the same party, except the different focus (SP focuses on social aspects and the greens on ecological)
The SP is more of a governing party than the greens and thus they are more important when it comes to their viewpoint on foreign policy
Of course we are dependent on trade with the EU, especially food, but trying to rationalize with right wing populist is a lost cause
Well due to our political system they will never be the only party in control of the government and theyve lost some imporant elections in the last few years, so im hopeful
Well, it seems that the oppression of women is slolwly disappearing
It depens on the person I guess
We’re usually known among our neighbors for being quite slow, but people who live in the mountains and know those narrow snake-like roads by heart will go pretty fast
If you’re not used to it it’s quite scary as the passenger
lol i have a TT and im scared to drive it in most places in Italy ,to narrow for even that little car
We mostly avoid this problem here by giving up on cars and riding trains
Franzl Lang - Mei Vata is a Appenzeller is what people think what Swiss music is but idk which song describes Switzerland
RIP Franzl Lang
Maybe also jd BoBo I don't know
I don't know where the name comes from but there's a town named Thun and the lake next to it is called lake Thun but not a single Thuna lives in the lake nor the river flowing from the lake through the town
The bavarian language is less and less common amongst each younger generation
Large cities like Nürnberg and Munich are already almost completely high-german-speaking
You see this in other european regions like Brittany in France, where almost noone speaks Breton anymore or the Raetoroman part of Switzerland
It’s different in Switzerland, where dialects are a huge part of your identity
The Swiss German dialects are also not associated to rural vs urban environnements
We're both in home office these days
We are getting up quite early, but besides coffee/tea there's no breakfast
At around 11:00 we sometimes have some small lunch, typically a salad of some sort
But at 17:00 we stop working and concentrate on ourselves
A lot of time is regularly spent in the kitchen while cooking a real dinner (e.g. [Gnocchi from scratch] just the other day), during which sometimes a glass of Prosecco is consumed
These are the most relaxing hours of the day
Can recommend
I think this is a matter of self-organisation, not one of modern society in itself
I work full-time, and still have a lot of free time
We also have them in Zurich on one footbridge across the river (for some reason all of them are there) and it looks really ugly and it's polluting the environment too
Yeah I've been doing that for the last 3 years
But with interruptions when you're sick or on vacation and so on
So far it's been great
Yeah that's sad
I'm quite lucky as there are many different ones here but I tend to go to the same every time
Lugano (all of Ticino really)
Italian speaking
Almost Mediterranean climate
I also feel like I’m in a different country in Geneva sometimes
The rest of the Romandie feels Swiss even with the different language, but for some reason Geneva feels extremely French to me
But Ticino definitely feels totally different
Climate, scenery, architecture, language, food, everything feels different
But coming back to Ticino from Italy makes me feels at home, so it doesn’t quite feel Italian to me
Coming from the canton of Vaud, we always take the piss at Geneva by calling it France, and I can’t say it’s unfounded
However people of Geneva don’t like being called french and will be angry at you if you do
Must be the margherita
I'll accept being called French if you can accept that Vaud are mostly British expats that don't speak a lick of French
Just a normal sized one
30cm or similar, just the standard size
While 20CHF for a pizza is a reasonable price in a restaurant, 18CHF for a kebab is a scam, or did you get it with extra gold in it ? All the ones I know are 8-10CHF
Welcome to Switzerland indeed
Friend came to visit me from the U.S.
I was late picking him up so he decided to get himself a coffee while waiting
(his story)
I gave the cashier a 20
She gave me back 3 coins
What the fuck man
If it was a menu then yeah sorry that’s a normal price :’) If you ever come back to Switzerland, I advise you to just always carry your own water bottle, you’ll save quite a few bucks very quickly
If this many dialects alredy fit within ~41'000km^2 then I don't dare imagine how much it would change even two countries over
I don't even speak it but I vote for Rumantsch because it's pretty cool and I can understand some parts of it
I would choose a gone language we fictionally share(d) on the continet: Valyrian
Plus: Swiss German doesn't really have rules
And only 2 time forms
Pretty simple stuff
Con: no rules
Meanwhile here it's sometimes pretty hard to understand someone that's living 150km away in some valley
I think Swiss German variations can be way more extreme than English ones are
For example some local variants even switch around the word order in a sentence which, while you get used to that, throws you off a bit if you aren't.
But then again you have regions where variations are very slim and it might as well be the same
Oh yes I definitely agree
The same can be seen in some traditions that are contained to some small areas/remote parts
And rumantsch, which is a completely different but small language, is spoken in some remote vallies is eastern Switzerland and has very different writing/speaking forms for each one of those
Sorry the writing system is a bit shitty worded from my side
Yes it's also using the Latin alphabet
The difference is more like two different languages, same alphabet but very different pronunciation/words
There are 5 mayor variants of it and some really can not communicate with each other at all
Rumantsch is not really related to German but stems from Latin/Italian if I remember correctly
It does sound somewhat similar to Italian but destinctly different, so even as a non speaker I can distinguish those two
Rumantsch is actually one of the 4 official Languages here in Switzerland
There's an official TV channel, and all other government stuff could be requested in this language
Practically though almost all of those native speakers are completely bilingual with either (Swiss) German or Italian though so it's more of a let's keep it alive than a necessity
There are only roughly 50k native speakers, however I don't think it's dying out
Maybe what we did to our own children
Verdingkinder who were nothing more than slaves
Or taking the jews gold from Hitler
But that is more a mistake of the banks
Recently, voting to close our nuclear plants
We'll regret it later
Uhm
I don't know
But I might be able to tell you in a year or something, depending on how we negotiate with the EU
Too hot starts at 27° C here for me, I might feel different in other parts of the world though, for example 30° C in Athens isn't like 30° C in Zurich because of different levels of humidity and wind
For the rest check out the list by u/HSDev18
Sleep late and sleep as soon as I get home even though I'm taking Vitamin D3 tablets
Basically hibernate until spring unless there's a reason to go outside
Wtf I would kill myself
Yeah
Lovely
Probably not too infrequented but I was in Greece a few years ago and when we were in a restaurant in Athens I used the bit of modern Greek I had learned before the trip (I was learning ancient Greek in school back then) and the waiters were somewhat impressed and it made them very happy and they gave us some extra food
Edit: oh and back home at the Christmas market there was gyros stand and I ordered in my broken Greek which confused the guy but I then explained the ancient Greek thing
Yeah same but I've met like zero Welsh people
Okay thank you for explaining how 'whom' works, I needed that
Yeah I know, but I feel like I should know how to use it with the amount of English I learned in school over the years, especially since I text in English with one of my former classmates and she seems to use it correctly so I should know too I guess
How about some direct democracy ?
Switzerland can provide the punctuality that is needed here
That's actually a pretty funny name
In German we usually just use the English idea --> [Helikopter-Eltern]
I'm not sure if there even is a special word for the kids of Helikopter-Eltern
I usually just call them a "verzogener/verwöhnter Fratz" which would translate to "spoiled brat".
Glucke for the mother, too
As in „Motherhen“.
I usually just call the children "Einzelchinder" ;)
I live near the Matterhorn and until two years ago I never went
It was actually pretty nice
Fresh air, cooler temperatures, not that much tourists (which was surprising)
You start counting at 21
Ein-und-zwan-zig, Zwei-und-zwan-zig, Drei-und-zwan-zig etc
(21, 22, 23 ...)
I was about to reply that we do the same here until I noticed we're both from Switzerland lol
Yes, in German, two-digit numbers are said "backwards", in Dutch it's the same I believe
So for example 72 is "zweiundsiebzig" (two-and-seventy)
I can work best when it's around 15-20 degrees Celsius
anything above 25 and I start getting tired
sorry
I would recommend to choose whatever you're talented at and passionate about
Luckily, we don't have the kind of situation in Switzerland where the country is overflowing with academic degrees like in the US and some EU nations
This is due to our unique education system and the exclusive status of university education
Contrary to America, only a small percentage of students (15%-20%) make it to university because you need very good grades
When I go online, I often see people deride the social sciences and especially the humanities
However, in real life I make very different experiences
Most of my best friends, my wife, my brother and myself have all degrees in the humanities and we're all doing fine
None of us is struggling to find a job specifically due to the fields we've studied
In fact, sometimes humanities degrees can get you pretty far here
For example a lot of people want to become a high school teacher
The education is considerably longer and more challenging than in America (it takes about 7-8 years of study) but the pay is very good
Some people also end up in private companies and do very well there
For example I know a woman my age who studied philosophy and now she's a career-climber in a big insurance corp
That isn't to say that technical or natural science fields are bad in any way
I encourage anyone who is into that to follow their dream
Contrary to the STEM-people who love to hate on the humanities, most humanities people like myself actually have a very favorable opinion of other fields
For example I would have loved to study medicine but I'm blind, so that wasn't an option
So yeah, if I had children, I would tell them to follow their passions and talents
This is also true by the way if they were among the 80%-85% of teenagers who don't attend high school and later university
Society claims there are some apprenticeships that are more "worthy" or "valuable" than others
For example becoming an electrician is supposedly better than a car mechanic or a cook
But you know what
If cars or cooking are your passion and you're genuinely good at this stuff, you should choose that path
There are a lot of people who tell others to choose a job/field (such as STEM) even if they are completely uninterested and untalented at it and I find that beyond idiotic
Like, what's the point of wasting many years of your life to get a Masters in engineering if you don't give a shit about it and you suck at math
It makes no sense
What a healthy society needs, above all else, are people who are happy with their lives and enjoy what they do for a living
Apparently we do have humour
It's probably somewhat due to the fact that no matter the job, if you make minimum wage (which isn't clearly defined but usually around 3-4k/month) then you can leave a ok life
Nothing fancy but you get by without debt, a second job or awful hours
So yeah, in the end it's delusional to say it doesn't matter
But he kinda has a point as just cause you're a cashier or server you're not gonna starve
You have bohemian dumplings and therefore won
Svíčková is so good omg
If you plan to go international then yeah you have a point
Just as getting a swiss police education or swiss law degree isn't that useful outside Switzerland
But luckily here we have more equality between STEM and humanistic degrees, at least if you compare it to some other places
It's still not perfect here of course but that's probably a given
(Even in time of crisis/war you need new buildings, roads and IT
Not so much art and gender studies
Because one is necessary to survive and the other isn't. But why should we only barely survive and not live well and comfortable when we can afford it
How much we want to/can afford it dictates how equal those studies will be)
[Rivella]  is a Swiss soft drink made from milk whey
i think it‘s available in some parts of neighbouring countries as well (close to the border) but i‘ve never seen it anywhere else
16-year olds can afford intercontinental travel out of their own pocket
Hey, that's illegal
(/s)
I feel exactly the same way about this
This probably means that I'll have to move to Sweden
In German, it's not as bad as in English but still not great
Personally, I often use the unchanged names
Dude we have good bread too
I have to admit you're right
same here in switzerland except we call it z’vieri
iirc the Rivella in the Netherlands are brands we didn't like but the Dutch for some reason did
May not be true, heard it from my teacher once
It's less the bread itself and more the ability to, every morning, go buy cheap but warm and excellent bread at the bakery that's around the corner
In every other country I've stayed in there is either no local bakery, or the bread is not as tasty or too expensive
It's still cocoa, just only the butter
So I'd still call it chocolate personally
Kim Jong Un went to school here as well
Rockets are flying because he is out of Emmental cheese again probably
Yeah but we professionalized this stuff and it wasn't just with the Nazis
We were (and to some degree still are) the masters of authoritarian money and education from all over
Because if there is one thing you can do in this country it's being rich and keep to yourself
Be Kim Jong's son and you go to school here and nobody knows
Russian oligarch fresh out of jail
I saw that dude casually on the train mate, nobody gave a shit
Uhm, which atrocities did switzerland commit
I don't argue that we were super clean but atrocities
We after some time took no more jewish refugees but it was not like we took none, is that an atrocity
Maybe, but not in the context of the time
> the masters of education from all over
Could you name a few
I only know that Kim Jong-un went to school here for 2 years in his teens
Barbarian
Same goes for Switzerland
Some dude said we shouldn't have been neutral
Definitely when we were surrounded by the axis after 1941
It's a fact
> Switzerland explicitly enabled the financial and logistic aspects of the Holocaust
Do i understand this right
IBM (American Company) sold the nazis technologies and went trough Switzerland for it
Are orange Fiskars scissors from Finland a thing in your country
These [amazing little scissors] were a staple in my family's household since I can remember
Even though this particular kind is apparently intended for fine needlework, we mostly used them as medical scissors, for wound care and stuff
The first aid kit always had one in them, and dad got really mad if you took them without putting them back
Same with mom, who had a second pair for actual needle work
The third pair I luckily got to take with me back when I moved out, but unfortunately I lost it a while ago
Only when my mom (reluctantly) sent me her pair to replace them, did I actually notice the brand name, and that it's a Finnish product
These must be well beyond 20 years old by now, and are still just as sharp as ever
Before that I tried my luck in a pharmacy, assuming they must have them and know what I'm talking about:
* "Could I get a pair of those small, sharp precision scissors for wound care
You know, the tiny orange ones
* <blank stare>
* "No
* "These are the only ones we got"
* <hands me a pair of lousy, dull scissors with rounded tips>
So I guess reactions could go either way: Either everyone knows what I'm talking about, and cherishes them as well, or everyone's wondering why someone can get this excited about a pair of  scissors
*Edit: Wow, thanks to everyone who responded
I had a feeling these could be popular, but didn't quite expect so many reactions :)*
We have a pair of large red ones in my home, I’d never realised they were something particular
Oh wow, that's interesting
When googling for this vote, this turned up:[Deconstructing Product Design: Exploring the Form, Function, Usability, Sustainability, and Commercial Success of 100 Amazing Products]
>Bäckström sent orders for the first plastic prototypes to be produced in black, red and green
The plastic works was finishing a production run of Fiskars popular plastic orange juicer, and residual material had been left in the machine
Rather than let it go to waste, the **frugal operator decided to use the remaining orange plastic to create prototypes in an unrequested fourth color**. The prototypes were delivered, and the scissors with the black and orange handles were deemed the favourites
Fiskars then decided to take an internal vote to make a final decision between black and orange, and the prototype with the orange handles prevailed
So that iconic orange color is basically a happy accident - neat :)
>I love them a lot, I use them for everything
Right
If you need a dependable pair of scissors for some fine stuff, these are the ones for the job
I never realized how much I appreciated them until I lost mine
These days I'm using mine to carefully snip off early flower buds off my chili peppers without harming any of the tiny leaves close by :)
I... was an active kid
There was a need for some dedicated medical hardware in our household ;-)
For me it was the other way round - I had no idea they're from a company that also makes axes and gardening gear
But would certainly buy from them if I happen to come across it
That's the thing, I don't think I've consciously noticed this brand in Switzerland even once
But now that I know what they're called, they seem to be readily available
Ok, that is quite unsettling :)
And "clothing and accessory collection designed for gardening and urban exploring", plus "jacket with stab-proof pockets".
What's their target audience
Serial killers on the run, with a knack for gardening
>They still make razor blades/shaving stuff
That's what they're known for here
Not that I have shaved in the last three months
*noises of angry Swiss people with sticks*
I don’t know them here, but I live in the french speaking side
Maybe it’s more popular in regions closer to the border with Austria ?
We are famous for apricots in my region but I don't remember something like dumplings
McDonald's is the only thing open that late
Maybe a kebab
Edit: most bars I know sell grilled cheese sandwich or stuff like that
Usually every restaurant and other food seller is closed at this time, except some Mcdonald’s, so that’s pretty much the only option if you want to eat out
I do not think that such a building exists
What comes closest to the uniqueness of an Eiffel Tower or Statue of Liberty is probably the [weather station on the Jungfraujoch] or the [Kapellbrücke in Luzern]
Swiss are not the right people for expensive, big prestige-buildings
But I find the parliament in Bern mentionworthy: not only the outside, but also the inside, the water fountain in front of it and the idea it stands for
I concur with others, I think the jet d'eau is more iconic, perhaps the Château de Chillon too
I'm very sorry about that
Noo the roche towers (there's two now) are neat
Also now Zurich doesn't have the highest building anymore, so suck it Zurich
I have a friend with a very good and expensive bike and he put black tape on it to hide the brand and give it a shabby look and it works extremely well
This is by far the dumbest shit ive read in awhile
Tell me if I'm mistaken, but I'd say since 1815
It's actually the real beginning of Switzerland, then some cantons changed a bit
The Sonderbund war was a civil one, so no other country pressure there

Depending where you go
If you'd go to a "better" bar, you would get the same reaction
All bars I'm used to go would be glad that you're here as every money is money and the people are there for having good times and a drink together
And it's to be said, that the shot prices don't really vary in the city I live
In most places a shot is 5 Swiss Francs
For some reason we were thaught about the eskimos for almost a year in elementary school
Then about the germanic tribes and medieval switzerland
In 7-9 grade we stopped learning about ancient subjects because we look into the french revolution, ww1, weimarer republik, ww2 and the cold war
It's hard to answer this question, because i believe that every single country has something worth seeing to offer
But being brother to a lesbian sister, i'd avoid poland

Was having a drink at a hotel in Zanzibar and I get chatting with the dude next to me
Turns out he's a Polish construction worker from Manchester England (had the craziest accent)
He was vacationing with his missus but she got food poisoning so she's out of commission
Then he asks me if I want to know his secret to not getting food poisoning
Swears by it
Sure
Shoot
He drinks a pint
A PINT

Kills the germs apparently
Sweden, Switzerland, Austria, Australia ... all the same anyway
I wonder how many Americans think that Europe is still stuck in medieval times
this is the funniest one
Yeah just recently I found a thread on reddit talking about Swedish gun laws
Turns out they meant Swiss
tbf I meet a lot of Europeans that have a similar attitude towards South America/Asia
I dont remember the details of the conversation but the shocking part is that they didn‘t really know what Mohammed was
Meanwhile the French insist you greet them in their local language even if you don't speak French
In other words
different cultures
Different expectations

These are the relevant articles about self-defense and defense of others from the Swiss Penal Code:
>[**Legitimate self-defence**]
>[Art
15]
>If any person is unlawfully attacked or threatened with imminent attack, the person attacked and any other person are entitled to ward off the attack by means that are reasonable in the circumstances
>[**Mitigatory self-defence**]
>[Art
16]
>1 If a person in defending himself exceeds the limits of self-defence as defined in Article 15 and in doing so commits an offence, the court shall reduce the sentence
>2 If a person in defending himself exceeds the limits of self-defence as a result of excusable excitement or panic in reaction to the attack, he does not commit an offence
>[**Legitimate act in a situation of necessity**]
>[Art
17]
>Any person who carries out an act that carries a criminal penalty in order to save a legal interest of his own or of another from immediate and not otherwise avertable danger, acts lawfully if by doing so he safeguards interests of higher value
>[**Mitigatory act in a situation of necessity**]
>[Art
18]
>1 Any person who carries out an act that carries a criminal penalty in order to save himself or another from immediate and not otherwise avertable danger to life or limb, freedom, honour, property or other interests of high value shall receive a reduced penalty if he could reasonably have been expected to abandon the endangered interest
>2 If the person concerned could not have been reasonably expected to abandon the endangered interest, he does not commit an offence
Basically you can use whatever means you deem necessary to defend yourself, be it a gun or a knife for instance, and you will either be completely fine or get a reduced sentence for going too far in the eyes of the judge as it is all about *reasonable means
* An old lady blasting a big scary guy with a shotgun would be fine versus the opposite
However as carry licenses are almost impossible to get, if you're being attacked outside of your home you won't have a gun to return the courtesy
You can still have pepper spray or knives on you though, and it's perfectly legal to have a loaded gun at home
Each Canton (=federal subdivision of Switzerland) has it's own Police force (Kantonspolizei), big cities may have an additional Police (Stadtpolizei)
There's also a federal police (fedpol), but as far as I understood they mostly just coordinate between the various cantonal police forces whenever that's necessary
Uniforms, cars, equipment etc
therefore all varies from Canton to Canton
There is also military police, but they are a branch of the armed forces and don't interact with the civilian population (their job is to guard bases, escort ammunition transports, and investigate crime within the military)
They also don't wear police style uniforms but military style uniforms
It's very rare to see military police (unless during military service)
To add another thing to the confusion: some rural areas have a joined police force as well
It's on the same hierarchy level as the city police (stadtpolizei) but over a region thus called the regional police (regionalpolizei)
And some bigger cities don't have a city police but rather only the cantonal police
Concerning the military: While on duty the normal police doesn't really apply to you
They'll just hold you and wait for the military police to show up if necessary
As a civilian it's the other way around as well of course
In cases of emergency, like this pandemic, the military can support civil authorities after their request for assistance was signed off
This lead to military police supporting the border patrol and thus "switching sides" to the civil counterpart for the day
Everything in Italy reminds me of Greece pre crisis
Omg I really love the story about aujourd'hui
I can't believe I've studied French at school for like 8 years and never noticed this
Now that you say it, it's so obvious haha
In Swiss, a rather interesting word is "putsch". It's one of the very, very few Swiss words that have made it as loanword into English and have thus become globally used
It means more or less the same as the French "coup d'état", which is also used in English
What makes "putsch" an interesting word is that it goes back to a very specific event, namely the [Züriputsch] of September 6, 1839
At the time, the city of Zurich also had a lot of political power over the Canton of Zurich (small villages didn't receive proper representation)
Zurich was governed by very liberal politicians
This enraged the villagers in the rest of the Canton, which was mostly rural and very conservative
Tensions came to a boiling point when the liberals in Zurich appointed a controversial (and liberal) theologian to the theology faculty of the University of Zurich
The conservative citizens of the Canton of Zurich outside of the city saw this as an attempt to destroy the traditional order, so they marched into the city and tried to topple the liberal government
There were several battles between Cantonal troops and rampaging villagers
Originally, the Swiss verb "putschen" meant something like "to push", "to shove (aside)" or "to thrust". After the Züriputsch, which made international headlines at the time, the word entered the German language as a political term ("to thrust aside a government", i.e. to stage a coup d'état)
During WWI, the word was then picked up by British soldiers because the Germans used "putschen" also as a way of describing the act of thrusting out of the trenches to defeat the enemy in a forceful, punch-like manner
In standard German, there are now derivative words such as "aufputschen", which means "to stimulate" or "to excite" (for example when you drink an energy drink)
This term also goes back to the original Swiss "putschen" but the meaning of pushing or thrusting is more figurative here, in the sense of pushing yourself or thrusting yourself forward
If it weren't for a bunch of angry villagers in the 19th century, this derivative words would not exist today ;-)
The word “nostalgia”, an expression proposed in the 17th century in a medical context to describe the mental condition/anxiety displayed by Swiss mercenaries fighting away from home
Only later it has been used in a more general context
I thought it’s the ache/pain (álgos) of homecoming (nóstos)
Either way, I always thought it’s somewhat funny how this was classified as a real medical condition
You finish mandatory school at 16 and most people (about two thirds) then do an apprenticeship and enter the workforce
The other third pursues some sort of additional school, there are **many** options, some of them qualify you for University
The standard way to go to University is to do the Gymnasium (that's a school nothing to do with sports), after 3 years at the end of the Gymnasium you get the Matura (lit
Translation: Certificate of Maturity)
With the Matura you can go and study at any Swiss university in any subject, they have to accept you without any further entry exam (except for medicine)
If you went through the entire school system without repeating a year you'll get your Matura at 19
Since Switzerland has mandatory service for male citizens most male students will take a year between the Matura and starting to study to complete their service (contrary to popular belief this need not be military service, civilian options are available and popular)
Most of my female friends also took a "gap-year" between the Matura and studying, they either spent it working or traveling (or both)
So most people start university at around 20 years old
I started uni at 19 after 4 years of Gymnasium
And I went to the Gymnasium after two years of secondary school
I guess it varies in different cantons
You're right
The details definitely vary from Canton to Canton
But it's roughly the same (especially total duration), I also finished my Matura at 19 and started University a year later to have time for military service
Did you do a gap year between Matura asd starting at Uni
Yes, in my Canton it was 4 years of secondary school followed by 4 years until matura (it was actually changed shortly before I started the Gymnasium from 3
5 years to 4 and today you start secondary school a year later so you only have 3 years of that)
(also I lived in canton Solothurn but went to school in Baselland for secondary and gymnasium, so it's extra weird in my case)
No, I started uni right away
Since I'm female, I didn't have to do military service, and I wasn't really interested in a gap year
Total duration varies as well
Aargau and Basel have one year longer than most other cantons
So a male (after military) from aargau is roughly 2 years older than a female from st
Gallen
In my canton you could choose if you wanted to go after two or three years of secondary school
If you didn't pass the exam in the second year, you could alse retake it in the third
The differences between cantons are wild
I had to take an exam in grade 5 (primary school) to qualify for going to the progymnasium (sek p)
Yes, there's also Langzeitgymnasium that takes 6 years, instead of secondary school and Kurzzeitgymnasium
I don't know a lot of people personally who did that though
Many city names in my area end in -wil, which comes from the term ("wyler", German "Weiler") for a small collection of houses
Zug - comes from the oldgerman word for "to pull" mostly in connection with fishing(pulling out nets)
So basically a place where one goes to fish
As it was probably named by people from an older settlement near by
Another fun one is the places containing -thur or -thurn which derives from celtic "dur" river/water (Winter**thur** , Solo**thurn** , **Thur**gau) I think it's quite cool that the names for these places are that old (literally pre-roman)
Is that the same Wyler as in Bern Wylerfeld
There are of course some more such toponyms
On the online platform of the Historical Lexicon of Switzerland there is a [short article] about them
Also in the Idiotikon you can find articles about it, for example [here] It is also interesting how these toponyms are distributed within the country, you can find out on [ortsnamen
ch]
Imo, the story around "-iacum" is particularly exciting
This addition is celtic-roman and was used to make a claim of ownership (of a roman) in the place-name
But this "-iacum" has changed in different ways depending on the region: In German-speaking countries it became "-ach" (e.g. Zurzach), in French-speaking countries it became "-y", "-iez", "-ier" (e.g. Henniez) and in Italian-speaking countries it became "-ago" (e.g. Brissago)
The breed Rottweiler originated in Rottweil, Germany
"-weil" being the German equivalent of the Swiss German/Alemannic "-wil"/"-wyl".
Probably, yes
"meadow/field near or at the settlement"
You can listen to the local pronunciation [here] (courtesy of Wikipedia)
You just summoned Charli XCX with that comment
ETH Zurich
ETH
University of Lausanne, which is more social studies/natural sciences focused; or ETH Zürich, which is more polytechnic
It exists in Switzerland
But it's mostly to round up / 1CHF
If it was an excellent service you'd pay more
Oh absolutely, high German is what we (Swiss German speakers) learn in school and what we generally switch to when speaking German with anyone else who is not Swiss (or not from the German-speaking part of Switzerland)
It can also be quite annoying for people who look "foreign", for example an ethnic tamil girl I know always gets addressed in High German or even English when asked for the ticket in the train
(when the ticket-checker was just speaking Swiss-German to everyone white on the train, and just switched to French or High German when the addressee did not understand the Swiss German
So Swiss German is, at least in my opinion, a different language than Standard German
As we're all fluent in Standard German as well though I'll only speak Standard German when in Germany, Austria and so forth
Kn Switzerland however, I'll speak Swiss German to anybody
If they struggle I'll switch over to Standard German or English (I prefer the latter if the Person struggles with German in general)
For my job I have to call different people quite frequently and after introducing I'll pick one of those 3 languages, whatever works best for the situation
Funny thing is though that some Germans (when I'm in Germany) can't properly identify my noticably Swiss accent while speaking Standard German and they switch to (often somewhat broken) English
So yeah, switching to Standard German is pretty easy, I do it quite often with strangers but very rarely with people I know
Feel free to ask though
In French speaking parts I try my best in French but the conversation often switches to English or a strange mixture of both
But the question is
Do Austrians understand the Swiss better than the Germans do
To be precise the official standard language is Swiss Standard German and not German Standard German, so just like with Austrian Standard German, it will sound different
Yeah but those are differences like 'Reservation' for Swiss German and 'Reservierung' for the normal German
I think the other person meant that the Swiss often mix Swiss pronounciation with German and that makes it difficult to understand (like the famous violent ch/k sounds)
Welp most linguists think standards are bullshit anyway
Also in my experience the hard ch/k sounds is something you rather find on older people, most swiss have an accent but keep those sounds in check
I legit cant come up with a swiss dumpling
I even asked my girlfriend and she is a chef
Maybe im dumb and missing something
but at the moment
I got nothing
Same cant think of anything
Which only makes it more beautiful
Also it's not only us who have bittersweet words like that
Switzerland (my family moved here from Germany)
It definitly has it's downsides, but if you ever heard a Swiss person saying "we aren't that rich because our costs of living are higher" they are lying/lacking perspective
I recently read a comment here where a Swiss person said you couldn't buy anything for 1 CHF or maybe a small piece of candy
You can eat for a day for 1 CHF if you know what to buy
But most simply do not need that, they can easily spend 200 CHF every week for food, pay all their bills and still have more than 2'000 CHF left
And all of that with a less than average wage (my own situation right now)
Also it is incredibly beautiful
Pretty much anywhere you can see huge mountains on the skyline
And that's all I personally need
Financial safety and a beautiful country
Makes you forget how ridiculously and unhealthily conservative some places/people here are
> You can eat for a day for 1 CHF if you know what to buy
Such as
i’d probably keep my swiss one
Yes and I want a pretty blue one with 12 golden stars on it :)
Would definitly want to keep my swiss one, i dont have a "european" identity like 90% of people on  european subs
Lets just hope that never happens
I'd have thought that border control agents would be able to see this kind of information on their screen when they're scanning the passport
I mean its a hypothetical question so he can anwser it anyway
Me neither when travelling between Schengen countries
But just recently I've had a flight from Asia back to Switzerland with transit in Frankfurt
Therefore, I had to go trough passport control in Germany and not in Switzerland
No clue about standard German, we had a version in Bernese dialect though, even though I'm not from Bern
Spelling is horrible cuz idk how to spell this dialect
Chopf u schutere, füess, chnü u füess
(2x)
Ung ouge, ohre, muu u nase
Chopf u schutere, füess, chnü u füess
As you can see, the first 'knees' is skipped because otherwise it doesn't work with the syllables
In Switzerland we learned the german version but prefered the french one in school
The words fit better in the melody in french i think
don‘t know much about the FETO stuff but I‘m still going for the inside job explanation for the coup attempt
just look at how he used the state of emergency to lock up basically everyone who is against him
i dont think the turkish state cares much about the deaths since they can now use them as martyrs
American in Switzerland
Work/Life balance here is ridiculously better compared to the U.S (I joke with my friends back in the U.S that everyday is Friday here)
It's 100% a cultural thing as I wouldn't say Americans are working "harder". They just work more for no reason other than it being cultural
However, there are some big caveats, and that being that if you're very ambitious I think you're better off staying in North America
From my experience "climbing the corporate ladder" is an extremely slow process here compared to the U.S.
So it really depends on what you want to achieve to be honest
Fellow parent of twins here
I'm so envious of the Norwegian model
Twin parent friends of ours are also Norwegian and the dad was able to be so involved (early on) because of the great paternity leave in Norway

[Serious] Have you ever lived outside of your home country
It's one of those things that you have to experience first hand to fully understand
It's not always about the quality or the food itself but what it symbolizes
Like why watching media content in your mother tongue is important (very easy now with the internet)
That's awesome and glad to hear people are understanding about the situation involving multiples
In Switzerland women get a standard 4 months
But a lot of women tweak the system and get more (some justified/some not)
I don't understand the infatuation with a 13th salary
It's the same salary cut 13 ways instead of 12
I'm in the opinion that I'd rather have a larger pay check each month
Am I missing something
Oddly this comment sort of summarizes the attitudes between Europeans and Americans when it comes to work/what can be achieved through one's work
I have two friends (one in the U.S/one in an EU country) that have started their own brewing companies
The one in the U.S was able to find countless bars and shops that were willing to offer his beers
The one in Europe runs into a crazy amount of bureaucracy or resistance
He says he's about to give up
As a consumer I'd far prefer letting the market decide
But maybe that's just a very American mentality of mine
It's a difference in cultures
A French person might be critical as to why Americans need 35 types of hot sauces in a supermarket, and an American might look at a French supermarket Cheese section and wonder why they need that many
It's important in the context of the food culture of said person
Highly doubt anything of that sort will change anytime in the near future
Read up on women's rights in Switzerland
Surprisingly backwards/archaic compared to the rest of the continent
>Also, saying "I don't get the infatuation with extra money" is a little weird, lol
Because it's not extra money
Let's say you negotiate an annual salary of 120,000 EUR a year
With no 13th salary you get 10,000 EUR a month
With a 13th salary you get 9,230
7 EUR a month from January to November, but get 18,461 EUR in December
You're still getting the same amount at the end of the year
You're not getting an extra 10K because you get paid a 13th salary
My point is that I'd rather get the extra 769 EUR a month and get rid of a 13th salary
Unless you negotiate jobs by a monthly salary where you are
According to the Federal Statistical Office, households spent 632 Swiss Francs per month on food and non-alcoholic beverages in 2016
At an average household size of 2
24 persons, that's about 260 € per person
578 CHF per household
I mean if I could afford it that’s what I would do
Never cook and always eat out or get a delivery
If you can afford that that’s pretty cool, you shouldn’t feel bad
I don’t know what this ranking includes to calculate the cost, but I think it probably accounts for rent and housing, which is still much more expensive in Paris than in Swiss cities
However I feel like it doesn’t include other costs such as healthcare, taxes, phone, television and internet bills among others, that are more expensive in Switzerland
All things considered it’s clear that cities like Zürich or Geneva are more expensive than Paris
But some criteria are maybe not always specific to a certain city, so they might not be relevant enough
I hope that one day you guys will be
Hey ... We couldn't really do anything else tbh
Also, we did shoot down aircrafts violating our airspace
It is a good thing as that shows that we didn't just sit around and did nothing
We were scared but were still fighting
Our official policy of the military was never surrender and the message to the civilians stated that Switzerland will never surrender, and anyone stating otherwise is spreading enemy propaganda
*I* think it's a good thing
Also, Switzerland would've just been more work to free for the allies if we intervened, not mentioning the strong stance of neutrality
Belgium and Netherlands got attacked, they didn't choose to abandon neutrality
We did what we had to do to stay neutral, that includes securing the airspace
That was war, it wasn't in peacetime like in Russia, aswell as air travel being nonexistent back then
I know the question isn’t asked to us Swiss, but here’s my take anyway
I believe voting rights are the pendant of paying your taxes
Where you pay you can vote
You give your money to the government, and in exchange you get to choose this governement
And the other way around
I disagree
Voting has consequences, and I think if you want to get a say, you can obtain citizenship
In my opinion, anyone should be able to vote who can prove that he/she is integrated to a certain degree in a place or area, knows the local culture and its needs, is himself/herself clearly affected by possible changes through voting and actively informs himself/herself about all arguments of political problems
There may also be other prerequisites
This would include a few "official foreigners", but might also exclude a few compatriots
In any case, especially with regard to voting "Abstimmungen", I think that would make sense, but it would be quite impossible to implement
Chasch nid s Föifi und s Weggli haa

Usem Lächli gits es Bächli (from the laughter comes a brook
Not sure about the last Word, hat to use Google translate)
Usually said to children when they are being rowdy, because wery often someone ends up crying
Not really common, but one of my faves from my grandma :)
Well that happens to me too if I go to Germany, especially if you're in the city
The funny thing is though that I'm Swiss, speak native Swiss German and thus have a bit of an accent speaking standard German
I understand Standard German perfectly
I speak it perfectly besides the accent
And still most people (baristas, servers, hotel staff etc) switch immediately to English with me
Is pretty fun though and if it makes them feel good then let's continue in English, doesn't matter to me
There is a road near me that crosses the Swiss/French border 9 times in 38 kilometers

You had me in the first half, not gonna lie
I have a sweater on, but I'm good
It's kind of winter, so I don't expect to be hot
Probably quite exactly 19°C. It is cool, but not too cold
But it may be a little too low to work
19° C in my bedroom which isn't cold for this room
The heating isn't really working properly
Is a bit annoying since my desk is here too so I have to use one of these radiators you can plug in when I feel like it's too cold
The EEA is open to members of either the EU or EFTA
EFTA however is legally incompatible with customs unions with non-EFTA states, so you legally cannot be both in the EEA and have a customs union with the EU (or be a member of the EUCU), unless the country is an actual EU member
The EEA Agreement abolishes tariffs between it's members
I like the Rumantsch word «chillvosa», a word creation from the English loanword «chill» ("to relax") and the Rumantsch word for beer «gervosa».
Per favore no

Very walkable
Lived here for all my life and never have I ever heard of any crime (robbery etc
) taking place here (in my area)
I tend to go for late night walks in Zürich quite often
Ranging from 10pm to 3am
So far never had any issues, usually if someone stops me to talk it's just to ask for a cigarette
I do dress in a hoodie/cap and pretty dark usually and am male so this might influence it a bit
Not scary looking but not extremely approachable either
There are places where I would feel a bit uneasy due to drunk people/teens hanging out in groups, however that's more of a being aware of my surroundings than a real danger to me
I know people who have been robbed or in a fight but that's outside of clubs, not in random streets at midnight
So all in all I guess it's pretty much perfectly safe
It's even pretty safe in the 'more wicked areas' of the largest cities
[the Alphorn]
I’ve even got a group of guys who meets up every week about a 2km away from my house to play alphorn together so my Tuesday evenings are wonderful
*my friend who lives on the other side of town also enjoys listening to them from his balcony*

I swear the Alphorn being reinterpreted as a giant bong or joint is an absolutely unavoidable occurrence in Swiss middle school life

How are people supposed to guess which of 40+ european countries you are from
There's free water in most big cities in Europe
Just an example:
Yeah, that's fair
But if you're not interested in continent x or country y then don't pretend you can talk about them and know what you're talking about
Yeah
You just have to ask for tap water and it is indeed free at cafés and restaurants
Some places might require you to order something with it though
But water fountains are literally everywhere and they are ideal if you have a bottle you want to refill
Lucerne
beautiful city because its located at the foot of the alpes and at a lake, but there are so many tourists there it's crazy
how to avoid them: don't go there
I’m gonna be honest, there are almost no scams I am aware of here in Switzerland
But you should be cautious about following what travel blogs, influencers  etc
recommend
You’ll just end up in Grindelwald and Lauterbrunnen like every other idiot, when in fact there are other beautiful places to see
I think Grindelwald and Lauterbrunnen are magnificent, but overrun, so less enjoyable

Pro: Great education, stable politics, pretty safe
High wages
Con: everything expensive as fuck
No matter what other country I go to everything is cheaper there (which is nice for vacation though)
pros: great infrastructure, high standard of living, good politics

probably the 1868 floods

I would argue it’s the earthquake in Basel in 1356
The Basel earthquake also came to mind:
"The 1356 Basel earthquake is the most significant seismological event to have occurred in Central Europe in recorded history and had a moment magnitude in the range of 6
0–7
1 The town within the ramparts was destroyed by a fire when torches and candles falling to the floor set the wooden houses ablaze
The number of deaths within the town of Basel alone is estimated at 300
All major churches and castles within a 30 km (19 mi) radius of Basel were destroyed

Kind of an odd example but many people assume Milka chocolate is Swiss
It’s not, and it’s not even being sold here
Lidl has it, but it’s kind of a « German supermarket in Switzerland
There is nowhere to go where there isn't people
Everything is full of people
Boarding a train or a tram
Full of people
Driving on the road
Full of people in cars
Looking for an apartment
Lots and lots of people, sometimes hundreds
Going to buy food
Migros is full of fucking people
Hike six hours up a remote mountain
Meet people every 5 fucking minutes, and when you reach the top, bam, hundreds of people
The population is growing one medium-large sized city per year, every year
Imagine if in Germany, a new Cologne popped up every year
Year after year after year, a new Cologne is added
It won't be long until even such a large country is starting to feel pretty full
There isn't enough land and there isn't enough infrastructure, and there is no way to keep up with people because there is no land
Fucking people
They're everywhere
Including myself of course
Cost of childcare is probably the highest in Europe (and even maybe the world)
So Pepe Le Pew is closer to reality than we thought
Maybe it’s because I simply don’t buy that often online, but I never really faced that problem
Maybe it’s also more specific to Norway
> we should get about 90% of the Swiss wages
Why
Your cost of living is less than half of ours
Having doube the salary does not equal double the money when comparing Germany to Switzerland
I don’t know where you live in our country, but that has never been a major problem for me
I live in the city center of Lausanne and study in Geneva so I’m around people a lot
While I often notice crowds, it’s always because it’s rush hour
Take the train between Lausanne and Geneva at 7am ? Not an empty seat
Take it at 1pm ? Empty seats everywhere
Same in the streets
Wanna go in town on Satudray
People everywhere
On a Sunday
The city (especially Geneva) is completely empty, looks like a ghost town
But it’s not specific to Switzerland, I’ve seen that happen in pretty much every country I’ve ever visited
When I came back from Japan, Lausanne felt eerily quiet and empty
Honestly surprised people didn't get the joke
In my experience, more a problem to Norway I'd say
Switzerland is most of the times included or just straight up isn't.
What is annoying is Amazon's decisions last few years of limiting delivery to here :I
Our prices are also double of yours, sometimes more
I wish you the best of luck
> it hasn't adjusted to it's neighbours
Buy power is still very similar compared to our neighbours, what's the problem
Your image of Switzerland seems very idealized, and wrongfully so in my opinion
Lots of Swiss people struggle to make ends meet despite their good salary, because the cost of life is so high
You’re only thinking of skilled or long-time employed workers
For what would be minimum-wage workers, life is tough like everywhere else
In your taxes health insurance and state pensions are included, and that health insurance includes dentistry
In our taxes, there is no pension, and no health insurance
The health insurance costs between 3000 and 6000 Euro per year and doesn't include dentistry
Even a minor dental correction costs 10'000 Euro
When you include health insurance and pension into our taxes, it turns out you don't really pay more but you get dental insurance
And then there's rent, which is 2x to 4x of yours, and food, which is 2x yours
Smart people do it like this:
Work in Switzerland (Basel)
Shop in Germany
Life in France/Elsass
> I'm not sure what you mean about pensions not being included for you
Everything I can find via google says you definitely have state funded retirement
Our pension system has three pillars, I don't want to get into explaining that right now
What's relevant for this discussion is: When you google "how much taxes do Swiss pay" the pensions we have to pay are not included in the amount the google results tell you
It is paid separately, when for you it is included in your tax bill
Either you need to subtract pension and health insurance payments from the German tax burden, or, you need to add our three pension systems' amounts plus health insurance to the Swiss tax burden
Then they're somewhat comparable
You'll discover that we both pay something between 10 and 50%, depending on income
> As for rent: Apparently, in Switzerland you pay 190CH per m² per year on average
Average rent is not a good indicator, not for Germany and not for Switzerland, because there are vast differences in price between Hinterfotzigen am Kaff and Berlin Mitte
In reality, it probably ranges 150-800 Euro for a single bedroom apartment in Germany while the range for us is 900-2500 Fr
Probably Bern (Sports fans not included)
It's very cultural, has a beautiful old town, people are friendly and chill and their dialect is kinda cute
Bern or somewhere in Ticino I’d say
I never hear anything mean about Ticino and the place is in my opinion one of the most beautiful in Switzerland

I think that they are sometimes seen as German intruders here
We have our own supermarkets, we don't need them
What I think makes them distinctively non-Swiss is them having prices like 2
49 Fr
which isn't possible because the smallest coin is 0
05 Fr
and that has been the case for over 50 years and nobody puts up dumb prices like that
But our local supermarkets like Migros or Coop are also a lot nicer than Lidl, or also Aldi, for that matter
In fact, I'd be hard pressed to name a popular chain that's more budget oriented than Lidl, even though they improved their image significantly in the past few years
It was founded August 1st 1291 as a country
The federal state as we know it today exists since 1848
729 years
In 1291 three guys went to a field and said "Fuck Austria, we're Switzerland now"
>August 1st 1291
Actually no but that's what we like to say to ourselves
The day was basically picked at random
&#x200B;
More info:
>The Swiss National Day refers to the Federal Pact (1291), the founding act of the Confederation concluded by the representatives of the three original cantons: Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden (which later divided into two half-cantons: Obwalden and Nidwalden)
This original document in Latin was only rediscovered by chance in the 18th century during an inventory of the archives of Schwyz
Before then, the Pact of 1315 was considered the founding text
>In the Middle Ages, there was no national holiday; local commemorations of battles and deaths were celebrated, but no common events
>With the federal state of 1848 and with the aim of consolidating the confederal links between the cantons, all parties and denominational tendencies, the need arose to create a unifying event
>On 14 December 1889, the Federal Council proposed the organisation of a major celebration in all the cantons and particularly in Bern, where the Confederation's birthday would be combined with the 700th anniversary of the federal city
However, the people of Schwyz thought that the main celebration should take place in Brunnen, the place where, in their opinion, the signing of the pact of 1291 took place, which they proposed
The Swiss Federal Assembly agrees and decides to let Schwyz organise the festival in early Switzerland
>The first festival lasted two days, 1 and 2 August 1891
Official Switzerland gathers on 1 August for a large theatrical performance in Schwyz with 960 extras representing the whole of Swiss history with tableaux vivants and patriotic songs
The second part, on 2 August, at the Grütli is a more moving part with the cantata of Tell, a boat trip and illumination of the surrounding peaks with lights
On the other hand, for the cantonal, local and Swiss abroad celebrations, a minimum common programme is laid down: 1st August "Ringing of all the bells at 7 p.m. and bonfires on the heights" and for 2nd August "Divine Service with speeches and patriotic character", any other event is left to the discretion of the cantons and communes
The Swiss colony of Paris organizes a grandiose festival whose date is brought forward to July 12, 1891
>The national holiday of 1891 was planned as a single event
Under pressure from the Swiss abroad, annual celebrations began in 1899
>The 1st of August has been an official holiday throughout Switzerland only since 1994
Until then, 1 August was almost everywhere a working day, only a few cantons (Zurich, Schaffhausen and Ticino) considered it as a legal holiday, while others considered it only a "half day" public holiday
The popular initiative "For a national holiday" was launched in 1991, on the 700th anniversary of the founding of the Swiss Confederation, to make 1 August a public holiday throughout Switzerland
The initiative was accepted by a vote on 26 September 1993
correct:)
Depends on what you consider the foundation of the country
The Westphalia Treaty was merely a *de jure* recognization of Switzerland's independence after years of *de facto* independence
1291 was when Uri, Schwytz and Unterwald made a pact to break free from the Hapsburg which started a series of alliances creating Switzerland (Confederation of Three, Eight, Ten and Thirteen)
The Confederation of Thirteen was to one being *de jure* recognized in the Westphalia Treaty
In Switzerland
+ Lots of "man with a van/truck" services available
+ You can rent a large van by hour/kilometer
+ Delivery
We have very heavy or bulky items delivered
Everything else we transport by public transport
My family has not had a car at all for years
This 'tradition' has been taken over by my girlfriend and me
There have been no situations where we would absolutely need a car
If it would come to it, however, we could certainly ask friends or rent one
Without a car/truck there are basically only very few limitations for us, e.g. it might be a bit difficult to pick up a used sofa at someone's house (although I have transported sofas by public transport)
Ask around group of closest friends or facebook
Rent a Mobility van (Swiss carsharing service)
Pay for a delivery service
Or you can peer pressure your mate who learned a trade into helping you with his company car
Des zones tampons
Not sure about other cantons but we had mandatory cooking lessons in school
Not only cooking but also learning about nutrition, vitamins etc
Same here, except that 99% went home to eat
I think it should be a requirement but the setup is a bit hypocritical if we're honest
In the sense of those who inherit citizenships from their parents/grandparents but never lived/learned the language don't have to go through this requirement (legally)
I know loads of South Americans that hold Italian citizenship (and therefore work around the EU) but don't speak a word of Italian
Why were they not subjected to language requirements the way children of immigrants to Italy would be
When they never contributed (even in terms of taxes/local economy) to the country
If that makes sense
I dont know how all switzerland handles it but i am sure that there are at least 4 different language options (our 4 official languages)
I know Tina Turner had to learn some german for the test, but i have never heard her speak german, so i dont know how much of the language she knows
It annoys the fuck out of me
True
There should be a test for everybody
But in most countries the school system takes good care of that problem in my experience
For Switzerland itself I'd say learn 1 of the languages (meaning German, French or Italian of course), use English in the other parts or go the extra mile and learn that one too
Edit : No, I haven't forgotten Romansh, but it's 0
6% of the nation that speak it
At first I thought you had a stroke
Now I'm leaning towards "I don't give a fuck"
Why you would write a comment like it was a chatroom, is unknown to me, but hey, maybe I'm just too old
This was not the argument
It was according to citizenship, not about living there
Becoming part of society *is* also becoming a citizen of said society, in which you need to learn the language
Makes perfect sense
Don't get me wrong, I understand why jus sanguinis is valid
Just pointing out that there is a bit of hypocrisy in what one judges to be "integration".
Doesn't mean my scenario can't happen in Spain, and I'm sure it does
Disagree
I've met a lot of French people who I later find out have Spanish parents/grandparents, that don't speak any Spanish/Catalan/etc
Granted because of the EU they probably have no reason to get a Spanish passport but the point still stands
Yeah
Let's say there's a French guy that doesn't speak any Spanish but wants Spanish nationality
Turns out his grandmother was Spanish, he can basically get a Spanish passport much easier/quicker than say the Mexican immigrant that moved to Spain and has been/living working there for years and wants to get naturalized
In mine it was just throwing them in a warehouse to gather dust
It’s the same situation in Switzerland in many schools, most notably in the HES-SO network (university-level schools in multiple domains such as arts, management, etc
Except for copyrights, the school owns all intangible rights to the students' creations
I’m not an art student myself, but when my friends told me about it I found it quite shocking too
Wouldn‘t that be before, not behind
As in your summer starts a month earlier
Probably one of the reasons why people often mix up Sweden and Switzerland
8 minutes of walking, 12 minutes by bus, 70 minutes by train followed by another 8 to 10 minutes of walking
I take either a 22 minute bus ride or I drive and it takes 14 minutes
I can also do a mixed tram-bus route that is 18 minutes, but it requires some transfers and is a bit more active, so I usually just take the bus
I get up, ride my bike downhill, then through the city center, over the bridge, by the station and then the road continues by the lake for another 5 minutes
Total time 15‘
Before i go downhill i drive straight towards the mountains and it‘s so fucking beautiful
pretty short, even though I live in the countryside, it's close to the cities
everything in Switzerland is close
Amazing
It’s like Boaty McBoatface, olden days-style
If you go for a walk in a place where there aren't a lot of people and it's somewhat nice you will find Swiss people
Has happened to me in France and Austria
It really surprised me that there is a swiss german langue pack in Minecraft
So, I'm speaking Swiss German and Austrian and i think it was in Seattle, where there was just a huge Graffiti on a Wall saying "Fotzegrind" which is Swiss German for Dickhead (Though it would translate to cunthead)
The other one was when i was in Nice, France and there was written "Oachkatzlschwoaf" which is Austrian for Squirrel Tail and because it's pronunciation is so difficult Austrians often tend to convince foreigners to try to say it so they can laigh their ass of :P
Also, though not tooooo suprising, in Mannheim, Germany i saw the word "Chuchichäschtli" on a toilet which is Swiss German for Kitchen Cupboard and just like Austrians with the previously mentioned word, we try to tell it to foreigners to pronounce it, just to laugh our ass of, that's kind of what we guys with German dialects do
Love the language pack
Its hilarious
People living in the mountains
5 of the 8 million people live in the "flat lands" that only make up 30% of the whole country
Eating Fondue and being able to jodle
- Cheese eaters
- Cows
- Mountains (To be honest there are still many mountains here, but sure not as many as some people think)
And there go my vacation plans for the summer
That's because like at least half of the OG bands are Norwegian
And the crazy stuff that happened in the 90's (Euronymous being murdered, nazis, church burnings) happened there
And there's that one guy called Fenris in Darkthrone who became a mayor or something even though he didn't really want to be it
His election poster was him holding his cat lmao
I always say there are only hills, no mountains
Most under 500m, some maybe around 800m. But certainly not like the Netherlands
Edit: if you want you can google "Zürich Unterland Foto" this gives you an idea
Not living in the flat lands doesn't mean living in the mountains
There are areas that are close to the mountains but not IN the mountains
Lucerne for example
alrighty
Ah, I see you are a (wo)man of culture as well
Love it, also in about every somewhat big store (at least in my area)
Actually this is quite common in Switzerland
Truly
There are a lot of delicious desserts, but if I have to choose one, it's definitely Vermicelles
Cuckoo clocks were not invented in Switzerland (but Germany)
That we're rich because
a) we got all of the gold the Nazis stole
b) we're 99% banks that hoard illegal, untaxed money for rich people
In reality:
a) we got a few hundres million worth of Nazi stuff, nowhere near enough to make us rich, and on top of that we paid that amount back to Jewish communities several times over
b) our finance industry - the whole industry, that includes insurances and whatnot, not just banks - accounts for less than 3% of our GDP
We're successful because of a multitude of factors
If all it took to ve a rich nation were just being neutral and hiding rich people's money then everyone would be doing it
You spelled "rabbit" wrong
Mostly services (>70%), as any developed country

Tokyo, Kyoto, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Kobe, Sapporo, Fujiyama(?),
Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, Kyoto, Nara, Kanazawa, Kamakura and Shirakawa-go (a village not a city, does it still count
) as they’re the cities I visited
Off the top of my head I can also name Yokohama, Sendai, Nagasaki, Hiroshima, Kobe, Sapporo, Fukushima and I believe there’s a city named Okinawa on the island ? Not sure
And I have already learned that Hokkaido is an island, not a city
Oops
Now I'm ashamed as a fellow Swiss because I'd at most could've said Nagasaki, Tokyo, Fukushima and Hiroshima
Did you travel to Japan once or twice

That's like the 5th time I've seen your name)

As far as I know it’s not a thing here in Switzerland either
Switzerland was one of the founding countries of the EEA
In the end we did not even join, but it’s one of the countries that pushed for it’s creation
Aside from maybe the Fröntler (sympathizers of Nazi Germany during the 1930s and 1940s), Switzerland doesn't have any actual traitors in its history to my knowledge
**However**, we do have several people who were/are **considered** to be traitors by our political authorities
Here are the three most famous ones:
- [**Paul Grüninger**] was a Swiss border patrol officer during the late 1930s. He is credited with saving the lives of roughly 3,600 Jewish refugees by secretly pre-dating their visas
By 1938, Switzerland had closed down all borders and didn't let anyone enter the country anymore
Grüninger knew that these Jewish families would be sent to cocentration camps and he was unwilling to accept this
By making it look as though the entry visas had been issued a long time ago, the Jewish refugees could enter the coutry illegally
Despite Grüninger's bravery, altruism and heroism, his actions were considered deeply illegal at the time
When he was caught by his superiors in 1939, the government put him on trial for over 2 years
In the end, he was found guilty of betraying the country and his service
He was released from his duty without notice, forced to pay all trial costs and the court took away his entire pension
For the remaining 30 years of his life, Grüninger lived in poverty and ostracized by Swiss society
The federal government never properly apologized to him until his death in 1972 and his case was never re-opened
He wasn't given back any of his pension
Thanks to political propaganda, most Swiss people still viewed Grüninger as a traitor in the early 2000s. Despite all of this, he never regretted his actions and said in an interview in the 1950s that he would do everything the same if given another chance
It was only by the 2010s that he was finally rehabilitated
- [**Christoph Meili**] was another brave guy in charge of safety and security
In 1997, he was employed by the Swiss bank UBS as a night guard
During one of his lonely strolls through the deserted hallways and office spaces of the bank, he came across several large heaps of files that UBS employees had been instructed to destroy the next morning
As he was a little bored, curiosity got the better of him and he began to casually read through some of the files on top of the pile
What he saw there deeply shocked and troubled him
The files dated back all the way to WWII and they referred to orphanaged assets that had been owned by Jews and then been seized by the Nazis
The documents proved beyond a doubt that UBS had not only cooperated with the Nazis to rob the Jews but had also tried to gets its own greedy hands on the Jewish assets after the war
And now UBS was about to destroy all of this incriminating evidence
Christoph Meili immediately sat down, went through all the papers, sorted out the most important ones, made photo copies and took home these copies
A few days later he came forward as a whistleblower
Sadly, the authorities reacted very unkindly to his brave actions
They put him on trial and charged with with several crimes, including a violation of the banking secret
Faced with a long prison sentence, Meili took his family and together they escaped to the US where they received political asylum
- [**Rudolf Elmer**] used to be a banker at the private Swiss bank Julius Bär. In the early 2000s he became aware of numerous illegal activities that his bank was committing in the Cayman Islands for the purpose of tax evasion
He eventually came forward as a whistleblower by collecting evidence and giving it to Wikileaks
Neither his bank nor the Swiss authorities were happy about this
He was dismissed from his job and his career was pretty much destroyed
The Swiss government imprisoned him twice
Like Christoph Meili, he is currently one of the most vilified people in Switzerland
After his case became public, some politicians began to argue for stronger protections for whistleblowers but unfortunately not much has been done till this day
I'm also swiss, but that's the first time I heard of them
I assume it got swept under the rug pretty quickly
The government really doesn't want to talk about what happened during that time, understandibly so
As well as it being seen as "A thing that had to be done to secure our country" at that time, meaning he still risked our country during that time
It most likely also has to do with our half direct democracy being slow as fuck
(Not saying it's justified, just trying to find some possible reasons)
Good luck invading the longest standing neutral country with no reprucussions lol
Never heard of any of them, so I wouldn't say they're well known either way
I didn’t hear about it, what happened exactly ?
In Switzerland it is called ***Eidgenössisches Departement für Verteidigung, Bevölkerungsschutz und Sport (VBS)***, in French ***Département Fédéral de la Défense, de la Protection de la Population et des Sports (DDPS)***, in Italian ***Dipartimento Federale della Difesa, della Protezione della Popolazione e dello Sport (DDPS)***, in Romansh ***Departament Federal da Defensiun, da Protecziun da la Populaziun e Sport (DDPS)*** and in English ***Federal Department of Defense, Civil Protection and Sport (DDCP)*** and it is currently headed by Federal Council Viola Amherd of the Christian Democratic People's Party
Because essentially we decided that the promotion/advancement of physical exercise and various sports clubs should have a high enough priority in Switzerland that it should be among the core issues/duties that our Federal Council has to deal with
Now, the tricky part in Switzerland is that our Federal Council consists of 7 members and that's it
In other countries you can have a President or Prime Minister and a bunch of different ministries
If government duties grow over the years, you can simply add another ministry
For example in the US they've got like 15 different departments for all sorts of stuff
In Switzerland, that's not possible because the Federal Council is the executive branch
So, basically these 7 people need to deal with everything
Of course they can higher more staff in their respective departments but in the end, they're still the boss and the ones who have to oversee everything
So if new issues or duties come up, such as that of sports, we need to squeeze them in wherever they fit best
The thought process in this cases probably was something like: "well, soldiers do a lot of physical exercise, so the military and sports go well together". We have similarly exotic combinations on the Cantonal and municipal level
For example in my city we have a department for education and sports and another one for security and environment
So if you're the head of the department for security and environment, you're on the one hand dealing with the city's police force, crime and that sort of stuff but on the other hand also with questions such as "how can we make the city more green". It must seem quite odd from other countries' perspective ;-)

Meanwhile the dude next to me in the bus is wearing a Patek like it's no big deal
Because here in Switzerland (the land of luxury watches) it's really not a big deal
On a similar note
We were waiting for the bus once while it was raining and a lady casually rode her bike past us getting soaked by the rain
My wife freaked out because apparently she was wearing a 10K+ Hermes purse and letting it get wet
Most women we know would be putting that in 2 plastic bags and under their coats
We do that too
Horse meat I'm ok (though I'll try to avoid it)
But Horse meat tartare (raw) is where I draw the line
Not nude in Switzerland (even the Swiss German side), France, Italy in my experience
There are signs specifically outlining that you need to be clothed
And one time a hilarious sign asking Asian customers not to bring in salt
Awkward on how one of the most known tanks in WW 2 carries his name
Well, there also was the Bismarck on the German side, seeing as Bismarck also wasn't always great
This stuff wasn't covered in Extra History
Good to know I suppose
In before some idiot strolls along and believes this crap
I wouldn't put it past some people
Ouch
Well, speaking of killing dogs, the Wehrmacht killed a lot of them
Probably due to the fact the Soviets used them as anti tank weapons
They were actually quite effective, thus the reason to shoot any dog passing
Is it dumb if you make lots of money
(France) I’m gonna go with the [sabordage de Toulon] , when we scuttled almost our entire navy (77 ships sunk) in 1942 to prevent the nazis from taking it
To be fair it was only the second dumbest solution, close behind handing over an entire fleet to the germans, which would have turned the war in the mediterannean
If they had predicted the german commando attack on Toulon, they might have had the time to join forces with the british navy in North Africa
Don't worry
You are not alone
Germany is not the only country stupid enough to invade Russia in winter
Although we have been a regular federation since 1848, but just kept the old name (and of course back then confederation and federation weren't yet separate things)
Only from Civ4 onward
In Civ3 this trick worked probably exactly once, but everyone disliked you and refused to have open borders with you afterwards
It's not about when you start your invasion but when you end it
Tell that to the people that let the Russlandfeldzug start at least a month later than originally planned
Most invasions aren't won in a day
Of course, it might also have been dumb to even think to be able to win a war against Russia before winter breaks
But then maybe the war itself was a dumb idea and that was what OP was referring to and it was a dumb idea of mine to make a dumb joke about it
Liechtenstein
In a nice reversal of the usual design theirs are [white numbers on a black background]
I honestly also like the [Swiss ones] we've got the swiss flag on the left and the cantonal flag on the right (canton = federal subdivision of Switzerland), double the flags double the cool xD
Btw
while searching for the pictures I found [this website] with pictures of "almost all number plates of Europe" (at least according to the website itself)
AND did you know that the Liechtenstein licence plates appear white with black number when you illuminate them in the dark
That's really cool
I am so confused right now
The St
Gallen flag is older than any facist movement in Europe
Same in Switzerland
Damn I never made that connection
Guess it's just very normal for us to see that cantonal flag here and there
No offense but if I saw a Wolfsangel in Germany I wouldn't have the same reaction to it as seeing the flag of St
Gallen here in Switzerland
It's probably just our different perception of history and my age that make this kinda stuff easier to overlook
I would expect the awareness for such things is a lot higher in Germany than it is here
But it is certainly interesting how such symbols pretty much got abused for like 10 years by the nazis and many lost their initial meaning they represented for hundreds of years before
Fun related fact: The saying "jedem das Seine" is still somewhat common in some regions in Switzerland
I got a lot of bad looks when I dropped it in a hotel reception area in Germany once, only later realizing why the Germans weren't as friendly anymore suddenly
Affordable restaurants and street food
Fun and laid back people, also cheap stuff
I feel like I actually have money and don't have to spend half a fortune in everything, when I'm outside of Switzerland
Never would have thought this is not a thing in germany
Kebab: 9
40€ and some cheaper ones at 7
80€
Pizza takeaway: 9
40€ and in normal restaurants atleast 14€ .
Hamburger as a cheap example mcdonalds where the big mac menu is around 13
50 and only the burger for around 7€. Outside of Mc and BK Hamburgers arent really a street food
There are really good burger restaurants tough where you can easily pay more than 20€ just for one burger
Yeah it really isnt comparable, I also wasnt complaining just explaining it
Regular pizza in boxes
Al taglio isnt too common here but I cant confidentialy say the same about all of Switzerland
Yeah I actually don’t know where he found a pizza for 14€, as far as I know it usually costs around 19€. But meat here is very expensive so I think that’s why kebabs are disproportionnaly expensive
Maybe he meant only a slice or half a pizza
Because I don’t know where I can find a whole one for such prices
Pizzeria la Piccola in St
Gallen
Whole pizzas for 9
50CHF as a takeaway and 10CHF if you want to sit on a few bar tables
Well now I’m jealous, and I can’t even go to St
Gallen for a pizza
You treasure it
I was taught that when I learned to writw cursive in school
I actually thought the same, but I use it for small and caiptal z’s. I don’t really know where it comes from bc we were not taught that in school I think
It‘s been slowly fading out of my writing over the past few years now though because I had to learn how to do the „Neue Basisschrift“ (the new official way kids are taught how to write each letter) as part of becoming a teacher
I‘ve never seen it in print before though
Most people have one, some don't, some also have more than just two
Most people don't use their second names, some include them in their initials, a few people usually write both names
I know quite a few people who hate their middle name for some reason but I think their hate isn't justified in most cases
Parents are required to give their child a second name if the child's gender doesn't become obvious from the first name (e. g. Andrea)
Some families have naming traditions linked to middle names but those vary between families and most don't have traditions at all
I have my father's first name as middle name but that isn't a tradition in my family and my parents only did that because they wanted me to have one and they couldn't think of anything else because they were already kinda struggle to even find one name for me
Me and a lot of my friends have middle Names
We just don't tell many people
common and useless
One oddity (I really don't know much about American habits) is the contrast between a seemingly big need for 'home safety' (shotgun in the bedroom yada yada) but then you build front doors that a random punk can kick in
Good luck trying to kick in doors in Europe
The only thing you'll achieve is getting your foot broken
There's absolutely nothing here in Switzerland
Architects and urban planners seem to be confident about, that mastering a right angle and using enough cement makes up a good architecture
I don't think that a "Princess" could ever represent us, our entire foundation myth (yes, it absolutely is only a fictional myth) is about sticking it to feudal structures
According to those myths we're nothing but descendants of 13th century [rebels against the Austrian Royalty]
That all said: If Disney were to appropriate any Swiss story it'd probably be [Heidi] they'd probably give her a goat as a sidekick (or maybe a Saint Bernard - even though the Heidi story takes place in an entirely different region of Switzerland than where you'd find Sait Bernards) .
Edit: Typo
Any sidekick that isn’t a cow can get lost
Oh god
I hadn't even considered that, the horror
Pssst
We like to pretend that we forgot about that
As Maui sais to Moana: [If you wear a dress and you have an animal sidekick you are a princess
Rüeblifrässer sy sy gsy, diä Aargauer
not the winter war, but Finnish independence after ww1
I am reminded of the most recent one
SWISS GOVERNMENT DECLARES COFFEE NON-ESSENTIAL was the global headline
I even had friends from the USA email me about it
How could we declare coffee non-essential
Everyone loves coffee
How dare we do such a silly thing
We had weird people threatening to blow up Sweden, and questioning the law makers in Stockholm (and even a few naming Bern)
We had news people stating that this is craziness, and unhinged Americans threatening to shoot anyone who came for their coffee
The international news tied it to bank secrecy, nazi gold, CERN, Nestle scheming, UN pressures, direct democracy gone mad, and lots of other things
SWISS hate COFFEE
How dare they
Internet and world UNITE against this Helvetic madness
The reality of the situation was the Swiss government was debating if stockpiling coffee in the strategic reserve was a logical thing for the budget
The Swiss government maintain stockpiles if essential goods in case we are every blockaded during a war, which historically included coffee
Coffee is expensive, and although we all love it, you will not die from not having it
I mean really DIE, not be unhappy, DIE
For the same cost of maintaining rotation of coffee stock, we could store more food, water or medicine, things that you actually would DIE without
This was the debate
Should we keep a strategic coffee stockpile for a future blockade of Switzerland in a war, or not
It was not a referendum on if coffee is good, or if anyone should be drinking it, or banning coffee
It was another example of a Cold War program needing trimming as the chance of a blockade is small today
The [minarets referendum] issue
First of all, we get right-wing populist "appeals to gut-feeling" referenda like this *all the time*, most are defeated comfortably, and even if accepted (like this) their implementation is usually so watered down so as to not really be an issue any more
We know how to deal with this shit
And the minarets thing wasn't even that bad
It's a roof element for fuck's sake
We are mainly concerned with conserving our picturesque skylines rather than oppressing muslims
I saw many dozens of tweets from random Americans threatening to invade Switzerland over this
lol
It was weird at first, but the attention was deserved since to this day we still don’t know if the parents themselves might be culpable or not, after several witnesses incriminated the mother especially
If that is true, the whole media campaign to find madeleine was the biggest lie ever
> Supposedly Germany has it also
Switzerland has the same law
No one gets support form the state when they have things of value
Counts for refugees but also for citizens
But this situation was mainly blow up by UK media itself
And yes the story was constructed to hurt Corbyn and Labour
Have you seen the Al Jazeera Doc
about it
>No, do you have a link
Sure
please tell me what you think after watching it
> I'm wondering how many countries the Israeli government is covertly interfering in
They do it everywhere
All lobby-work
Here is a Swiss Politician (right wing)
-Oh he got invited to Isreal
-Oh he submited a motion against NGO's who help Palestine
There is also one about the lobby work in US-Politics
Taking the train and bus everywhere
Being annoyed at a minor delay in busses or trains
Being 15 minutes too early to *anything*.
I was riding the escalator and (as everyone should) standing on the right side so people could pass on the left
In front of me was someone standing on the left side so I started walking only to be able to say "excuse me" before passing them so they knew they had to stand on the right
This rule is sacred but as far as I know only in Zürich
Using public transport all the time, be frustrated because of minor delays, being frustrated because I was slightly late, eating cheese, eating chocolate
For me it was being annoyed at the train arriving 1 minute too late
Only happened once and it was a sheit day
Speaking Danish
Everyone else just laughs their asses of because of the language
>Being 15 minutes too early to anything
Wait, what
I thought I was being stereotypical by always arriving exactly on time
Even if it means actually arriving in the vicinity early, and then wasting time by walking around the area so can can then show up *exactly* on time
Also, if we were to meet up at 15:00, obviously everything from 15:00:00 to 15:00:59 is perfectly acceptable, so we're quite relaxed about the whole punctuality thing I'd say
"Oh hey, I'm a locksmith
You need help
What are you saying
15:00:01 is already the death sentence by our secret service EXIT
Nope, at least to my knowledge, but busses *sometimes* do
Trains always have to wait until the departure time has passed, like 1s after
So you better not stop running if you're running late or start walking as soon as you see the train
It **will** depart without you 9/10 times
I've seen it happen *once* in now 3 years of travelling by train daily that the train driver unlocked the doors again after somebody came up the stairs
**Then** the person missed the train because he was too stupid to realize that the doors were unlocked after he pressed the button once (they were locked on the first press, then unlocked half a sec later and unlocked for solid 5-10s)
Tried to run to him to open the door to him because he's an idiot, but didn't make it in time
Also known as speaking with a potato in your mouth
No, but random chance always exists
I am a dual citizen and do like the fact that there are no restrictions on that end from either of the two countries
I'm still surprised that this can be a somewhat controversial topic in some countries
Reading some of the replies in this thread, in an audience that overall is most likely more progressive than the average population, I'd argue that to some people it is somewhat controversial
That used to be my assumption too, but reading in German-speaking forums/newspapers has changed that quite a while ago
Growing up it honestly never occurred to me that to *some* my dual citizenship would appear as controversial if I were in another country
Wasn't able to follow it's development as i was too young, but i do know that here gay people still can't donate blood
Went to do so with a friend some months ago and got denied
He was told to say to us that it was because of high glucose or some shit, but the official reason was that they do not accept donations by people that had homosexual intercourses in the prior few months
the question on the paper was something like "did you have any unprotected sexual intercoures in the last x months
" and it was exactly the same one for homosexual intercourses
I answered yes to the first and no to the second, my pal did the opposite
I could donate, he couldn't
The nurses themselves were sorry about it and agreed on the stupidity of this norm, but that was it
I find the Italian language the most beautiful to hear
Mine is French
It can be very seductive
I really enjoy hearing russian
For me it feels gentle and warm
And in women sexy
I honestly don't mind/care
But I've noticed that during the morning hours, ragging on the U.S seems to be an easy karma grab on must subs
(specially on r/soccer)
I hate the muricans calling the French cowards
They're not
In Switzerland the jokes are mostly about the fact that they don't have the bidet
I didn't really have one, but my mother would call me "müsli" or "bärli" sometimes
basically "little mouse" or "little bear".
My mother called me and my brother « les petits loups », the little wolves
And later when we were older it changed to « les grands loup », the big wolves
Im biracial, father is Peruvian, mother is Swiss and we mostly speak Spanish at home
Mom never uses anything specific to refer to us as children, mostly just the names
My father on the other hand refers to us girls as the princesitas (little princesses) and when including my baby bro it's mis amorcitos (my little loves)
He's a very over the top affectionate type tho, parents of friends often refer to them as the children (los niños/d Chend)
Eh Digga räum mal dein Zimmer auf amenakoi
Muesli is the grain based cereal
Müsli means small mouse
I'm sure to almost everyone on earth they look similar and would sound very similar, but there is a difference
Words are written phonetically in Swiss German, so even the spelling isn't standard, but people know if you mean mouse or cereal
I'd pronounce Muesli like Müesli and the other as Müsli
A lot of the vagueness of Swiss German comes from the length of vowel sounds and how one would write them down
It is not unusual in my dialect to see words with two or even three U or O next to one another, and sometimes one with an umlaut
We also have the h making vowels long, like in standard German, and the UE combo as well
I would say that in this case the UE combo sounds slightly different in tone from the ü, with a bit of a tighter lipped nasal U sound
The ü sounds like a more conventional long u sound, although relative to standard German, I would say it sounds more in length like three Us in a row
Muuusli is the sound for small mouse, and the cereal is more like Muhusli, with the U shorter than one might expect and make that h very soft and short so it is just  kind of a tonal change to the U. Of course, drive to the next city and it is a little different
lol
It's pronounced müesli
One can see that spelling used here as well sometimes, but müesli or muesli are more common
First of all, i don't think duolingo is good at _teaching_. It's good at giving you a basic vocabulary which will be enough to survive as a tourist in a foreign country
This said, for italian it is just very reductive
I had a friend from inner Switzerland using duolingo to learn italian and i would sometimes practice some conversations with him, we quickly realized that duolingo lets you memorize some sentences and that's it
I remember being told in school that I'd be able to communicate in basic german after getting the b1, then we went on a school trip in Stuttgart and i was at restaurants like "ich brauche etwas zu essen"
Doesn't quite fit your question but in swiss penal law, by definition, men can't be victim to rape
Art
190 StGB
Any person who forces a person of the **female sex** by threats or violence, psychological pressure or by being made incapable of re- sistance to submit to sexual intercourse is liable to a custodial sentence of from one to ten years
"Raping" a man is still punishable, but under a different Article
What's so bad about betting
It's already limited to adults only
And it makes watching sports games more "thrilling" in my opinion
Of course if you lose you can't blame anyone else than yourself
What about weed
Oh it's reddit
I think this stuff smells so bad and should be illegal in public
Or when boarding a train and they take One More Drag before chucking the butt to the tracks and get on the train, exhaling their stench all through the carriage =/
Pilatus Dragon, a dragon that lives on mount Pilatus in Lucerne
Also there‘s a myth that Pontius Pilatus, the guy who some would call responsible for the crucification of Jesus, is burried in a lake on that mountain
Oh wow, do you think the house-elves in Harry Potter are based on your kaukai
I had no idea Tomte Tummetott has a mythological background
I loved that story as a kid
Ooh
Have you ever heard of Astrid Lindgren‘s „Tomte Tummetott“? It sounds like he could be a nisser
It used to be one of my favourite books as a kid
Germany, Switzerland and Austria are producing and playing the crime series « Tatort » together, usually playing on sunday night on ARD, SRF, ORF
I’m from Switzerland
The stereotype I hate is foreigners thinking we’re all rich
One I find amusing, .. I need to think
I thought German sounded harsh and was hard to learn
(Studied for +10 years at school), well that was until I heard Swiss German
I find the rich thing hella amusing
Even if I’m broke as fuck, I like to pretend and act like I’m super rich with my foreign friends
Probably because that’s the closest I’ll ever be to actually being super rich
I never heard the one about French woman are hairy (I heard this for Portuguese women though)
I’ve heard the one that you guys are always going on strike though, but this one must come from jealousy as strike is forbidden here
I should try it then ! Oh, most of my foreign friends also assumed at one point that I am/was/might have been working as a banker
That’s true but then everything like rents, insurances, taxes etc is twice as expensive
Ahah that’s true !
Exactly
I used to find this stereotype, like we’re all rich, funny but after a few times it gets boring ahah
Our central bank ceased to maintain a somewhat constant rate between the frank and the euro
Is he viewed positively in Slovenia
My grandparents were too young to participate in ww2, but my German grandfather escaped from now Poland via train with his mother when he was six
He still says Poland belongs to Germany
My grandmother wasn't alive at the time of ww2
My Italian grandfather was also too young, but he told stories of collecting every scrap of metal to sell and another story where Americans came into Italy and he saw the first black guy ever
Different times
He still has an unexploded grenade and he had a gun until the police took it from him
I got to shoot the gun once
One of my great grandfathers changed the family name because he wanted to go to the military and our name at the time wasn't "German enough" lmao so we weren't allowed in the military
Anyway, two great grandfathers died in the second World War and one survived with wounds
Idk what happened to the other
I never met any of them
Edit: might be confusing but I'm German and Italian but was born and raised in Switzerland and have the Swiss passport, so I consider myself Swiss
Probably 0
Would've made a good joke though
I'd like to have such a "slice of life" life where my adventurous uncle takes me around the world chasing after hidden treasures
:-)
Sure, Donald being Donald, he'd rather be chilling in his hammock instead of being paid pennies for being dragged around the world but the nephews enjoy that life thoroughly
Here in Switzerland we call a dryer "Tumbler".
"Handy" for a mobile phone
"Oldtimer" for a classic/antique car
"Beamer" for a digital projector
"Hometrainer" is an exercise device you have at home (e.g. exercise bike)
"Smoking" is a tuxedo
"Public viewing" is a public screening, usually sport events
Like when restaurants or bars show an important match on a big screen for everybody to watch
And we call it a Drive-In instead of Drive-thru
I'm guessing this is because many would have problems pronouning the "th" in thru
Same here in Switzerland
Also, don't order food on the menu that has no price to it
Even if everything else is cheap
They will make you pay 10x the amount if you order it
(as a parent) No school on Wednesdays
So reading this thread it seems that students need to get voting rights asap
Not that i am generally in favor of lower voting age, but these answers show that politics is completely irresponsive to the needs of the people who actually go to school
People get put in boxes super early
As soon as kids are 12-13, (when they reach middle school) they get put in either 3 “regroupements”
1; 2; and 3
Regroupement 3 (also called R3) is only composed of the good students
The ones that have a chance at highschool and then college
R2 is the middle ground
They have a possibility of going to college, but only after an extra year and most fail that year
They either go to a “general culture school” after middle school which will help them go into different jobs, such as nursing for exemple, or they start an apprenticeship at the age of 15-16, to become a butcher, for example
Then there’s R1
These are the troublemakers, the bottom class, the “idiots”. They basically are forced to do an apprenticeship, but will be chosen last if people from R2 or R3 are available
Again, this is switzerland
Apprenticeships aren’t as negatively seen as in France, for exemple
The Matura (paper to go to uni) is only held by 20% of the whole population
People can make a really good living with apprenticeships by joining the workforce later on
I just find it sad that people get put in boxes so early, because it discourages the kids, and of course, friends influence, so if you have a class full of troublemakers, there’s practically no chance you’ll change, even if you have huge potential and just started out on the wrong foot
Btw: kids have the possibility to change regroupments every year, either going up or down
I think thats somewhat exclusive to France in Europe
The US seems to have a similar situation though
Isnt Macron trying to change this and making other educational paths more standard
Wednesdays *afternoon*
I'd put the lack of quality control on a higher priority
Joining the Matura showed me just how different school was in not even just cantons, but fucking regions if not towns
Reddit also carried the same message
I feel like it improved the efficiency of education drastically
But ideally it is done subject-specific and with the possibility to change later still
Centuries old tradition of Wednesday being the day children are supposed to help out at home/farm
Except that has absolutely no relevance today
Nope
The whole day in every single primary school as far I know
Great in what sense
I had school on wednesday mornings 7 years ago
*fuck*, that was 7 years ago
What canton
For us it was just wednesday afternoon (Solothurn, for reference)
Geneve
And I'm 100% sure I could do my job in 2/3 of the weekly hours
Doesn't mean my employer would be thrilled by my "efficiency".
Having the whole Wednesday off has changed as of approximately 6-7 years, at least in Geneva
Not primary school
Read the post people
Yes primary school
What are you talking about
What side of geneva are you in
At least in Carouge it’s changed 6 years ago
There is no school at all on Wednesdays until 5P in Geneva
I can't speak on Carouge
Okay
Then you’re probably right
Thanks for letting me know
Let's go around the horn
**Italy** - *Vitello Tonnato*. Looks a bit bland and iffy, but trust me it's refreshingly delicious and oddly comforting
One of my favorite summer dishes
**France** - *Tripes à la lyonnaise*. I was a bit worried when the waitress second guessed my order
But I'm glad I stuck to it
Gelatinous, fatty, enriching, filling
Do NOT pair it with foie gras like I did one time though, thought I was gonna choke from the richness
**Portugal** - *Caldo Verde*. The decription made it seem like a simple Soup de Jour the restaurant put together because they didn't have anything else to serve
Ate it every single chance I got
Loved it
Cheap
Warming
Delicious
Only issue
ONE piece of chourico in each bowl
But apparently that's the tradition
**Spain** - *Pan con Tomate
* Thought it was a bit odd that my Spanish friend said this was her favorite thing to eat for breakfast
Yeah, I get it now
Spanish (and Greek) tomatoes are on another level for some reason
**England** - *Scotch Eggs*. Who wants to eat a deep fried boiled egg while drinking
The British
But it was so damn good, and now I make sure to get one if I'm at a pub that serves them
**Greece** - *Greek Yogurt*. It's not even a yogurt to me, it's something else
I'm not even one to particularly enjoy dairy, but I could eat a barrel of real Greek Yogurt
Greek food in general is so underrated
Greek yogurt/feta cheese abroad tastes nothing like the real thing
Likewise I don't know how they make a simple Tomato/Onion salad taste so incredible
The flag of the helvetic republic, when we were one of napoléons puppet states
the flag of the Helvetic Republic (napoleon's puppet government of Switzerland) is just generally very ugly
Question to your flair
what the hell is an afro-German
Just never heard it
The afro-xxx is rather an American thing I'd say
I honestly never heard of that term
I mostly either just see them as German or from whereever they come from
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
Here we go
(and I'm just starting to realize a lot of them are very erotic)
Chalk that up to teenagers being sexually frustrated
"Verde/Blanco" - Basically your squad (must all dress it one color) v. another squad (in another color)
Lined up facing each other
About 60 liters of beers between both teams
First one to finish their case wins
If you puke you're out and the rest of your team has to compensate
(In the U.S we play Anchorman and the idea is similar - but with far less puking)
"Jaj shot". You basically sit a length away and lob something (sandball at the beach for ex) in the air aiming to hit each other's groin
You move closer with every miss
"Chicken" - Two guys/girls basically start the process of kissing/or touching each other
First one to "chicken out" loses
"Truth or Dare"/"Spin the Bottle" - With the most common "dare" being "seven minutes in heaven" which was basically an excuse to makeout with someone for seven minutes (or more realistically - awkwardly stand there in the dark doing small talk)
"Maltupakki" - Korean game that's way too complicated to explain
So I'll just leave this video
Damn that reminds me of a game wa used to play where all the kids tried to get on top of a boulder and tried to knock everybody else off there
And for us it wasn't the car type or color, but the license plate
If you saw a number at least 3 consecutive times (e.g. 555) on a license plate you could punch your sibling (or friend, but mostly a sibling) in the arm
We use the word Chuchichäschtli for this purpose
The CH sound in Swiss German is a back of the throat sound akin to choking, so this word captures all the beauty of the language
I have mutliple cases:
&#x200B;
When in Germany:
I use this sentence mostly when a german asks me why I don't have a heavy swiss accent when talking standart german
I say: "Ig würd ja bärndütsch redä, aber de würdisch mi nüm verstah"
German: "Ich würde ja Berndeutsch reden, aber dann würdest du mich nicht mehr verstehen
English: "I would talk in Bernese German if I could, but then you wouldn't understand me anymore"
No one has ever understood a single word
Oh and of course: Chuchichäschtli or Chäschüächli (Kitchendrawer and Cheesecake)
&#x200B;
When someone thinks he would understand me:
And when I really wan't to annoy someone I say: "Gö mir hinech bluttere uf d Chrömi ga choddere
This sentence doesn't really have a meaning, I just tried to put as many bearly known and older Bernese german words into the sentence
Wich means "Do you want to go spitting on cookies this evening without wearing shoes
German: "Gehen wir heute Abend barfuss auf Kekse spucken
This sentence is a really old Bernese German and the only person I know who would understand this sentence is my grandma
This is how this sentence would be spoke out today (by a teen or younger person, some older people still use the word "hinech" (this evening/ later this day: "Gö mir hüt am abä Bluttfues uf d Güetzi ga spöiä?"
&#x200B;
When I meet someone from Switzerland who isn't from Bern
I just try to use the word "äuä" as much as I can
Chuchichästli, best word ever
I noticed that it is written on Migros bakery bags
There seems to be an unreasonable amount of work in a video that really doesn't even need to exist
Even in ticino it is
Ah shit, here we go again
Any of them except Zürich, Bern, Basel, Geneva or Lausanne (and maybe some tourist towns like Zermatt)
Empire Austro-Hongrois
Autriche-Hongrie
Öschtrich-Ungarn

Plot twist, he had a typo
Funnily in swiss german its said as: "gärn"
It is impossible to make friends after you finish school
So, Reddit basically
I don't understand either, I'm not old enough yet
I've heard that a lot of people here find it difficult to make friends after they finish school e. g. if they move to a different city
This is one of the reasons why a lot of people have ridiculous commutes here: they don't want to leave because they wouldn't know anyone at the new place
Forgeiners also say they find it difficult to make friends
If you're doing some sort of sport or are in some other sort of association, you might make friends there though
The stereotype is of course exaggerating but still true to some extent
In residential homes it's basically unheard of in Switzerland
If anything, you might occasionally see a ceiling fan (or a portable one like I use)
In some public places they've started to crop up recently
In larger shops or malls you might have central AC
In office spaces it depends I'd say
In public transport there's AC, but they don't cool the air down to an absolute temperature, instead they'll just cool it by 5-7 °C relative to the outside temperature
And they've gotten quite a bit of flack for that during the recent heatwaves
Also in hospitals or retirement homes it's by no means guaranteed to have AC
We change our constitution all of the time
It can be changed through a popular initiative or a proposal of parliament
It always has to be approved by the people in a vote
~~The last~~ A recent one which got approved was the mass-imigration-initiative in 2014, but we vote on some all the time
The last revision of the whole constitution was in 1999, which simplified it and cleaned it up
Edit: I missed at least one constitution change in 2018, which was the counter proposal of the Federal Council for the Bycicle Initiative
Well our first constitution was coined in 1848, before that Switzerland was pretty much just an alliance between the cantons
after that, we made some small changes in 1866, to give more equality to Jewish people, then there are the "first -" and "last total revisions" in 1874 and 1999, which changed a bunch of stuff
Well that's a fun thing here in Switzerland
We're quite famous for our right to "make our own laws" by voting
Well part of this is called the initiative, basically someone proposes a new addition/change, get enough people to sign it (just like a petition) and then the wole country just votes on that
A bit simplified but you get the gist
We do not have the power to make direct laws
We can only make changes to the constitution
So of course some stuff like equal rights or whatever absolutely has its place there
But just a few years ago we voted wether or not to additionally support farmers that don't cut off the cow's horns and thus keep it more natural
That was an initiative
It got denied by voting but if it weren't it would have gone straight to the constitution that here cows should have horns
(There's much more to voting here in switzerland and it's way more complex but just ask if you have questions)
>The last approved was the mass-imigration-initiative
Are you sure your copy of the Constitution is up to date ? Because there have been many amendments since 2014, such as art
88 about pedestrian and cycle paths which we voted on in 2018
I used [this] as source, but it is possible that there are other constitution changes we voted on which were proposed by the parliament
I missed the initiative about the bycicles because it was a direct counterproposal by the Federal Council, so it wasn't listed in my source
You're right
In german speaking switzerland wie pronounce it Eichhörnli, but the explanation is the same as with the german (from germany) one
Eichhörnli
Non-native speakers usually don't learn our dialect
It obviously shares the etymology of the standard German word
Ha, this is no match for the Swiss *Chuchichästli*
They claim to be neutral and treat it like the national religion and then go and sell weaponry to countries like Saudi-Arabia
Good job
Oh and some politicians are really scared of the EU taking over and wants as little treaties as possible which makes no sense
Our entire position against the EU ... I'm living directly beides the German border and would love to enjoy the freedom of travel as the Europeans
We can travel equally as easy but I feel the European spirit here in Switzerland but we're just not ready enough to join in :/
Selling weapons
same
Ah yes, selling weaponry to Arabic countries and then complaining about the refugies that are fleeing from the weapons you sold to this region
Not recognising Armenian genocide
Does Turkey run your country
> would love to enjoy the freedom of travel as the Europeans
how is your freedom of travel limited
We are supposed to be neutral since 1815 (treaty of Vienna)
Our country as we know it didn't even exist back then but it still applies because Switzerland signed it, just a different Switzerland
Just like a treaty that we made with Königreich Württemberg
I'm in university and it's way more trouble to make a semester in a European country than for Europeans ... I also like the European spirit of unity besides the many different languages and cultures
So you don't recognise it but you also don't deny it
You just don't talk about it or what
I agree with you on that one
Letting trains with whatever it might be just cross our country north to south or south to north and selling weaponry to everyone
However, you don't even have to go as far as WW2 for too much involvement
But South Sudan is a normal UN member state which is recognised by basically everyone so it's not that special
I know, i know that I didn't describe my point very good  and didn't know how to better describe it
But didn't want to delete the comment because there were alot of replys already :/
Migros v. Coop

In Switzerland, I'd say the biggest battlefield (by far) are dialects
Is the linguistic variety from Zurich better than the one from Basel or is it the other way around
Is the dialect from Bern the prettiest or is it maybe the one from Thurgau
Also, by extension, Swiss people get very fired up about the use of anglicisms and especially germanisms in our "helvetic" language
For example there's a big fight going on about the issue of whether it is acceptable to use the plural "Männer" (men) for Maa (man) or whether that is a yucky evil German influence and we should all make a point of saying the proper "Mannä". This may seem like a triviality to you but remember, this is a country where almost everything else already works
so you might as well fight over language
Other big arguments exist over words such as "einkaufen" (shopping) instead of Swiss "poschtä", "seltsam/merkwürdig" (strange) instead of Swiss "struub", or "deshalb" (therefore) instead of Swiss "drum". Sometimes it's even just a small phonological transition that can make people lose their temper
For example some people now say "weil", "kaum" and "peinlich" instead of "proper" Swiss "wil", "chuum" and "piinlich", which others get enraged by
So yeah
this is the hill we all die on
Team both
Coop chind for life
Man, I hate that stuff
It's always "THURGAU/BASEL/(other canton you don't like) BAD XD" mixed with r/badlinguistics and unnecessary circlejerking about how only one's own dialect is the correct one (even though there's obviously no standard version of Swiss German)
Edit: Also, trying to celebrate Swiss German's linguistic diversity while still getting enraged about any (perceived) expression vom Germany you use
NO, FUCK YOU, SAYING "BUTTER" INSTEAD OF "ANKE" DOESN'T MEAN OUR LANGUAGE IS DYING (especially because that word has been part of many dialects for generations)
See, in Switzerland the debate would be about whether you should even spank yourself in a place where you're naked with other people, with any devices, birch or otherwise
[W. Nuss vo Bümplitz by Patent Ochsner is amazing for karaoke]
From Zürich I've taken direct trains to Hamburg, Paris, Vienna, Budapest (some of them night trains)
I've also used the train to get to Debrecen (via Budapest) and Brest (via Paris)
In my experience trains outside of Switzerland are unreliable af - especially Germany is terrible, France less so but still not good
I therefore only use international train connections when I don't have to keep to a fixed schedule, for the same reason I also try to not change train more than once outside of Switzerland (switching trains is just too much of a hassle if the schedule is unreliable)
In summary: If I'm on a fixed schedule I fly, not because I'm in a hurry but because the trains outside of Switzerland are unreliable
If I've got no fixed schedule I take the train because it doesn't matter
Mostly the overall duration of the trip
Will i be away for two weeks
Train it is
A weekend in Amsterdam
Plane
That is, unless the distance is prohibitive by train
I once had the complete opposite happening to me
I went to Tuscany and everything went perfect just until I entered Switzerland again
We waited in Chiasso for the customs service a really long time (they always wait but not this long) and thus were 10 minutes late
Later, we couldn't go through the Gotthard and had to go over it
An additional hour
We arrived at our destination about 80 minutes late
The only downside to that is it will be expensive af
Well our trains are pretty nice, especially compared to other countries, but we still tend to give it too much shit
No matter how good it gets, it's never good enough as you get used to the current standard
So it's good, it's expensive but we still mind too much
In the very rare cases where Switzerland appears in an international movie, it's usually mentioned in the context of a "secret bank account". This is a misrepresentation on two counts
Firstly, the banking secret actually doesn't exist anymore (certainly not for foreign citizens)
The times where dictators could hide their dark money in Swiss banks are gone
And secondly, I would argue that the banks are a rather bad representation of our country
They are predominantly located in one specific city and the vast majority of Swiss people neither works for a bank nor has made their money with the help of these banks
There isn't that many secret organisation headquarters in the Alpe
Yeas and no
Banks make up to 6% of our GDP
> The times where dictators could hide their dark money in Swiss banks are gone
Hmm
I would say it just got more difficult
I think there are always ways to invest in some shady company or something like this
No, that's the entire financial sector, which includes insurance business
The banking sector is just a fraction of that - the wealth management domain is even smaller
Something like this just a few weeks ago, if I recall correctly
But the guests were just trapped for a few hours before helicopters evacuated them
Everyone knows Portugal doesn't actually exist
- The 30 years war is the closest to what an actual period of total war looks like, could make for great RPG or strategy games
I wonder why there aren’t any yet
- the time around 1480 to 1520 between Charles-V of Spain and Francois 1er of France
Includes intrigues at court and war, great discoveries, a new world to conquer
- Of course the roman period, I would suggest the time of Caesar and Augustus, but the punic war is cool too
- the 100 year war
- the viking invasions between 782 and 1000
- the barbarian and mongol invasions
- the siege of Vienna
- the fall of constantinople
(Has mostly been done in Total war games)
Yeah I agree
Some TW games lack unit diversity because the region is too homogene, like in Shogun or Three kingdoms
In Switzerland we call the Germans "Schwobe" which originally referred to people from a specific region in Germany
And we call Italians "Tschingge" which is a bit more offensive and comes from the Italian word for five
Italians are 'Tschingge' (from 'cinque') and Germans are, depending on the dialect, 'Schwabe' or 'Schwobe'. This is because that's Swabians are the first Germans you will meet when going to Germany from Switzerland
We just named everyone in Germany after the Germans closest to us, which is something a lot of languages do
Otherwise, we're too busy calling each other names so we don't have time to give more names to our neighbours
Wait, how do you call cockroaches then
The rise of the NSDAP is coupled with the interwar chapters
The WW2 part actually covers the most important frontlines, though no battles in detail
We actually looked at the Swiss status during the war in entirely separate books/lessons
The holocaust is addressed in a separate part that follows WW2
German expulsions are also mentioned there but briefly
From my experience, chicken is obviously the most found poultry, but second place in nicer restaurant duck is second place
In cheaper places and in supermarkets, turkey is second place because it's quite cheap
You will then find 'Trutenschnitzel' sometimes as the schnitzel variety made from poultry
'Trutenschinken' (ham made from turkey) is also quite common
[Olten, the most beautiful hole in Switzerland
I couldnt find a single reply for Switzerland
The obvious answers would probably be Dietikon or Spreitenbach but i dont know if you can really count them since they only exist as part of a bigger agglomeration
If we only count single cities it gets really difficult
Maybe Winterthur or Chur
I dont wouldn't say it's ugly, but a lot of people have an intense dislike for Olten
The Kanti is really ugly tho, I still get war flashbacks from it
Was thinking Winterthur as well
In switzerland yes, but not in person, just online
Memepages have mocked my dialect a lot in the past
Jokes on you, at least we can speak high german without or just with a slight accent
Many swiss people from other cantons have pretty distinct and sometimes kinda harsh accents
A german linguistics prof at my uni once ‚judged‘ our accents in german and he said the same
In the US people seem to think our accent is cute
I was often asked where I‘m from, because I have ‚such a cute accent‘.
Nah I'm from around Basel, we have the most normal swiss german
Though I've met  drunk Graubündner guys who thought it was very funny to hear us say "Basler Leckerli"
Thats the first thing we do when we meet someone with another accent
We mock each others accent
So yes
"we have the most normal swiss german"
i‘m pretty sure that‘s what everyone says
the beautiful thing about swiss german is that every dialect has an aspect of it that you can make fun of
"we have the most normal swiss german" god I laughed so hard  pretty sure everybody thinks that about their dialect
Yes, but with us it's true :p jk I just say that because it's one of the more universally understandable dialects (compared to wallis for example)
Idk my friend, it's one of the dialects I've heard being joked about the most after Thurgauer and Walliser
The question isn't really about how understandable your dialect/accent is, but if people think it's funny
And Swiss people basically think every dialect but their own is either hilarious or just horrible
that‘s true
i‘d say the closer to germany, the more understandsble
We had 4 girls from Basel in out J+S course last year (i‘m from lucerene) and the rest of us was from lucerne and we laughed alot about the accents
But we kept it at a reasonable level, so that it wouldn‘t sound mean
When i talked about our „Corps“ one girl was happy that i also sang in my freetime because she understood „chor“
I‘m learning french (which also has the subjonctif)
I struggle so much, because I can never remember how to form it and when to use it
For exapmle you use the subjonctif after „Je ne pense pas que ...“ (I don‘t think ...)
Je ne pense pas qu‘il te comprenne
= I don‘t think he understands you
but you don‘t use it after „Je pense que“ (I think ...)
Je pense qu‘il te comprend
= I think he understands you
French speaking people: Correct me if I‘m wrong btw
Most companies
Yes
International Orgs (like the U.N)
Haha F off
AFAIK internships can only be unpaid if they have a "genuine educational aspect", meaning they include classes, coaching, exams etc
or are mandated and supervised by a school
The people in charge of such interns must also have some form of teaching or training licence (they must have the proper qualifications to train new people for whatever industry the internship is in)
IIRC there were even court cases where companies failed to provide "genuine educational aspects" had to retroactively pay their interns
So any internship that's purely for work experience (eg
The classical go get coffee internship) must be paid
It’s funny because I expected New York to be entirely made out of modern glass skyscrapers but instead most of them are tall stone facade buildings like the empire state building
Not a movie but the (very problematic but oh well) netflix show/book adaptation of  „Thirteen Reasons Why“ was translated to „Tote Mädchen lügen nicht“ which means „dead girls don‘t lie“
they changed the title "zootopia" into "zoomania" in the german version
why
it's still english, so why even change anything
Edit: the change also removes the word play
We call it „Vergiss mein nicht“ which is „Forget me not“ which is a little blue flower so it at least has some very basic play on words but the beauty of that title is still lost
Oh god that is even worse
Well, yea
The entire thing is pretty disturbing imo
I actually really like it, but mainly because I also really like that poem
No, luckily not
Definitly "W Nuss vo Bümpliz" from Patent Ochsner
That song is a goddamn bop and noone can tell me otherwise
There's nothing to feel guilty about with this one, truly a masterpiece
Also, the Scots in a Karaoke bar on Lanzarote seemed to like it as well
How is this one a guilty pleasure
Because it is to me
Nobody i know would listen to it

AskSwitzerland is the best and only Swiss YouTuber I know
Le Grand JD
The only Swiss youtuber I watch is easyvote
lionel battegay/Ask Switzerland
He's making street interviews in swiss german, he's awesome :)
In the french part of Switzerland we have "Le Grand JD". He has been, among other things, to Irak to show how the war really was out there
In addition to him and more surprisingly there is our national television who posts short films and fictions which are pretty great IMO
Melonpan lol
TIL Kurzgesagt is based in Munich, for some reason thought they only took Kurzgesagt for a catchy tone
I don't think there are many swiss YouTubers tbh
I really like Le Grand JD, he’s pretty popular among french speakers I think
They *began* with the English channel
The German one came later, just FYI if you didn't know
There are a few but not many
For most YouTube is just something they do extra
omg I know this dude lmao the swissmeme page use to post him a lot haha didn't know he had a youtube channel
"Ja liebe Honigkuchenpferde" haha
How can you tell
I just scrolled through his channel, everything's in English
Just curious
Very common, I always shake hands with men I don't know yet
Not quite with close friends tho, we just dap up
It is very common, though there are variations between formal handshakes, informal handshakes and even handshakes with hugs
With friends and acquaintances, we do informal handshakes or the handshake into a hug
With women it's a formal handshake or three kisses, or a close hug when you are really close
**Personal:** Cats
although, I'm not much into pets
**National:** It's probably around 50:50
There are lots of people who like dogs but there are also lots of people who prefer cats
**Continent:** I think this depends on the region
In Southern Europe and the Balkans it's probably dogs, the more north you go probably a preference for cats
Eastern Europe
I don't know very much about this region but my guess would be dogs
I'm deliberately writing this before looking at any of the other answers ;-)
I'm a cat person, despite being allergic to them but not to dogs
I can't really say for my country or continent, but I know that cats are actually quite a pest and a danger to the small bird populations around here, sadly
I still can't help but love them
There's a religion in northern India called Jainism
I believe it's a sub-religion of Buddhism
One of their main tenets is non-violence and Jain monks go as far as sweeping the ground in front of them when they go for a walk to avoid stepping on any bugs
You just reminded me of them ;-)
Rumansh, which is considered a romance language and spoken in parts of Graubünden
Also I think eventhough people know about swiss german, I doubt anyone actually knows about the specific dialects we speak, like how different Bärndütsch and Baslerditsch sound
There is a language called Rätoromanisch in Switzerland but only very few people speak it
Rumantsch always sounded super weird to me
It's like a mish-mash of 6 different romanic languages all morphed into each other
Hahaha absolutely
But I love listening to weird languages so I enjoy this little one
As a french speaker believe me most of us can’t tell the difference either
Can you actually immediately tell if someone is French or Swiss by the a cent
Like for the love of God I couldn't tell them appart unless they say some very specific words I know only Swiss say :'D
Some people have a very strong accent so it’s pretty obvious to me, I can also often tell from which region of the Romandie they’re from
But today the accents are getting a bit lost, mostly in the cities where you’ll find most Swiss speak in a more generic french accent
So I often can’t tell right away, until they talk more and I pay attention to it

No, not reliant on having car, but it makes life a lot easier
I'm reliant of a car because I hate being dependent to public transportation
Have to look up for hours and coincidences and have to deal with delays makes me mad
I love the freedom a car gives you
I use public transportation all the time
It takes me 40 minutes to get to school but I have a zvv card for all of Zurich so I can go where I like
Not at all
I'm 18 years old and since I live in Zurich, I'm not planning to get a driver's license in the near future
Driving in Zurich really isn't nice, cycling is better but also not great so public transport it is, which is pretty great, especially for a city this size
And for trips outside of the city I can use public transport as well, there are trains every 30 minutes between major cities, suburban trains run every 30 minutes as well in Zurich, in other cities either every 30 or 60 minutes
There even are hourly trains on many rural lines and if there's no trains there's probably a bus that depending on how rural it is either runs hourly or just a few times a day
For the locals, these aren't really an alternative to the car because some only run a few times a day and those which do run hourly often stop quite early in the evening
Well you guys have our old trams now
Meanwhile, we've opened a few new lines and now don't have enough trams because the old ones are in Ukraine and the new ones aren't here yet
We finally got a car after living here for almost 7 years without one
We use it so infrequently that we sometimes have to remember just where we parked it (street parking only)
I'm still not sure if it was a worthwhile purchase, but its been done, so
Meanwhile, I have a 10 minute bicycle commute to work, and the bus/tram stops are within two blocks of the apartment
Why would you even try to drive there
You’re not allowed to mow your lawn on Sunday
But knowing our love for peace and quiet, I can easily imagine someone calling the police on you if you do
iirc they don't give an extra charge in the US if you escape before you were sentenced to prison or arrived in prison because of the natural need of a normal person for freedom, or something
*Time for a holy crusade I'd say*
Similar situation in Switzerland
Regarding grey area downloading and streaming, it is important to note that there are many shows which you cannot watch legally either, no matter how much you are willing to pay
Amazon Prime doesn't have a lot of the content here, and neither does Netflix
So Bulgaria is Japan in hardcore mode
They "just" have to censor their porn, iirc
We *really* love our peace and quiet
Neighbors have a loud car because of a special exhaust pipe (I don't remember what type), got the police called on them, couldn't do anything (sadly) because the exhaust pipe gets measured a certain way and in that way it's on normal decibel levels
iirc downloading is fully legal, contributing it is illegal
Might have it wrong in my head though
I'd say Belgrad because it was (maybe even still is idk) the capitol of the country that once dominated the Balkans (Yugoslavia) or maybe even still does (Serbia)
A few years back there was some construction work in the middle of the city in front of the opera house in Zürich
During those construction work they found remains of a pile dweller settlement, dated from around 3000 BC
These findings included the second oldest [door] of the world (the oldest one being found in another place in Zürich), kids clothing, pots etc
In another place in Zürich, many years back, also during construction works an old Roman bath was found
In the city: ticket machine, pay with coins or card, ticket machines at train stations also accept bank notes
In some areas they also have ticket machines in the vehicles
Trains: ticket machine or ticket office if there is one
Suburban and rural bus route: if there is no ticket machine at the stop or in the bus, you can buy a ticket from the driver
You can also use apps to buy your tickets
You can either buy normal tickets or use this service that tracks you on your route and then charges you at the end of the day
Since a few days I got the option to travel with activated gps
The app is linked to my credit card and the cost for the travel is being charged automatically
I personally don't use it for privacy reasons, I prefer to buy the ticket via app manually before boarding the train/bus
Many ways: cash or cards at the vending machine, using the app to buy a ticket, or use the checkin-checkout feature of the app with the appropriate ticket bought automatically by the app
But most people using public transport regularly have some sort of yearly ticket allowing them to use it whenever they want and as much as they want
I just buy a public transport card which I can use for a year instead of buying a ticket every day
costs about 1
2k for one year
Price depends on how many zones you want to travel
We don't pay by time but by distance/zones

I said I'm from Switzerland and they said: "Ahhh
Schoki, Schoki" (short word for Chocolate in the way Germans think Swiss-Germans say it)
I cringed really hard
How hot does it get
I always thought about moving to Norway to escape our hot summers (30C but very dry)
It is quite shocking how many people don't realize that those are not the same countries
I personally don't have that problem but once was fooled by the accident and thought it was a Scottish or even British accent, leading to the question "where from the UK are your from
" - I've learned from that mistake and will phrase the question differently, but I'm still having a hard time picking up the different accents in English language
With that said, if I say I'm American or <Latin American country>, I get a lot of "but where are you really from
" here in Europe, hence my opening statement in the comment above
So let's add that to the list as well
Same thing
I am German and never learned to speak the Swiss dialect
But tbh while I see how it can get annoying for some people, I have encountered this so often and not a single time was it meant in a negative way
They were just curious
So I'm not really bothered and just tell them where I'm born / where my parents are from, but how it doesn't really matter because I grew up in Zurich
Then they also usually realize that I don't have a lot more knowledge about Germany than they do
These news are already a few months old but whatever
In the cantonal parliament of Zurich (Kantonsrat), there are now (since the elections happened on the 24th of March) more members of our country's two green parties and there is one of the seven members of our Regierungsrat (cantonal government) is someone from the Green Party as well

The Gotthard base tunnel is the longest railway tunnel in the world with 57 km
The one you drive isn't the record breaking one though, it's only approx 15km I believe
Quite scary experience still
You might be right with the 17, haven't looked it up ;)
The no end in sight is indeed a strange feeling, especially if it persists so long
But what really messes with me is the fact that it's the highway but it's a single lane and no center divider (which never exists outside of tunnels here
This just makes it more claustrophobic for me somehow and seems way more dangerous
I seldom eat potatoes so besides gnocchi once a year I probably won’t miss it
I'd eat bread, rice, quinoa and pasta in place of potatoes, probably
But I'd be sad, so many delicious dishes wouldn't exist without potatoes
Rösti and Raclette won't work without potates
The authorities have been informed, your licence to bünzli will be revoked
Ticinese here, haha, not every one in Switzerland is German or French/s

No, actually most people are Swiss
This is a typical Swiss joke, no humor in it :)
[Relevant]
I may cite you for stirring up feelings
Some ice hockey clubs have a similar fan "culture" (afaik not all)
But football is definitely more in the news about this issue
Same in Switzerland
Afaik it's more like a fair
But I've never been to a schwingen tournament and probably never will
You didn't butchered it
The 100% correct word would be the "Eidgenössische Schwingfest" or just the "Eidgenössische". The "king" comes from the title
The winner of the Eidgenössische becomes the "Schwingkönig" (King of the Schwinger)
I grew up on the countryside
I definitely know what you mean with rowdier
Fun fact: In my Rugby Club we once had a guy who was a Schwinger when he was a child
God I hated to go in contact against him
Even thought he didn't used the technique (at least afaik) he always brought me down without any problems (And I was 20kg+ heavier than him)
Never tried to Schwing
But I don't like the over the top Swissness of Schwingfests anyway
The Winner of the Eidgenössische gets bull
Or a money equivalent if he don't like the bull
In smaller Schwingfest they get maybe bells
We would be desperately trying to get along with everyone by staying neutral about everything
For example if Russia was stabbing Ukraine under the table we'd just say "please be nice to each other my friends", even if Russia was doing most of the aggression
After all, we want to be friends with everyone, including Russia
At the same time, however, we would awkwardly keep to ourselves whenever someone suggested some group activity
For example: Germany: "Does anyone want to play a fun drinking game
" Everyone: "Yeeeaaah
" Switzerland: "Ehh, sounds weird, we'll just watch you from the corner over there
We'd also try to make up rules for everything to make this evening more structured and orderly
For example: "Nobody is allowed to drink alcohol before 6pm and after 11pm" or "No music after 10pm because we'll bother the neighbors" or "petting the cat is forbidden" or "smoking is only allowed on the balcony and only in the specific area that we previously marked on the floor with duct tape" or "you only get a second serving if you order your empty beer bottles according to their color, so it's easier to recycle them later
I'm hurt
Maybe I just had bad teachers, but we were never taught anything about the history of Switzerland
At all
Only in my last year of highschool did we talk about our country during ww1 and ww2, which really isn’t the most eventful subject
Once in University I learned about how Switzerland came to be, the wars between cantons, it’s relations with other countries, etc
But most importantly I wish we would have been taught the history of the swiss neutrality
I find it really interesting and can’t understand why it’s not more talked about given that it is such a big part of our national identity
That Rolex watches are made from Chinese/foreign components and then assembled in Switzerland to qualify for the Swiss made label

But I've had similar conversations on the same topic on this subreddit as well
I‘m sorry but that Texas German sounds like plain old German with an English accent, why would you say that it sounds nothing like any German dialect
Well, there's the global celebrity scandal wherein a famous director who is also a fugitive of the U.S. criminal justice system was invited to a film festival and promptly arrested at the airport
Then there's the more regional celebrity scandal of a weatherman whose ex-girlfriend accused him of rape which led to - you guessed it - his arrest at an airport
And a rather lengthy and unsatisfactory* trial, of course
In short: Swiss celebrity scandals really like an airport showdown
*Edit: I had misremembered the trial as unsatisfactory and stand corrected
There was a definite conclusion
I think it was the media circus around the procedures that left me with a bad aftertaste
Wow this is dark
Cool
Thanks
Honestly, I remember mainly that there was a lot of to and fro, including in the civil case(s?)
There were some halfway-between-the-sides decisions; I just never felt like there was a conclusion, really
Idk but once I understood what Migraine, Ride and (to an extent) Stressed Out are about I was kinda shocked I guess
And parents know this and are just ok with it
[TO THE MODS
I try to go once a year
Dentists are pretty expensive here, and not covered by the universal health insurance, so I can’t go much more often
How to calculate and pay taxes, buy houses or rent apartments
according to the memes it isn't thaught a lot in other countries
We learned about the holy roman emperor but I've never heard of the other thing you mentioned
How is that part of our history
Also it definitely wasn’t taught to me
Im sorry, I thought the question was just about things in general you learn at school
How to apply, deadlines, rights and obligations as a tenant, how much of your salary it should cost and those kind of things
but it's still helpfull to know if the landlord isn't doing what he's supposed to, and what I can do about it
It was banned at the federal level in 1938 by public referendum, and took effect in 1942, although for military convictions it was still possible until 1992 for treason
We banned it once before when revising the constitution in 1874, but this was revoked after a few years at the federal level
Some individual cantons kept the ban
Depends who you ask
Politicians - especially conservative ones - like to be very welcoming to expats regardless of where those expats are from because *money money money money*.
Regular people tend to be less enamored with expats because many of them don't bother to integrate themselves even a tiny little bit (a lot of them don't know a single word of German, even after years of living here)
Many also act very inappropriately because they don't know about Swiss customs and mentality (because they don't bother to learn about it)
Sadly, there's a very nasty double-standard in Switzerland and - arguably - in many other European countries too
If you're a poor immigrant, only the harshest of laws are good enough
You need to jump through hoops of fire just to get a job or learn the local language
You are constantly scrutinized and approached with a dose of xenophobia
The authorities will try anything they can to kick you out of the country again
But if you're a banking CEO for instance, the politicians will roll out the red carpet for you
Despite the fact that being a banker is probably the most unproductive job in the world and contributes far less to society than some poor immigrant who cleans toilets
Would be nice if it was like that
Apart from that, May 1 is not a holiday throughout the country
Holidays are not transferable in first hand
And in addition: 1st of May isn't a national holiday
In mainly catholic cantons 1st of November is a holiday instead of 1st of May
I take a shower a day after my morning exercise
If I am doing something that gets me hot and sweaty during the day, I will take another
I don't usually take baths and cannot recall the last one
I shower daily, sometimes every two days when I have no time
when I lived in Japan, I used to take a bath every day but here in Switzerland, I don't bathe at home at all
I have a pizza cutter
I've never heard of anyone cutting pizza with scissors, but I honestly can't say what people do in their kitchens, only that I have not seen it
I use a Swiss Army knife of course
Sometimes a CNC machine or chainsaw
Seriously though it's a pizza cutter
But will try a scissor next time
My mom alway cut them with scissors
When we used to live in Peru everybody thought it was the greatest idea ever

You then have to go around kissing every single female coworkers (3 times alternating on each cheek) as a thank you for coming to your workplace party of which you supplied the food

Ain't nobody got time for that
Goes both ways though because under the current setup Gégé shows up for a free Pain au Chocolat and now you have to exchange fake pleasantries

You might want to check out Eluveitie
They're actually better known in other countries than Switzerland
It's celtic-folk-metal
They often sing in Celtic
There's a Swiss German song called "De Ruef vo de Bärge".
From St
Gallen in the very east of Switzerland: [Knöppel - Prada] Goold old punk, even though the album is from 2016
&#x200B;
From your list:
*  Native language -> Tough German dialect from St
Gallen (different to standard German)
* National Instrument -> No
* Distinctive elements about the country: It's a rant against [this style] So as it's a rich style it could somehow count as yes
If you want and/or need a translation, I can do one for you
There is barely one and the original lyrics is written in dialect too, so you can't translate it with google
Eluveitie -Slania's song ( sung in Gaelic+ various folk instrument) or Inis Mona
I find it important that they help to reconstruct the old language to preserve it
E: want to add to possible entries: Tegernako, Your gaulish war, Uis elveti, omnos, Epona or Rebirth
Look up Eluveitie and Gotthard, they are the two most well known Swiss bands
I find Tegernako and your Gaulish war to be severly underrated
I saw them live when they were at a really small open air in my neighbouring village
Their studio is near there, so they agreed to play for like 100 spectators max
It was very cool
Indeed
Considering it's the same city, it's probably the actual intention
Oh your right . The dumb new Spotify UI just didn't show me the entire discography
I don't know whether it's exceptionally famous, but the European Court of ~~Justice~~ Human Rights recently declared the ban on begging in Switzerland to be a violation of human rights
I found it exciting when I heard about it, and as far as I know there was also a political outcry
As far as I know it's still banned (at least in most places)
And yes, there are fines
Not sure if the court ruling will really be enforced
The reason for the ban is that no-one who (legally) lives in Switzerland is forced to beg, as everyone can make use of the benefits of the social system
Additionally, it's a question of public safety (e.g. prevention of organized begging gangs) and urban image
Incidentally, begging means asking for money in public without any 'service in return': making music or making art is allowed if the city rules are complied with (e.g. no longer than 15 minutes in the same location), but sitting on the ground with a paper cup is not allowed
While some cities don't have beggars without a begging ban, it doesn't seem to work in others
So there certainly seems to be other/better alternatives than bans
Many people fear, however, that the cities in the future could look like, for example, in Germany at the moment
Zurich in particular has trauma from people sitting/lying around in the city center
Everybody definitely want to prevent that
> Various studies show that is social welfare that helps the poor
Most of these beggers aren't locals
I'm not sure they would get any social welfare anyway
> Is it true that welfare is required to be paid back in Switzerland
Yes if you're able
As someone living in Zürich: This is probably the biggest problem
Most beggars are simply people who came for a job or something else and don't really have the legal rights to be here and receive welfare payments if it doesn't work out
I've had many people come up to me just asking for money for a train ticket back home
You need to be able to pay without running into financial problems
It sounds a lot more harsh than it really is
The last thing the government wants is to push people back into the situation they were before where they rely on the state to take care of them
Yeah I thought it was a scam too sometimes but I'm a gullible guy when it comes to helping people \^\^ If he needs to lie to me to get a little bit of money I'm pretty sure he needs it more than me
Thanks for the heads up though
In my dialects, we just say "Danke". But I believe that there are some other dialects where the personal pronoun (in the dative case) is always attached and changes if you thank several people
This is different from your example, because the form changes with the number of people receiving the thanks, not the number of people thanking
The whole language minus some words we loaned from french and italian
I actually am one of those "men with long hair", lol
Here it's not really that common, but it's pretty much accepted
I have long hair and I don't feel like I get an abnormal amount of looks
a lot of people here are following the kind of top knot/manbun trend at the moment so it's not uncommon at all
when I lived in Japan it was a whole other story, I probably was the only blonde, long haired man in a 5km radius
In Switzerland it's rather outdated, it's kind of 1977
Guess, most people will view them as a pretty curiosity and a memento on bygone times
Also, "Bella ciao"
Say that we’re not really neutral, or that neutrality is not a good thing
To be fair, the misunderstanding is a little more understandable in other languages
Spanish

You know I’ve never heard a french speaking person get it wrong, so I’m not sure about this one
Fair enough, although I feel like the confusion in English stems often from the distinction between Swiss and Swedes, which I’ll admit sounds quite similar

What's Spanish
I understand a bit of Castellano, if that's what you mean, mainly because I speak French quite well
I know, I was being an annoying smartrarse
It just seems
not very nice to call one of the languages of Spain spanish, as if the others were lesser than Castellano for some reason
In Switzerland all four languages are equal, and to call one of them the Swiss language would be discriminating
Maybe you'd have less of a mess with separatist regions if you treated them more like equals
Why would Latin America be annoyed if the language were called Castilian
I don't hear the Irish or the Canadians complain about English being called English
Intact castles (usually museums nowadays): 20ish
It never occurred to be that that's a stat to keep track of
Ruins (aka
piles of rubble, which when viewed from the air look suspiciously like the outlines of a castle, and where archeologists have dug up some stuff) countless, they are basically on every more or less prominent hill
I could not tell you  even if I wanted to, there’s just so many
And my parents have been taking me to castles since I was a baby, so there’s many more I don’t remember

Does not compute
The discovery of the iron age Pfahlbauer at Swiss lakesides in mid 19th century
The modern Swiss state was founded then and they were desperately looking for historical ancestors to build their nationality on but didn't find anything they really liked
Then these Pfahlbauten were found
These were traces of iron age buildings built on wooden posts at lakesides
The politicians interpreted it as traces of a peaceful small people living neutrally on the lakes on their built islands while there was war going on on the land around them, just like they wanted to present Switzerland to the world
(Archaeologists nowadays know a lot more about Pfahlbauten and have rejected this romantic interpretation
Fondue
Cheese fondue
Or Raclette
Or any smelly cheese meal, really
I can‘t help myself, the stench of cheese makes me want to throw up

The second turn to the right, at the stop sign
Or is it meant as the second last right turn before the stop sign appears
On case 1, understandable
case 2, wtf
And the broken fence is great for saving time tbh, so you won't drive 15 minutes without noticing, for example
But then again, is the fence they're talking about still broken
Some Swiss do it too
it‘s not a must in all situations though
One time at my old high school a kid dropped a plate in the cafeteria
All 400~ students there started clapping
It was the beginning of the school year and no one dropped things after that lol
We have "Schmutzli" in Switzerland which is quite similair
Yeah thats the stereotype in Switzerland aswell
But this is where it gets weird
You guys are already spending more on healthcare (per capita) than [any other western country]
Lists are with public and private spending, although it's a 50/50 split in the US' case
So instead of spending it privately, you could already use it publicly instead, while also putting laws up to stop the overpricing of medical services like it is currently done
The thing with quality is about the government saving money on healthcare, which must be regulated that it doesn't happen, or not to a severe magnitude
**Make your goverment take care of it's citizens**
Not really that fundamental but if you can't cook basic dishes it's seen as a bit immature
I can't cook for shit and i'm honestly ashamed
I envy people who grew up with culinary knowledge from their family – Never really had great cooks in my family so I'm extremely amateurish in cooking proper dishes
I should maybe just buy a recipe book
Yeah, same here
Also baking is just a basic skill you should have before 18
Seems like a good approach, thanks :)
For most Swiss people, wages have indeed caught up with the high prices
Just to give you a vague idea: the median income per month in Switzerland is 6,500 CHF (8,670 Canadian Dollars)
If you only take Zurich, which is the most prosperous area in Switzerland, the median income per month shoots up to 7,500 CHF (10,000 Canadian Dollars)
This is, despite the fact that we pay a lot for food, clothing, insurance and many other things, still a good amount of money to live a comfortable life
Naturally, your personal situation also plays a role
If you have children, it's harder to make ends meet than if you don't. Couples without children have it the most comfortable
Again, just to give you an idea: one of my close friends that I know since high school works as a high school teacher
In Switzerland, this is a job with a high academic qualification threshold but it's also a well-respected job
Consequently, it pays well
My friend probably makes somewhere around 12,000 Canadian Dollars a month
His fiancé has a masters in psychology and probably earns pretty well too
maybe like 10,000 CAD a month
They don't have kids
So, this means together they make around 22,000 CAD every month
Even after taxes, insurance, rent and all the other high living expenses, this is enough money to go on nice vacation 3-4 times a year or save for your own house
Now, this may all sound very fine and dandy but there is a big caveat here
The truth is that, while most people in Switzerland are doing good, poor people are struggling particularly hard
I know this from personal experience because I'm on social benefits due to a lifelong physical disability
There are several reasons why life for poor people in Switzerland is very tough
For starters, our welfare system leaves room for improvement
Secondly, when you are on social benefits or you happen to be in a job that pays really crappy, all these things that you need or want seem unaffordable
Even just a single trip to the supermarket might feel scary because things are just so expensive for you
The worst part about being poor in Switzerland, however, has to do with human psychology
In a country where you are surrounded by well-off people, barely scraping by REALLY sucks
I often say that being poor in a rich country is even worse than being poor in a poor country
If I'm a poor guy in, say, Cambodia, there's at least a good chance that I'll be surrounded by many other folks who are in the exact same situation
This makes me feel protected and like I'm a part of a community
Of course it's still not nice to live in a shed but I've got all these friends and together we can help each other because we all know what it's like
In Switzerland, poor people feel extremely isolated from the rest of society
When I look at my friends, I see all these people who go on fancy vacations, buy themselves all sorts of electronic gadgets, live in big apartments etc
They tell me they understand me but I don't believe they truly do
Our lives are simply too different
It's hard not to feel envious or bitter when you're in this situation because it feels like the rest of society has left you behind
Ironically, because the Swiss model works so amazing for such a large part of the population, it is especially painful for those individuals where who don't get a piece of the pie (for whatever reason that may be)
Wages compensate the COL, but the big caveat no one talks about compared to (say) the U.S is that you don't get to save as much money
In 5 years living/working in the U.S (NYC metro), I saved about 2
5X what I have in Switzerland (Geneva) despite earning 60% more (also 5 years)
> even weekend work
Swiss labour laws are generally quite lax, but that sounds more like your friends got taken advantage of
Expected to work weekends, without being granted advantages elsewhere, is more something that can happen when you reach very high Swiss salaries
Otherwise, it could represent a breach of a sectorial collective bargaining agreement
Most Swiss work 40-42 hours per week
The limit is 45h by law
I made out with a girl i just met while motley crue were playing kickstart my heart in concert
In Austria
None
Other regions joining us is more likely than any secession movement getting any traction
The only secession movement we had was french speaking Berne
They still wanted to be part of Switzerland tough, just as an independent Canton and not part of Canton Berne
Thats how Canton Jura became our 26th Canton in 1979
"population movements" is a nice way to put it
The occasional Genevian wanders by sometimes
Jokes aside, we have plenty of wild animals, deer, fox, boar, mountain goats, hedgehogs, etc
that wander around
Plenty of "farm cats" which are technically stray I guess, but we don't consider them that way since they also technically have a home on a farm
So I guess my answer would be no, we have no strays and so they aren't a problem
It is pretty much a kid only event here, unless the parents of a kid might be a godparent or relative, and even then, it is still weird to stay for long
Maybe grandparents might be there helping the parents a bit
By the time my kids were in school (age 6 or so) we would just send them on public transport alone to the party if they knew the place
No, we don't. The higher you go in education you'll meet people from wider and wider regions which kind of teaches you more and more dialects just by communicating
At first it's only minor differences but the further you go the more extreme it gets
After military service, where you meet people from all over the country at once, you'll finally get the big picture of it
Think it's mostly due to that I'm able to  pinpoint which region someone grew up in, usually even in which part of a canton
Porchetta sandwich in Rosetta bread
My favorite sandwiches ever
**"Lampredotto/Panino con Bollito w/spicy sauce" : Da Nerbone (Mercato Centrale), Florence Italy**. It's insane how good it is for something so seemingly simple
An absolutely MUST TRY in my opinion
**"Cheesesteak wiz wit" : Pat's King of Steaks, Philadelphia PA USA**. I've had just about every steak in the city
There's something about Pats that just does IT for me
Probably mostly nostalgia, nothing wrong with that
**"The Fat Bitch with Hot sauce" : Grease Trucks @ Rutgers University, New Brunswick NJ USA
** When you shove a cheesesteak, mozzarella sticks, chicken fingers, fries, mayo, ketuchup, lettuce, tomato and hot sauce in one sandwich you get magic
Drunken greasy magic
But magic
**"Butifarra" : La Lucha, Lima Peru
** Italians brought this recipe to Catalonia who then took it to the new world and the natives modified it with local ingredients
It's an explosion of interesting flavors true to Peruvian cuisine
Like the ceviche of sandwiches
I can go on and on
Good to hear that :)
How the fuck does the far right care more, it just came out that they basically planed to sell the country to Russia .
Switzerland, can't tell why tho
I choose Switzerland because I have been here all my life and like it
First we ge a room and kissing costs extra
Switzerland
because that's where I grew up and I love it
And for the chocolate
Also less unemployment than German (don't know about Austria)
&#x200B;
I think I would like it in all 3 of them, though
I have lived in all three and I’d pick Switzerland for the beautiful mountains, quality of life, public transportation and the political system
Although Vienna and Berlin are more fun to live in
Switzerland of course
But if I had to choose it would be Germany because  Austria is too similar to Switzerland
Wish fulfilled
You live in the Romansh speaking part of Switzerland
Oh wait, this ain't r/TheMonkeyspaw
I don't know what's up with the hate thing
I have no issues with Germans at all, that's just old, conservative people who have that
However, if you move here, we do expect you to get used to Swiss German after a while
If you are in a group of Swiss people, they don't want to have to speak standard German just because of one person
Btw I would probably also choose Wien but Zürich is nice too so it's kinda hard
Lugano is getting international finally, after years of being a place without NOTHING to do for fun
I would have expected more people to use this argument
You guys just need to see the salaries and taxes here and you would choose Switzerland in the blink of an eye
Why not interested ?
Same, just the other way around :)
Lol, please explain
I wanna know
Why
It is, at least in my opinion
We did extensive studies and have assurance that we’re fun
The fudge
Yeah it's expensive but at the end of the day, the average worker definitely has more money leftover after all expenses are paid
That's also why moving to another country as a Swiss person usually kinda sucks financially
unless you don't plan on returning
Yes, but your purchasing power is still higher
A chum, isch doch käs problem
Wait
So, North Korea is not in the news in Denmark
How
Vo Chäs het da gar niemert gredt ihr knödelfrässer
If you have an abonnement it's decently affordable - but for single trips it's extremely expensive
The whole system is geared for commuters and abonnements (which are mainly used by commuters) are heavily subsidized, single trips are not
Yes, that's basically the way it is
Either you use public transport regularly and have a yearly or monthly pass (whether that's one just for your region or for all of Switzerland depends on where you have to travel regularly)
These passes (abonnements) are not cheap but easily worth it even if you only use public transport once or twice a week
If you don't use public transportat often enough to justify buying a pass you'll never use it because it's just so damn expensive
All the time
Nothing is concentrated in a single city
The highest criminal court, the highest civil court and the seat of government are all in different cities, for example
It's part of us being a federation of somewhat independent cantons, not a centralised state like France
I mean officially we don't even have a capital, Bern is just the de facto capital because welp
the damn building has to be some where
Not really no, the federal assembly and the federal council are in Bern and the federal tribunal is in Lausanne
Switzerland is a very decentralized country
Officially we don't, but if the Zürchers ask then it's Bern
They love to hear that
'Vendredi ou les limbes du pacifique' which is the french nsfw version of Robinson Crusoe
Maybe I would see it differently now, but when I was 15 I thought it was quite awful
Our teacher made the mistake of reading Hermann Hesse's "Der Steppenwolf" as the first book in "high school" (Gymnasium)
We were 15/16
i loved Faust I. as for Faust II my teacher was like "oh we‘re not gonna bother with part II, it‘s too long and not that interesting, you can read that on your own if you really want to"
That's gonna confuse the shit out of computer science people where "nonce" is a number or string only used once
Most often used in cryptographic contexts
It didn't fall out of use, it's simply the only word for "honour". Rather, the concept itself was regarded as somewhat unmodern
The French don't always carry a baguette around with them and the Germans aren't angry but actually very nice people
There are angry people of course, but not more than in other places
Pro gun Americans know nothing of Switzerland
I say that as a Swiss gun owner
Their fantasy view of Switzerland is incorrect, and our system only works with respect, a sense of community and the greater good, strict regulations and oversight, and a social network well beyond what America has
I am annoyed they use us as an example all the time
We have the Eu directive with exemptions now, anyway, so I hope it ends
To be clear, the attitude towards guns here is diverse and complex, so it isn't some sort of gun utopia
Many Swiss dislike guns, some see them as a necessary thing, and some like them, so we are not a homogeneous group
None of us want anything like the shit storm of America
I really know fuck all about US gun laws but I can tell you one thing:
If we ever (god forbid) have anything close to what happened in the US in the past few days, things would just change
Fast
We had one soldier nutcase randomly shoot a girl at a bus station which led to all soldiers having to hand back the government issued ammo (sealed box of ammo stored at home in case of war)
We're very pragmatic in this regard
Your right to shiny toys ends when people lose their lives
>hey believe banning guns will only leave it to the hands of the 'bad' guys
Well
Are they wrong
Criminals, by definition, got the name by breaking the law
They won't just suddenly lose all interest in firearms just because some new law passed and given that American homes are overflowing with guns, they'll be able to keep themselves stocked up easily by grabing those (which is already where a large part of the crime guns come from - gangs killing eachother with stolen firearms)
>And also it will not be able to remove guns from the public
They've got a point given the unique situation they're in
* The US already has many guns around (the last figure estimate I heard was 400-450 million)
* Private sales often don't require a paper trail depending on different state laws, so for all intents and purposes those weapons are "unregistered". ("What, you mean that gun I own according to that 4473 form
Sold that one 2 years ago, privately for cash
No receipt and I forgot the name, sorry
* The way they define a firearm legally (for example, only the lower receiver of an AR15, or the grip of a handgun are the actual "firearms" - the barrels, uppers, slides and everything else aren't serialized and freely available)
* You can produce [your own (unserialized) versions] of those regulated parts as long as your primary intention wasn't to sell them (a.k.a. oops, I made a bunch of guns and *somebody* stole them)
The thing is, those 400 million won't just disappear once you outlaw them and short of going house to house for confiscation (which will *definitely* lead to a lot of bloodshed) they don't have a way to check or keep track of them either
Guns also don't have a shelf life so even if you'd ban *everything new starting now*, the ones already out there would last a century or two easily
For comparison: people are [still shooting pre-WW1 era guns that are 140 years old by now]
>Do you believe the Swiss model where so many people own guns yet has rare occurrences of mass shootings, is feasible in rest of Europe, and America
Our gun laws aren't the reason why we don't shoot eachother often, in fact they're more loose than what a lot of US states currently have
For example: all handguns and semiautomatic rifles are covered under the same shall-issue permit / we can purchase and own select-fire weapons / the army hands you one to take home with you if you're in a function that gets a Sig 550
We have a more culturally homogenous society, better social security nets, we actually lock our dangerous mental cases away etc
and our gun culture *generally* revolves around competition or protecting the collective (e.g. as part of the citizen militia/army), while in the US it revolves around self-protection and as an intended failsafe against government
They don’t know anything about Swiss laws
Anyone that has a military issued weapon in Switzerland is part of the army and has gone through extensive training, background check and all
It is illegal to use it or carry the gun unless you are on your way to the military service
If you use it at home for self defense (home invasion or anything else) you are not allowed to use that weapon and you will be found guilty of inappropriate use of force
I don't think comparing wildly different countries makes much sense and I've never heard someone argue a **ban** would be useful
There's a big difference between a ban and stricter regulations
In my opinion, the gun ownership rate is not an issue per se
The quality of gun ownership is
A good system needs to make sure every gun owner is reasonably trained and has no criminal record, no history of violence, addiction, or mental health issues
The Swiss system does that
Then there's the gun owner's attitude
That's cultural and needs to be addressed as such, no law can improve it
Swiss gun owners, generally speaking, don't feel threatened and don't walk around armed
Last one in my hometown in 2001
>infinitely more strict than (the average) American gun laws
I would disagree on that: the main difference is carry laws which are lax in the US while in Switzerland basically only LEOs can carry
What kind of merits do you see
>has gone through extensive training
Hahaha
>It is illegal to use it or carry the gun unless you are on your way to the military service
Except it's not
>If you use it at home for self defense (home invasion or anything else) you are not allowed to use that weapon and you will be found guilty of inappropriate use of force
You can, just not in most cases
It also depends on mitigating circumstances
>A good system needs to make sure every gun owner is reasonably trained and has no criminal record, no history of violence, addiction, or mental health issues
The Swiss system does that
Our system doesn't do that mate
>good system needs to make sure every gun owner is reasonably trained
Please explain to me how the Swiss system does that
>where citizens are issued with an assault rifle which they effectively keep at home (with ammo)
Ammo isn't supplied anymore to soldiers since 2008
You can also choose wether to have a rifle/handgun or not and store it in arsenals instead of your home
Also unlike what everyone is thinking, military service is actually not mandatory
What's mandatory is the conscription during which you decide if you want to do the army
Except they're not good and full of shit on our legislation
They are mostly based around soldiers keeping their weapons at home and keeping them ( in a deactivated semi-automatic only version) permanently after service
This concept of an armed civilian populace has been a tradition for hundreds of years, and some, including me, would argue it is an important part of Swiss tradition
It is a complex thing and would take pages to explain
Swiss people follow rules we agree to as a group, we don't look for loopholes in the law to exploit, we follow the laws we created
If you don't like a law, change it through the system
We don't have bile and hate for opposition parties, they are Swiss too, just those with a different opinion
The laws are applied fairly and evenly and people here trust the government, the police, and the courts to do what is correct
We see these things as US, not THEM like in the US
We have a semi direct democracy where the people decide what the laws should be on many important issues that have real impact on our lives
I think the average Swiss feels a part of the government process rather than a pawn like in the US
This goes a long way in creating a sense of community and common good
As for community, Switzerland is rather decentralized
We have a federal government, but more power is with the cantons (like states) and the cantonal governments
This means decisions are local, and often delegated to the towns
Swiss people inside Switzerland identify themselves to one another by their canton
It is sort of like US states, but much more of the power is local, so there is a greater sense that you are your neighbors are in this together
I see myself as a resident of my town, then my canton, then Switzerland
The town in which you live isn't just a place, it is often history and your family's place of origin (an important thing in Swiss tradition that would take pages to explain)
I see myself as part of the town
The community
My family has lived here for at least 600 years, and in 600 more we will still be here
We ARE the town, so we care deeply about it
We care about the school, the old people, the parks, our neighbors, etc
It belongs to US; It is US
On a larger scale, we are a nation of independent cantons that decided to align and work together
There is a common theme there, one of working together on the larger goal of a nation, and despite our significant differences in language and culture, we see the common ground and focus on that to keep a national sense of community
On the social network front, we have a firm social support system so no one in Switzerland goes to bed hungry or wonders how they will feed their kids
There are job programs, mental health programs, immigrant integration programs, language programs for outsiders, and too many other things to list
If you need help here, it is available
There is no shame in it
I see the health and welfare of my fellow citizens as important to the health of the nation and the quality of my own life
The first section of our constitution states that a society is measured in strength by  the well being of its weakest members
I really believe this
When there are problems, we look to help and fix them, not blame people
There is a bond of community here that makes you care about your fellow Swiss
I can ramble on for hours, but suffice it to say that our two societies are very different in origin and attitudes, and this is reflected in how we think, deal with problems, and treat each other
I just gave a few concepts, some of which are probably true in parts of America as well, but here it is a combination of all of them, plus others that are more difficult to explain, that make our country work
When it all works, people are happy and content, and there is no need for crime, shootings, and the like
No, they are not accurate, at least not entirely
There is for example, no training requirement to own a gun here, no magazine capacity, no reason to justify ownership, no real safe storage laws, no real official waiting period, no resrtiction on private ammunition, and so on
Lots of missing information there and some misrepresentation of Swiss laws by omission
Of course, not a single bit of the videos matter any more as we recently voted to comply with he European Union Firearms Directive, with a few accommodations, so these laws do not represent current (or at least imminently pending) Swiss law
They're full of shit on many things (but that was to be expected)
We're ethnically diverse (about a quarter of our population are foreigners), but most of them come from the same broad cultural background (judeo-christian-influenced, western European)
plus we don't really have clashing subcultures like in the US (e.g. "damn those n*ggers" vs
"white people are to blame for everything")
In that aspect we're pretty homogenous (as in "people agree on and respect the same broader foundation of values and procedures")
>and read that gun owners are screened and trained before they can have a gun (correct me if I’m wrong, though)
Well you're indeed wrong:
The only "screening" is asking for a record extract that doesn't have to be empty (same in the US if you want to buy a gun in a Walmart or any other shop), and no training is ever required in order to own guns
What are you talking about
I beg to differ
A large percentage of the male population is military-trained and an equally large percentage of the privately owned guns are army-issued
I don't have the statistics rn but I'll try to find them
All the males in my family who have gone through conscription have kept theirs and were taught the proper way to store them to make them harmless for anyone else
I don't know about my father's, but my uncle's generation for sure wasn't even given ammos for them
Meaning, our culture sees these weapons as the the last line of defence in case of national threat
They are meant to be handled only by people who were trained to do so, they are meant to defend the country, they aren't for personal use
Another huge percentage are bound to be for hunting and shooting clubs
So, the people using them receive training as well
And they're often not something you can walk around and keep hidden anyway
Buying anything else requires a permit that's issued after a background check
Carrying permits are quite rare and require further examination of one's handling skills and safety awareness
Finally, like I said, Swiss gun culture is very different from American gun culture
Our citizens usually trust the government, the police, and their surroundings and leave their guns and rifles at home unless they're going hunting
I'd be curious to know how your experience differs, mate
A very large percentage of our guns are army-issued and therefore owned by people who have been military-trained
Another large percentage of gun owners belong to shooting clubs, often from a relatively young age
A carrying permit requires further examination of one's handling skills and safety awareness
Reasonable force has to be used, but it also depends on mitigating circumstances
The law only says it shouldn't be accessible from an unauthorized party
Legally your locked front door is enough
Also the police has no right to come and check how your weapons are locked unless you own one from the *generally prohibited* category such as a full-auto (you know, the ones banned in the US since 1986)
To me the biggest merit is the fact that in Switzerland the NRA does not exist and no one is putting fear into people about the fact that some day someone may want to get your guns
Apparently about some things you aren't fully aware of how they work
Edit: my formulation feels a little aggressive, it was not my intention
>A large percentage of the male population is military-trained
Only 14% of the population goes to the army each year, that's not large, albeit more than in the US
>and an equally large percentage of the privately owned guns are army-issued
Army-issued rifles aren't accounted for in private owbership
Even if, only less than 25% of army-issued firearms are bought at the end of service
Though it's true it was unchecked before and we have no prior data
>Meaning, our culture sees these weapons as the the last line of defence in case of national threat
They are meant to be handled only by people who were trained to do so, they are meant to defend the country, they aren't for personal use
That's only for the part that actually serves, and even then it's not true for everyone
Anyone can buy a full-auto legally in Switzerland, which is not the case in the US as they are banned since 1986
>Carrying permits are quite rare and require further examination of one's handling skills and safety awareness
That doesn't impact your initial statement though
A regular gun owner has nothing to do with someone with a carry license
>So, the people using them receive training as well
For hunting
Yes as there's a license to get
In ranges
No as no training is ever required in order to buy
But it's true that after a while you're somewhat trained
>Buying anything else requires a permit that's issued after a background check
Yes but anything can be acquired with a record and "history of violence, addiction, or mental health issues" aren't checked
Heck it's even illegal to do so in most cases
Also in case you didn't know, in order to buy **any** firearm in a US shop, you need to fill in an ATF form 4473 which is a way more invasive and prohibitive WES that has a mandatory background check
>Swiss gun culture is very different from American gun culture
Our citizens usually trust the government, the police, and their surroundings and leave their guns and rifles at home unless they're going hunting
I won't argue that our culture is different than the US one, but your initial argument was flawed
We don't make sure everyone is reasonably trained as there's no requirement, the background check doesn't need to be empty, history of violence can only be checked if it was reported to the police or resulted in an arrest (and it's not even a veto), and finally addiction or mental health issues are protected by medical secret and cannot be accessed by the police
Then misinform me with your knowledge
That second amendment foundation seems prime avenue to spread more fear mongering
Only in the US things like that are considered valuable
>misinform me
That's very dishonest of you
>has gone through extensive training
You clearly never went to the army nor work with soldiers to say that
I've seen more rule violations and dangerous handling during one Obligatorischschiessen than in 10 years working in a shooting range
The training the recruits go through is poor to say the least
>It is illegal to use it or carry the gun unless you are on your way to the military service
You can absolutely use your service rifle outside of the army and it's perfectly legal to transport to somewhere other than your base or your home
Usage of your issued rifle outside of the army is even encouraged
>If you use it at home for self defense (home invasion or anything else) you are not allowed to use that weapon and you will be found guilty of inappropriate use of force
You can, just not in most cases as indeed reasonable force has to be used
It also depends on mitigating circumstances
If you call Swiss training poor then you have certainly never seen the US requirements
A 30 min video is all they need and in most cases zero
I did do my service by the way
You are certainly not allowed to carry your gun anywhere you want, your examples have very strict rules
>If you call Swiss training poor then you have certainly never seen the US requirements
The fact it's poorer someplace else doesn't take away the fact it's not "extensive training". That is a huge overstatement
>You are certainly not allowed to carry your gun anywhere you want, your examples have very strict rules
To be tacky "anywhere you want" is a stretch but "anywhere" would be technically true depending on the destination
My point was that you said it's illegal to carry unless you're going to the army, which is wrong given there's instances where you can go someplace else legally while carrying
Albeit it is without magazine inserted
Depends on your life goals
For example I would say I have decent disposable income but buying my own place is almost impossible considering I can't get a bank loan unless I have half a million swiss francs to put down as a deposit
My rent is about 4
5K a month
A mortgage is much cheaper
No offense taken
I suggest you play around with the UBS Mortgage calculator
Even if you're earning 100K a year you won't be able to afford the 600K CHF flat by putting down 120K as the downpayment
You need to put down at least 140K.
And 600K for a flat is unheard of in Geneva
You're looking at minimum 1M to 1
5M for a 2 BR
Geneva
Using non-Swiss terms a 3 BR, 2
5 bath, about 130m with one indoor parking spot
FYI I've been in the market to buy and something similar is 1
9M - 2
3M.
For the masochists
There are some new developments but half of them are social housing (which is super controversial among some groups), and the other half are based on a lottery
There are also cooperatives, which I think are pretty cool but also miserable to deal with
\>There's a 120m2 apartment in there for 660k.
Read the details
The value is 1
5M.
It's one of those situations where you pay the seller 680K, and then 1
5K a month  as rent and let the seller live there until they die
Popular for the elderly to do
Yes, it happens from time to time because I predominantly converse in English in my everyday life
It's not something I'm proud of though
In fact, it makes a bit sad
I used to have an excellent active vocabulary in German (all of my German teachers used to tell me that I should become a novelist) but since my English improved dramatically, especially after living in the US, my active German vocabulary has decreased
In normal everyday life conversations it's not very much noticeable but as soon as I'm trying to write something elevated, be it creative writing or a paper for uni, my mind goes blank on all the great German words that are out there
Same
I speak swiss german with my friends but sometimes my brain throws in random english words because it can‘t come up with the swiss german word
I think it‘s because when for example talking about movies/tv shows (which I watch in English) my brain connects it with the English language
But it‘s okay, my friends do it too and we understand each other
I hate translating word for word
I usually know what the word means and can use it in context but I can‘t translate it back to German
Finnish, or maybe Swedish
Swedish is my favorite Nordic language
Faroese = then listen to Eivør ! :)
There is also /u/lolidkwtfrofl
Specifically in the case of Swiss I wish we had an imperfect (preterite) tense
There are situations where it would make the language quite a bit more elegant than if everything is always expressed in present perfect
One thing that bothers me about German (as well as Swiss) is that they are absolutely horrible languages to use in the bedroom
Like, you just *cannot* sound hot when you dirty talk in German
No matter how hard you try, you will end up sounding either creepy or super cringy in 100% of the cases
We have a million different names for the genitals but they are all so
corny, gross, weird
just not nice
In fact, there's even a [song] about this by the former German band Joint Venture
We have the exact same thing in Swiss German
We use „Kolleg“ („Colleague“) for our non bf/gf friends, which is really confusing to anyone who is a non-Swiss but speaks German
You can also say the wonderful sentence „Er isch ned min Fründ, mir sind nur befründet
“ and it‘s completely logical
This literally translates to „He‘s not my friend, we‘re just friends
“ (meaning ofc „He‘s not my bf
I just imagined dirty talk in Swiss German and it definitely sounds like a porn parody, haha
What also annoys me with Swiss German is this:
EN: The friend with whom I went to school (*or* who I went to school with)
DE: Der Freund, mit dem ich zur Schule ging
CH: Dä Kolleg (mit dem) woni (demit) id Schuel bin - wtf
Does anyone have a better solution for this
France - shitshow incoming
Germany - feelbadsman
Italy - shitshow
Liechtenstein - No differences
Austria - idk

I don't know, we never really had family gatherings due to there not being a family
Also, there wouldn't have been other kids
We always had a kids table in my family during gatherings
It was mostly because the main table wasn’t large enough to sit everyone, so us kids would sit at a smaller one together
Of course for our regular everyday meal we would sit with our parents at the same table, but when the cousins, the aunts, the uncles and the grand-parents come over you gotta make room
Same for me, and for my children
We always had one on one side of the family but not on the other
The table was just too small to fit everyone at our paternal-grandparents, so a kids-table was the natural solution
Actually we still sit at a separate table on Christmas, even though the average age at the 'kids'-table is now early to mid-twenties (some of the cousins now bringing partners has not at all helped relieve the issue of too small tables xD)
No, no one would care
The Swiss Federal Supreme Court has 38 judges with seven different chambers ranging from 5-6 judges each
Swiss French and their septante (70), huitante (80) and nonente (90) will prevail
On the serious side, I don't know if it's because I'm used to these numbers or what, but I've always found the France French way to say them as a complexification that doesn't need to be
The Swiss way is the way to go
Septante, huitante, nonante master race
Dutch really looks like the forbidden child of German and English
There must be a little over 1 million of us who use septante, huitante, nonante out of over 300 million french speakers in the world
So we truly are the elite of french
I want to keep that as much as possible, but I'm starting to hear so much people saying quatre-vingts in Switzerland it's alarming
lots of cold War age bunkers here are used for lounge rooms and common rooms for children, or for sports rooms
However, most of them still have maintenance requirements so that they can be used quickly in an emergency
Not sure if there are (abandoned) bunkers of foreign military forces at all
I don't even know what foreign forces are or were stationed here tbh
I don't think that any troops are stationed here, that would compromise neutrality I would think
I know that there are Liaison Officers (Ger
Verbindungsoffiziere) of various armed forces in Switzerland but I wouldn't call them troops stationed here (even though technically they are) as they are as far as I know stationed at their nations embassy

Although it's more dialect than Swiss standard (although many Swiss people don't know that),  "springen" in Switzerland means "running" as well as "jumping" (dialectal "gumpe" for "jumping" isn't used), whereas it means only "jumping" in Germany
So you can read phrases like "Um sich abzureagieren, ging er um um den Block springen

That is complete news to me

We have high hopes but we will definitely lose at the first elimination round as always
we have the potential to go far but we'll bottle it in the round of 16 against Macedonia after defeating Italy and topping our group
French, I think it sounds beautiful, but it's so hard to learn
I im general love minority languages and heavy dialects
Also great to see such a local identity florish imo
English , and I love the British accent
Is Ataturk unpopular in Greece because of the Izmir thing
It does happen in Switzerland
English has replaced French/German as the main medium of communication between the different language areas, people are less and less bothered about learning any other language other than your own and English
I am not disagreeing with your premise, but to offer some counter-thoughts: that would only replace a language in a trivial way if the elements didn't also wither away like regular language (but more at an increased rate, because foreign elements are especially subject to fashion)
For example, much of the trendy French lingo of the 19th century or Latin/Greek one before that has disappeared from European languages
English isn't safe either: anecdotally, I used "cool" in my childhood 20 years ago but don't anymore, and haven't heard it used IRL for a very long time
Using "cool" has become "uncool". Similarly, "epic" (or the translation "episch") was omnipresent lingo 12 years ago but nowhere now
They are well known among history buffs, but not among the general pop like your examples; [Swiss mercenaries] and [Landsknechte]
Right now
No better time than the present
Definitely not the 80's. I was in gymnasium in the 80's, then the Swiss army
I do not want to go back to the 80's.
Today's present was a possible future once
How depressing if you think the future can't get better
A bit depressing

There's a scene in SpongeBob SquarePants where Mr Krabs is visited by the Flying Dutchman and tries to get him to leave by telling him he isn't Eugene Krabs, he's "Harold Flowers" (because a flower is standing right beside him)
In the German version, he calls himself "Benjamin Blümchen" - "Blümchen" literally means "little flower", so it still fits his quick glance to the flower vase
However, the joke is made much better by the fact that Benjamin Blümchen is a well-known character from a German childrens' TV show - who was coincidentally voiced by the same voice actor as Mr Krabs
So Mr Krabs is just saying "I'm not Eugene Krabs
I'm..." in his normal voice and then he completely switches to his calm "Benjamin Blümchen" voice while saying his fake name
[Here's the scene in German
Edit: [Picture of Benjamin Blümchen]
In Switzerland, there are 9 of them
What is notable is that they are not directly in the big cities but in their surroundings (about 10-30 kilometres)
9 and the first IKEA outside of Scandinavia
there's 11stores in Switzerland
Also, they all are directly near a highway
So about 1 per 950k people
Looking at other comments, I guess it makes sense that we have a higher Ikea density than some larger countries like France or Germany
But compared to smaller countries, it still is quite a lot
I feel like we don’t really belong to any group of country
Here in the french speaking part I feel closer to France and therefore western Europe, but maybe german speakers feel closer to central Europe and italian speakers closer to Italy and southern Europe
I can’t say for them though, so it’s just an assumption
But as a whole, we’re just that donut hole in the middle of Europe
All Swiss people agree that we're Switzerland
I would say Switzerland, but we're our own thing because of the cultural differences
The people who think that way usually are nationalists to an unhealthy degree
Not everyone, but in voting those regions still are generally dark red
I wouldn't, we have our own identity
Yes I do
Why would one want to track all the dirt from outside into the house

I am also "the trailing spouse" and have been lucky to also find work here
I should be getting my red passport in the coming year or so, to give you an idea of how much I like it here :D
Switzerland and Lichtenstein are really close
Lichtenstein even uses the Swiss franc as currency, Swiss police, the Swiss army defense, Swiss customs control, and the Swiss postal service
I see them as a canton that opted to not join the confederation, choosing rather to have their own independence, but there is so much in common between us that it still feels like home there
Even their decision to not join is a very Swiss like attitude
I would disagree a lot with this
Now if you had said Bavaria and Austria ...
Look at Swiss interactions with NATO, the EU, and the UN
We tend not to join a lot of things, or we spend a lot of time really thinking about it
Also, Swiss people don't like anyone, including other Swiss people
I'm pretty sure we're not technically allied in that kind of sense, but if war broke out and Liechtenstein was dragged into it, they would probably request help from us

Oxygen - Sauerstoff (sour stuff)
Edit: "Stoff" in this case is translated into substance/material and not "stuff"
Swiss German is widely spoken in everyday life by all age groups despite the official language being German (yes, that's a different language)
I grew up close-ish to the romansh speaking region(s)
There the situation seems no be different, I had multiple friends at school who spoke romansh at home but more or less only spoke Swiss German the rest of the time
That's a hard one to answer
Yes, kinda, maybe
In my not at all representative experience most immigrants end up with a somewhat unfortunate semi Swiss German
The problem is Swiss German is not standardized so it's near impossible to learn in a structured sort of way (there are basically no courses, no textbooks etc
Most take German courses and learn German (which already is not an easy Language) and then build on that
Which means they often use German vocab or Grammar within otherwise Swiss German sentences - sounds a bit odd but usually it's workable
Second Generation immigrants (and people that came to Switzerland when they were children) usually end up with a very good level of Swiss German (maybe with a bit of an accent but not more), because it's the language spoken on playgrounds, in sportsclubs and in school, at least among peers
In my (again very subjective) experience all of this is true for any immigrants except for Germans, who tend to just keep on speaking German (just see the German responses on this comment thread - they think of Swiss German as an accent or at best dialect which does not warrant the effort to learn it)
Exactly
Little things like "Treppe" instead of "Stäge" or "Karotten" instead of "Rüebli"
Tried to argue this point multiple times already with this user, they won't listen
Fact is the distinction between language and dialect can not be drawn clearly when coming from a purely linguistical standpoint
It's largely a political or cultural line
I have never met a Swiss German native speaker who sees Standard German and Swiss German as dialects of the same language
And from that standpoint I argue quite confidently that Swiss German is not a German dialect but it's own, distinct language
"Pferd" instead of "Ross", "Kartoffeln" instead of "Herdöpfel", "ihchaufe" instead of "posta".
But there are also grammatical things, the example I have in mind is "I war wandera" perfectly fine by German grammar "Ich war wandern", but in Swiss German the Präteritum form doesn't exist so the proper translation would be "I bin ga wandera" (Perfekt form with "bin ga")
The selection is surprisingly quite robust in Geneva
You have high/low ends of every kind of food
But similar to other comments in this thread
The Mexican restaurants (there are at least 4) are pretty bad

We have many different cuisines but I have heard quite some people say that the dishes the restaurants generally serve are not comparable to the dishes in the original country

It reminds me of the lyrics "si tu ne m’aimes pas, je t’aime" meaning 'if you don’t love me, I love you' from the opera Carmen by Bizet
The Swiss are all very closed and don't like small talk at all
Plus there's a shit ton of rules which the all take veeery seriously, even the smallest "fuck up" can get you mad looks and in extreme cases even light insults
Also it seems that everybody here just lives for career, money, career, work, career
No one really "lives" here
Well I live in the German (biggest) part so I don't know much about the other ones
It's pretty much all Swiss parts i've been to
They all follow the rules so strictly it's annoying
Now, I'm not saying that you should be a total rebel and do what you want
But come on, people get sooo damn mad at eachother for such small things, like when someone quickly walks over a mostly empty street without using a zebra crossing
Who cares
Edit: Better wording
No, they usually don't like to talk more than absolutely necessary
Well, I've never had kebab before
Zurich and Geneva are both located not very centrally and were already very developed, so they wouldn't have had the space to house government buildings
secondly, the two largest language groups French and Swiss German are both appeased a bit, since Bern is kind of in the middle of those two areas (despite being mostly Swiss German)
another fun fact is that we officially don't have a capital city, the government is just seated in Bern, so it's the de-facto capital
We technically don‘t have one
We only habe a Ville fédérale, where the government and parliament are
Back in the day, the government switched cities every year or every two years
When modern switzerland was founded, three cities where candidates: Zürich, Bern and Luzern
In the end parliament voted for Bern, because it was relatively close to the big french speaking part of switzerland
This isn't quite accurate
I mean, it's very oversimplified
Originally, the government would move from one city to an other a very year or so
There were 4-5 cities in rotation, including Baden, Zürich, Freuenfeld, and Luzern in early Switzerland, and then Fribourg, Soleure, Lucerne, Berne, Zurich and Basel during the Napoleon era
Finally, only Zurich, Bern and Luzern post-Napoleon
When it was time to decide on a more stable system, Zurich was "disqualified" as it already held the most economic power, and they wanted to keep power more balanced
Luzern pas "disqualified" because it had led the Sonderbund in the swiss civil war
This was a Catholic rebellion, against the Protestants that wanted to centralise the gouvernement (basically the catholics were afraid that a protestant central power would be bad for them
This is very, very, oversimplified)
So that left Bern, who had agreed to give land to the federation for free to set up the infrastructure
Bern is more central and more popular with the Swiss-French
Officially though, Bern isn't the Capital, as the "Capital" is wherever the gouvernement chooses to assemble, and according to our Constitution, it can assemble wherever it wants
But why assemble anywhere else if you already have buildings and offices built in Bern
Also, the Federal Tribunal is seated in Lausanne, not Bern, to further "balance the power".
Edit : cleaned up stray words
If you want to tell someone you don't care about what they're saying to you right now you can tell them one of the following
- "läck du mir am tschöpli" (go and lick my jacket/shirt)
- "rutsch mir de puggel ab" (slide down my back)
- "blos mir id schueh" (blow into my shoes)
Those are Swiss German, don't think they even translate to German

My history teacher kept saying that
We used to have a nuclear weapons program
(I don't think most Swiss know either, tho
Switzerland has a surprisingly high rate of gun ownership
Wow I didn't know that
Does that mean that "Die Hard" is not a Christmas movie in Italy
Just in case
It was given up because of lack of Uran, the negative response from the public and the Non-Proliferation Treaty
From what I've read they considered this option and thought it likely, some were even prepared to do it, if it would have been the only way out
That of course refers to smaller, tactical nukes
Yes, it is mandatory but only ~60% do the military service (20-25% are unfit and ~10% do a different service)
It's also true that you get to keep the rifle after the service
Many cantons offer a storage place though so you don't need to keep it at home (I guess the Russians aren't coming any time soon)
But you aren't in the reserve after the military service
You have to do a 3 weeks training every year and with ~35 you are finally let go
Then you can buy the rifle for a small price but only if you prove that you have used the rifle in the previous years in sport shooting
I think they mostly require this to reduce the private selling of military rifles
This
Also it was very expensive and the Armed Forces had a metric shitton of other projects which needed financing
I only ever met one guy from there
Might go see it next year
Otherwise, not much of an opinion right now

Is it common to read Bulgakov in school in Estonia
In Switzerland it isn't.
The inclusion of "ne" when (speaking) negative statements
Example: You're taught to say "Je ne sais pas" (I do not know)
French speakers will just say "Je sais pas".
I think we often use "u" or "ä"
For example: Valentina --> Valä, Melvin --> Melä, Nico --> Nicu, Michele --> Mischu, Manuel --> Manu/Mänu
Might not be like that everywhere but my friends use it like that
Depends on the dialect, you could either be a Dani or a Dänu (or something else), but I would say the - i ending is more common
The "u" thing is pretty much unique to Bern and Solothurn, I think
The most common thing is really to just shorten the name to it’s first syllable, like 'Val' for Valentin or 'Flo' for Florence
I would say that’s the norm, but adding extra sound at the end not so much indeed
Okay, good riddance
Fingers fucking crossed
What are regulators
If you want to live in a different country, you should adapt to - or at the very least accept that country's culture and values
If you want to cling to your own culture and values, you may do so as long as you don't violate any laws of your new home, but you have to accept being a social outsider because of it
If you want to impose your culture and values on the other citizens of your new chosen home - get the fuck out and go somewhere that shares your culture and values already
It should be that simple
Now it is possible that Macron is just a very skilled politician, but in the past few years, he has been one of my favorite/most respected world leaders, alongside Merkel
He appears to be very rational, though I can't speak much on followthrough as I don't live in France or follow french politics and local news
Xenophobia and racism are called out when terrible act like this are used to push an agenda against a whole ethnic gorup, religion or race
What happen is terrible and calling out religion extremism and terrorism it's right, as well as call for protecting free speech, but when the discussion morph into hate for one regligion in particular, then it should get called for what it is
Here you are making the mistake I was talking about before, you are talking about all Islam
While there is still very important group of fundamental Muslim, not denying that, there are also progressive Muslims that don't advocate for violence
Calling all Islam to "evolve" become an attack to a whole religion instead of the critique of a particular group that should be
Because even Christianity didn't "evolve" people inside it changed views and become more progressive
There are still a lot of fundamental Christian groups of various denomination and power
One thing you can do is showing them the progressive ones
How can they function in a more progressive society and integrate with the western values while keeping their own
Or you go kill them all, but I thought christians evolved from there, so that's probably not a solution
By doing the opposite of saying that integrating doesn't work, that we need more strict immigration laws and antagonize them
You show then people in the country that live peacefully while keeping their traditions, and mourn togheter with the christians
[Irrelevant xkcd]
ITT: Merkel is a:

There's also this often-posted picture:   which shows how much space car transportation takes, versus bus and bike
What's the average occupancy of a car at rush hour, versus the average occupancy of a bus at rush hour
The bus could definitely hold more people than that as well, this looks to be only the number of seats
Whereas anyone who regularly takes public transport will tell you that standing in the bus is super common
Reading that while being "annoyed" that the train that should leave at 12:49 just arrived at 12:51
It's still mostly run by private companies (the buses are, at least)
However, it's (1) much more tightly controlled by the government and (2) can be much more profitable at lower prices because there are so many more people in London
Americans be like ooh noo that's literally kommunism

I’m actually not opposed to cultural objects from one country being exposed in an exhibition in another country, because it contributes to educating people about foreign cultures, increasing multiculturalism etc
Years ago they brought some of the clay army soldiers from China to Munich for a special exhibition and it was an amazing opportunity
It just needs to be in accord with the other country
Simply demanding that your art be returned to you, because it’s "YOURS" is a remnant of 20th century nationalism and should have no place in the 21st century
he knew after the battle of Moscow that they could no longer win
His radical social darwinist ideology meant either Germany would win or should vanish
in 1941 Hitler said: "If once the German people are no longer strong enough and willing to sacrifice their blood for their existence, let them perish and be destroyed by another, stronger power
Here what Hitler said to Speer after issuing the Nero Decree: "If the war is lost, the people will be lost also
It is not necessary to worry about what the German people will need for elemental survival
On the contrary, it is best for us to destroy even these things
For the nation has proved to be the weaker, and the future belongs solely to the stronger eastern nations
In any case, only those who are inferior will remain after this struggle, for the good have already been killed
on another occasion he told an SS officier: "If the German people succumb, let them perish and make way for the biologically stronger
there is a very good book about the last year of the war in Germany by Ian Kershaw called The End, which explains the dynamics very well why the civilians didn't/couldn't revolt, why the military fought until the end and the suicidal mania of the Nazi Party trying to take Germany with it

I recently went on a small mountain trip with my dad to reconnect a bit after years of a shallow relationship
He told me he went to the same place with us when we were children to walk into the ice caves they made into the glaciers
That was maybe 25 years ago
Today you can see the glacier 100s of meters above in the mountain top
It's crazy to imagine all that ice came down that far

Ya only problem with this one is that you cant compare every theory with each other
Moon and Flat Earth are basic physics principles
9/11 is a huge geostrategic attack on the biggest empire of human history which lead to undemocratic changes of said empire therefore changing the future of humanity
This is the (official) part that we all agree on
Now it would be only fair to humanity and especially the american citizens to know what really happend on that day
And the official report says that a wealthy Saudi (who got into his cozy position because of the US) hired a bit more of a dozen other Saudis who highjacked 4 planes equipped only with cellphones and carpet knifes and hit 75% of their targets
The result of this is the Patriot Act, Iraq war II, Afghanistan (longest US war ever), torture in Guantanamo, NSA scandale and a whole lot of more PITA because of air travel controls/customs
Besides the obvious millions of innocent civil casualties
So the bottom line is that the world most defended fortress (Pentagon) got hit by some arabs without any real motive or resources

Absolutlemt correcte (excuse my shite french - even conductors have told me off, but the sentiment holds)
sad
I kind of agree, but note that plane tickets are _absurdly_ cheap
I was in Hamburg for a couple days this week-end
I went there by plane (Geneva-Hamburg), it was about $40
I came back by train (Hamburg-Basel), it was about $110
$110 for a train travel through all of Germany is pretty cheap in my opinion, even more so considering the good comfort in their ICE trains
Yet it's still nearly thrice what I paid for plane
And if you think about it: $40 for taking the plane
Seriously
It doesn't make sense how cheap this is
^(that being said, Swiss trains are expensive as hell in comparison to our neighbours
We could do some efforts there)
What’s the point of the picture
Everybody knows what a train is
Linking an article sourcing what the Netherlands did would be better>
Follow Luxembourg's path who just announced they will make all public transport free by 2020
I heard a guy once got a train on time in Netherlands
On the other hand, going all in high speed rail like France is not exactly a solution
Local train network are extremely effective at lowering the pressure on the road infrastructure, which has also a big ecological effect and more importantly big economical cost
With jetsmarter, a private jet flight from Geneva to London is barely more expensive than the train as well as infinitely better
Not talking about the prices of DB but about the prices of SBB
For comparison, a one-way ticket from Geneva to St
Gallen is CHF 108 (95€) for a much, much shorter distance than Hamburg-Basel
You can find them for half the price as supersavers/sparpreis, but that's it
I'm not saying that DB is too expensive
I'm saying that EasyJet is too cheap

Why the fuck is this pinned in r/EUROPE
America is a national security threat to Europe and a borderline enemy
Them going through their usual neocon/neoliberal cycle is not going to stop that
Every single problem the continent is facing is because of you
Mostly the middle eastern refugees that are now bringing cultural clashes to Europe, they are refugees to begin with because you destroyed their countries all in the name of jerking off your military industry
On top of that, the divisions in your country over your own cultural clashes are seeping into Europe in the form of populism
All those far right governments that seek to cut Europe into pieces
All those far left governments that tell us to turn a blind eye to terrorism
All born due to American actions and influences
We have none of the problems America has, and yet your cultural imperialism keeps turning people into idealists brainwashed by American matters
All these Europeans in twitter talking about the US elections, their protests, their candidates, what the hell is this
If their country is burning let it burn, the less power America has the more the EU will be able to have, and unlike America, the EU doesn't rely on warmongering to keep it's economy afloat
America is not us
You are not a friend or partner, you are an insidious and subversive agent that seeks to control everything and turn everything into you, and if it resists, you try to destroy it, and the last thing anyone in Europe wants is to be more like the US
The only thing you ever use your "partnership" for is to try to convince Europe of how totally great burning another middle eastern country is going to be, this time Iran, most likely
And by the way, "you are projecting" means nothing at this point

Right, better to let it fester underground
> You don't want to allow a platform for them to advertise their views,
I disagree
> nor an opportunity for the harassment of those they discriminate against (including hate speech)
Again, I disagree
> importance of social justice
And here I disagree the most
Social justice is anything but that, at least to most people who use the term
It's a type of disgusting, vile extremism that I tolerate just as little as the fucktards on the far right
I don't think that people flocking to extremism happens because extremism is allowed freedom to speak
It happens through high levels of dissatisfaction (and/or poor education)
So the way to combat extremism is not to muffle it, it's to create a social climate in which it cannot thrive
The issue with restricting freedoms is that it sounds good until the people you don't agree with are in charge
Furthermore, I don't believe that curtailing speech is in any way morally justifiable to increase "safety" or combat extreme views, because there's no evidence to suggest this
>  you do not want these people to grow their following, it is simplest to cut off their recruitment
Yes, but the way to do that is not to disallow speech, it's to create a population with no interest in extremism
> Regarding the second, I'm not entirely sure what you disagree with
Are you saying that this type of harassment should be tolerated
I'm saying that if you get harassed on an anonymous board then you can close your web browser (and how the hell to people even know what to harass you with
Or you can trust reddit's voting system, which curtails this shit even on loosely moderated boards
De-platforming doesn't work, it just pushes things underground
> (including hate speech)
See, here's the thing
Hate speech isn't "hateful speech" it's "speech that the current powers hate". It's not a precedent I want
See, you speak about appealing to emotion to goad people into joining the far right, mostly tapping into fear
I think this modern push by governments to curtail free speech is the exact same
They use a boogeyman (the far right) to try to get the average person to give up more of their rights to the government
Sue me, but I actually feel worse about the beating up than the Nazi salute
One is an arm gesture from a foreign drunk guy
The other is a responsible local who took it upon themself to act as the moral police, instead of letting the actual police handle it
When I was in Prague on a school trip we saw a shop with masks, including Hitler
Unfortunately, my friend put it on and did the Heil
Granted, it was super stupid (we were probably 15) and inappropriate, but certainly not worthy of a beating
Right, the guy was drunk and foreign
To be fair, Americans died as well because of Nazis
Germany doesn't own the sorrow
Chillax
I highly doubt that the person that beat them up had that background
I'm just saying that Americans have also suffered
It's not like he was specifically trying to offend those hurt by Nazis
Someone in his family may have died in the war
Because of my counterpoint to the argument that he came into a country that has a history he can't comprehend, as if Americans weren't in the mix

this is why I wanted Trump to win, another four years of him would have properly cut the ties between the US and Europe and Europe would have finally started to act more independently
So what
From a foreign policy POV it's much easier to deal with a stable China, which is also pretty transparent what it wants
With the US one might have Trump again in 4 years
Who is easier to plan with
Not really a hard question
The local region obviously is in favour of these bases
But the general population of Germany isn't really happy with them and were mostly happy with Trump's move
But of course Trump doesn't understands anything and thought that Germany would be devastated by his revenge
Oh for sure, you are totally right
I've done some research about the topic of authoritarian environmentalism at University, where the concepts you describe are also very prevalent
Congratulations, you just made a Hitler reference
And as I said below: And I wasn't making a normativ statement what are good and bad countries
I made the point that China is a more reliable/predictable partner than the US currently
Yeah, but since when does Capitalism care about that
There is a lot of countries the EU should not trade with
And I wasn't making a normativ statement what are good and bad countries
I made the point that China is a more reliable/predictable partner than the US currently
But at how many elections do you vote for a President that radically reverts current foreign policy
Fluctuation are expected, but Trump really treated his Allies quite badly
I dont think that has been the case with any US President before
And seeing how popular Trump still is, we might get him again in 4 years
An incredible database of knowledge for sure, and yet all these texts would probably fit in a 64Gb USB key

Sometimes I wonder if they actually would have made it into Switzerland
Mussolini was a registered criminal in Switzerland after all
Seems like the easy way out to be honest
People like this should be tortured for years
My grandpa was a kid during fascism and was actually quite fond of those times
Then the war and eventually the Germans came and he told me how they had nothing to eat and would "steal" potatoes from German soldiers, who were actually ok with it
He was just a boy at the time and had a lot of funny stories to tell
Probably he didn't want to tell me the less fun stories about those times
As I said, he was a registered criminal in Switzerland and was deported twice, once for advocation of violent strikes and the second time for falsifying his papers
These good cops types of posts seem really popular here

Agreed, it's a good role model tbh:

I used one of these at a 10K race where they had obviously forgotten to put the top half on, so it was basically 4 strangers facing each other while peeing in a big pot

Their plan isn't to make Islam look good, it's to terrorize the population for their extremist beliefs
Extremists aren't known for logical thinking
This is a little step towards a closer union
It sets a precedent for times of crisis and if everything works well it shows how the EU is vital to the European economy and stability
Let's hope for the best

Yeah, you shouldnt listen to those who throw around the term „fascist“ lightly and even less repeat what they say
I had / have a similar issue
It started around age 23 and, as I later found out, ties into issues that have been around since childhood
I find it hard to find enjoyment in this world and see it in a positive light
I find it hard to ignore what happens - even if I can only see a vague outline - and enjoy the small things everyone always talks about
There is so much negative
stuff around and I find it hard to tune out
A combination of career trouble, death of my best friend, and resulting alcoholism drove me to the brink of disaster
I very nearly gave up and I can't really claim to have "gotten myself" out of that all on my own
Because, in that particular moment, another "me" - forgotten and figuratively beaten out of me since childhood - re-emerged, along with memories of a painful childhood, memories which are still not fully part of "me"; I simply don't relate to them and can’t remember those days
That part of me views the world very differently
There's so much hatred and anger in that past that the present, no matter how bad it might be, barely registers as a drop in the ocean
And from that anger and bitterness stems energy and persistence I simply did not know I / this body / however one views this could have
That part of me showed me that one can actually enjoy the small things and find them to matter, if only briefly, before they vanish in a sea of doom and gloom
That the darkness can be as much a safe place to go unnoticed as it can be a thing to fear and avoid
I just do not know how to see or do that myself
I find it hard to let to, hard to accept that life is painful, unfair, and maybe going nowhere
But there's a part of me which can, so I clearly must be able to too
Somehow
The hardest part, for me at least, is that accepting life also means accepting my memory of the past is flawed – and that many of my issues are deeply personal
That I actually do have memories of extremely painful years which I've repressed, that what I assume I value I might not actually hold dear, that there is anger and resentment buried deep in me, and that there's a whole different version of me, a me which I am more than a little bit afraid of because of that past – a me which is many things I’m not: social, outgoing, opinionated, rash, and at times brutally direct and unafraid
If I could accept that part of myself, I theorize, I could maybe come to see the value in life too - but I'm not sure how
It involves utterly re-evaluing my sense of individuality, of who I am, and everything I have in the past held to be true
It means giving up what I believe I value and cling to as a framework of myself, to replace those notions with what I do actually value emotionally
It means facing the fact I might be a bad person, might think and believe things I find impractical or - worse - flat out morally or ethically wrong
Most of all it means accepting that who I am underneath my rationale and who I think I am / want to be does not really align
To me, it means most of all, accepting I am not in control and have to let go of my existence
Something I find extremely hard to do since “letting go” usually makes things worse and has in the past been my worst fear (if I let go, I will fail – that’s what was hammered into me, even though rationally I know that’s not at all true)
Now, I'm pretty sure not everyone with such issues is in quite the same position I'm in, because most people don't have an entirely different repressed self lingering in their minds at all times
But I think the underlying mechanics are present in many people coming of age in this world
What one was raised with, what one was taught, and reality end up being two very different beasts and I think that happens with every generation
It's left to us to determine how to fit the pieces together, while at the same time trying to make an existence in a world which seems hell bent on removing the ability or hope of doing that
Time and again, I hear the same question muttered, out of earshot of people who might provide simple answers and quick fixes that everyone knows don't work: "what's the point to it all" and “why are we even trying”?
Many people give quick, simple answers that amount to busywork – things to distract the mind with to avoid the harder questions, or fill whatever dissatisfaction is left with some sort of meaning
I do that too to distract myself – it’s a bandaid at most and one that constantly peels off
In all honestly, I don’t really have an answer and am more and more beginning to realize I don’t want one
There’s a part of me which can deal with this, a part which can be profoundly wise and insightful, and insanely dumb and narrow-minded, in the same breath
So my ultimate goal is to become more like that, more able to let go, and hope that somehow improves my perception and quality of life
Though the gulf might be too wide to ever mend completely
I have a sense that, with age, the best I’ll manage is a mostly-healed mental scar, but never a complete “me” again
The two halves have diverged too much over the years
In the interim, I’m dealing with my own problems poorly enough and can, at best, ignore the larger ones in the world and hope they don’t affect me
But I think the deeper truth is that, in order to grow and fill those dark spaces, one does somehow have to let go and let life be as it is
That sounds profound but I’ve no idea how the hell to do that
I find most of my value systems, my ways of evaluating life, are bound into a rational framework I was taught but which is proving… well, not entirely useful in practice
While on the other hand my emotions are a chaotic mess I try to keep at bay, in part out of fear of negative impact, and in part as I do not feel ready or stable to approach them
I’m not sure where I’m going with all this
But what you wrote struck me relatable – by own issues, which revealed a bit soup of deeper problems, started around the same age
Wish I could say it gets better but I can barely say it gets a bit easier without sounding hollow and pretentious

Aside from that, don't ask me
We [have one] in Switzerland too, it was once used for the Gotthard-Route (which ironically contains the word God) between Italy and Switzerland
The new one shows that it's quite an important route
The myth behind it: They had to build a bridge there, but no human could
So they made a contract with the devil: He builds the bridge and the first living being that crosses it becomes his
After he had completed it, they took a goat - which would charge at anything with horns - and showed it the devil
The devil was quite pissed of course and did something to get his revenge, but I sadly can't remember that part
>The new one shows that it's quite an important route
What backs your statement further is that the bridges on your picture are both "new ones", the newest one opened in 1958 and is the third Devil's Bridge, the older one opened in 1830 and is the second Devil's Bridge
The first Devil's Bridge there was built around 1595 but after the second one was opened it wasn't really used anymore so they stopped maintaining it due to which it collapsed in 1888
Before the first Devil's Bridge there used to be Wooden Bridges in that place at least since the thirteenth century
The new buildings by the water designed to look like old buildings are so cool

I live in Switzerland next to the border to Italy and it's like this but 10x more extreme
Our roads are great ya
Small exception for like small mountain villages, which might have slightly imperfect roads
My thoughts when I saw this post: Is this some sort of peasant joke I'm too Swiss to understand
Look by yourself by using google street view in Ponte Chiasso
Not sure
Most countries in Europe get to freezing temperatures
I think we just fix things quickly and build roads well
I’ve been to France literally 5min from my house in Switzerland, and some of the roads are patchworks of holes that have been filled in a different color and stuff

Switzerland is about to legalise gay marriage
The parliament already approved gay marriage and the SVP and EDU took a referendum against it, however they're currently struggling to get enough signature, if they fail to get the signatures, gay marriage will be legal by April

In Switzerland there's some differences afaik, but I don't remember them from the top of my head
Let's not ridicule people for believing in religion please
It only creates more hate in the world for no good reason
Yes
We had to convince the majority of men in Switzerland to let women vote
Which is pretty much unique in the world, iirc
Direct democracy as we have is quite good, honestly, but there is indeed the problem of when the population isn't quite on board which things which should be basic rights
Switzerland doesn't really have ruling parties
There's neither a coalition nor an opposition like there is in other countries
And that's how you'll never convince them to change their views

The Dutch are better than this
Small countries can have bigger swings
They closed their nuclear power plant in 2009 from the USSR
Netherlands promotes electric cars because Tesla is in Tilburg
Switzerland has a hydro infrastructure and old nuclear plants as a baseline, no coal and green energy climbing in production
The pumping into reservoirs is slowly being developed too, but it’s not generalized yet
We bought a lot in recent years because our old nuclear power plants had to shut down for maintenance
My point was mostly that Lithuania drop in nuclear production was not due to them switching gear completely, they simply (had to) close their only plant, which shifted the dynamics completely

I don't know what the definition of an "American Pizza" is so I can't comment
Interesting because I would have assumed what they eat on shows like friends or seinfeld would be NY Style pizza, seeing as they live in NY, and the kind of pizza they eat on TV looks like a tiny bit of sauce and a tiny bit of cheese spread thinly on 2mm of limp pizza dough
Meanwhile what is sold as American Style pizza in Switzerland is just regular pizza except with comically thick bread, like 2cm

Everything is expensive here
Want a McDonalds hamburger
Pay $2
I think it's around $1
05 (1 euro) in italy right
Yeah Germany and Switzerland are both doing pretty well
The only difference is the everything is just more expensive in Switzerland
Yeah, being Swiss is only really profitable when you are on vacation
Can confirm
I pay 440$ per month in healthcare
Switzerland has four official languages: German, French, Italian and Romansh
I think latin was a way of avoiding the tension between the four groups =)
I mean the smallest (plain old hamburger)
Buns, ketchup, onions and a piece of meat (I think)
Swiss taxes are pretty low, but that's because Switzerland loves businesses
High taxes would force them out and that would be a big loss
The real reason is most likely the banking system during the second world war
We profited from the allies and axis
And from this the economy was incredible stable (no war)
Thus the Swiss franc was seen as a stable currency and it did stayed stable up to now
Right now it's even too strong which forced our central banks to start putting a -% on bank accounts of more than CHF 1M to avoid rich people storing their swiss francs in swiss bank accounts
Taxes are actually lower
The problem is that wages are higher overall
Since the wages are higher, the prices are higher and everything else gets more expensive
What made the whole thing more expensive overall
I don't know
Most likely the strong CHF which barely changed
People invest in CHF to keep their money from devaluing thus the CHF stayed strong in the past few decades
Swiss banks hate it though
That's why we have a -1% tax on bank accounts with more than 1 million CHF to make rich people stop storing their money in switzerland
talkig about this one:
No official minimum wage in switzerland
I'm pretty sure there is no laws at all
There are a few laws for hourly work but for full time jobs there aren't any
Reality itself is being questioned

We did talk about it
It was the second topic of the day after the other protest
Why that stupid title
This problem is a discussion we often have in Switzerland
In Switzerland there are referendums all the time
There was an peoples initiative from a far right party in 2014
It said there should be a limited amount of imigrants we accept and EU-Citicens would not be able to live as easy in switzerland anymore
The swiss people voted yes
Many citicens weren't happy with the result and wanted a second vote "because they didn't know the consequences". This would have been very inconsequental and treason to everyone who wanted to vote yes
We don't do a second vote in switzerland because some "didn't like the result".
Thankfully the initiative was changed by the parliament which made it essentially useless (which is anti-democratic btw
I don't think there should be a second Brexit-refenrendum in Great Britan
It would be treason to the right and they would get angry and rise up to fight the goverment and bring chaos the country (even more than now)
It would hurt the democracy
Every time someone would be unhappy some people would want to do all again and everything would get inefficient and everyone would get more unhappy

Same, nothing better than a good beer in København
In Switzerland, yes
Lauterbrunnen, no
Too far away from everything (like work)
> they enjoy how flat it is here
It gives a feeling of space
When it's super flat you can see so far away, it looks so big
It's amazing when you come from a place where  you just can't see the horizon because there are always nearby mountains
well they probably go straight for amsterdam:p jokes aside, not everyone here grows up in the mountains
we have plenty of flat, boring areas
me personally, id really miss the mountains if id move away
Don't think you're telling me anything new
Tourism would be massively improved by the removal of tourism
The fact remains that the hordes of (Chinese) tourists are massively detrimental to the enjoyment of these places
We don't even have sea
Seeing the open ocean is quite something
i love that comment from the other thread lol
such different views of topography
there is an area close to where i work where its all hills and i hate it because to me these aren't mountains

I terribly feel what happened to Greece
I was studying political economics while it happened and I was fulminating about the troikas moves and the cynicism of the Germans
If the monetary union would be more complete and honest, richer and more productive states should pay for others, just like between the Swiss cantons
Greece has been disgustingly played and the consequences of that is far from over
Germans are convinced it's because they have so much privacy
Exactly
All that plus when you do something simple in Germany, like get internet from some shitty company, they take a copy of your passport
Germans give out their personal info like like it's candy
The government puts so much effort into monitoring their lives
The banks share your info with foreign governments
But when a foreign company shows up to do business, ma privaccyy

"made in America" is a warning label
Because slaughterhouses in america are less sanitary when it comes to separating the guts and their bacteria filled contents from the meat without any spillage
So they have dirty meat and just spray it down at the end, much cheaper that way
Meanwhile in europe the steps are more careful (so they take more time) but on the flip side no disinfectant is needed at the end
Keep in mind this info comes from me reading through a lot of comments on this post
Also apparently america is slowly changing from chlorine to some other disinfectant, not sure how much "healthier" that one is, tho

As a Swiss guy who went to an international school and most of my friends aren’t originally Swiss
The ones who became Swiss (most of them since it’s very welcoming here) only use their Swiss passport when they travel now
That’s Spanish, Japanese, British, American, etc friends
All of them for the same reason
Perception
Apart from /r/Europe most of the world likes Switzerland and Swiss people and it’s very unlikely to offend anyone
In fact you get a lot of taxi drivers, hotel receptionists, other tourists, bar owners, etc say great things about Switzerland when you tell them where you’re from
That's what I pointed out but people are some what shut off from reality
This ranking takes into account covid border closures
Like Germans can enter Denmark but Fins can't. In a normal case this isnt the case
The Henley ranking is the true ranking
Very certain
According to those rankings (on the website) New Zealand were the top last year
This is the true ranking:
The measurement methods is visa free access like today
So with a german passport you can enter 135 countries if you travelled today
Without a pandemic, the henley global ranking applies and  will update to measure it
As I said based on this New Zealand was the top passport last year
>The travel restrictions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic have caused a shake-up in visa-free travel
New Zealand is now at the top of the passport index with visa-free access or visa on entry to 128 countries
Japan is in second place with a score of 128, alongside Germany, Austria, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Ireland, South Korea and Australia
Sweden, Belgium, France, Finland, Italy and Spain come in third place with a score of 127
[Source]
Also there is no different measurement methods
It's literally visa free access or not
During covid obviously it differs as countries close borders to each other (ie EU to almost the rest of the world) which is not the case in a non-pandemic environment
What
And not pay for it too
Cool so much new land

And they can still do it if they reimburse the aid beforehand
>    The Government and all parties to the Parliament agree that the extended and extended fixed cost scheme introduces a condition in the Compensation Orders that applicants, as a condition of receiving compensation for the extended period, must declare by faith and laws, that the companies will not pay dividends or buy back shares for the financial years 2020 and 2021
The condition will apply to companies that receive more than DKK 60 million
in compensation in 2020 in the compensation scheme for fixed costs
Companies will later be able to free themselves from these restrictions by reimbursing paid aid under this scheme in excess of DKK 60 million

Wait he forgot the lobbyists
Would be twice the number of bureaucrats
Ah yes
Good ol propaganda
No it doesn't. This is exactly what tried to do with the EU
Reduce the official employee count and costs at a maximum and rely on the "civil society" to provide documentation on whatever matter
This is exactly what negates any political power and debate in the European arena
That's precisely why the EU is seen as a bunch of technical norms and arbitrations
No political group has any ambition or political project other than those arbitrations and norms because they have no decent workforce compared to national Parliaments and are working under pressure and to late on any issues
I don't think that the EU countries are more different than the States of America were before WWI
Another example comes to my mind
At a different scale, Switzerland is, and still is, a multi-cultural, multi-religion country
In 1868 the country was made of very different pieces, with strongly opposed political, religious and cultural views with huge gaps in the wealth distribution
Over time, it got more integrated and we did not wait for it to create an army, we made it at the beginning
Also, we got seriously beaten by Napoleon with our 20 little armies :D that motivated us for one common army
USA NUMBAH WANNNN
Peaceful European unification
by force
It really depends on what you take for values
Yes, the US has impressive GDP
But socially, it's as developed as a 3rd nation with healthcare / education quality and costs as one example, aswell as not really great worker's rights
It's often said that you can have a better life in the USA than in Europe, if you're rich that is
wait waht
The Hungarian “illiberal democracy” model is everything Trump and alike are aspiring to
To me, the most interesting part is that the election system was based on the German model
They managed to slowly disintegrate the political system over the years resulting in the current authoritarian government by fully controlling the media, replacing judges as well as limiting their rights
What a chad

/r/redditmoment
Could you be more specific of this
What would happen if somebody said (**I AM NOT SAYING I ACTUALLY BELIEVE THIS PLS NO BAN**) it was a response to another event
Is that trying to justify genocide or trying to explain why it was done
I ask because "genocide denial" is a term thrown around too much, for example whenever a Turk talks about the Armenian things without being 100% apologetic (when he personally did nothing) everybody says he's denying it
Probably if the Swiss invaded them again
Some respond to the murder of one of their countrymen by holding a silent march with white roses to symbolize grief and memorial photographs of past victims
Others ignore the murder and protest those who have a problem with it by holding a concert
There's fascism
These people are against that
> It's not like everyone protesting is a nazi
Maybe not, but they are way to comfortable to walk with Nazis and don't distance them self from them nor the resulting violence
Frankly that sort of behavior is just as bad as actually being a Nazi
Do you seriously think that's even remotely the right way to "raise valid concerns"? I don't know about you, but I certainly was raised better
You can bet that if some assholes tries to "argue" with me in that way that I would have walked away long time ago
I'm actually impressed by the women for trying that long to have a discussion while 3-4 people are screaming at her at the same time
They show zero respect and zero interest in having an actual discussion
The later would require them to actually let the women get a word in
> So by your logic people are either forced to accept that a known criminal wasnt deported despite significant evidence of his crimes and this is perfectly fine, or they are nazis
Nope, they could have gone home and organise another demonstration
And if Nazis show up, the organiser could actually ask the security personal to remove them
Tadaa
I've solved the walking with Nazi Dilemma for you
IT'S NOT THAT HARD TO NOT WALK WITH NAZIS
But you would actually have to care about it
> They're clearly pissed off by her apathy
So fucking what
That's no way to have a discussion and they should be ashamed of them self for acting that way
But again, those asshole clearly show that they don't WANT to have a discussion
What they wanted was their very own "two minutes of hate".
And in what way does all of this make their actions even one bit right
How can you actually come here and make excuses for that kind of behavior
And that's even if all their fear would be justified, which by actual statistics they aren't. For starters Saxony has one of the lowest rates of foreigners and actual crimes are on a steady decline (down 9% in 2017 for example)
But that's beside the point
Even if all their fears would be completely justified that would still be a fucking disgraceful act of those "adults".

Azerbaijan and other Caucasus have disputed status because of such proximity to the Caucasus mountain range seperating Asia and Europe with their culture, but Turkey is a different story except for Istanbul, which is obvious

The main problem I see with a ban is that the operation would then be performed illegally, back alley style, much to the detriment of the little "patients". I see much more pronounced mutilation, up to many deaths as a result of a ban
Maybe in time things would improve, but in the short term, many babies would suffer worse fates than missing foreskin
(I'm all for this practice ending swiftly, but it probably has to happen through education
Good luck
Is this only major lines
The map seems to exclude most of the Rhaetian Rail, granted it is narrow gauge, but still
well the swiss railway is displayed much smaller than it actually is
Shouldn't Switzerland be more dense, I mean we literally got the world's most dense railway network
Switzerland also has way more lines
This is a very inaccurate map
Same for switzerland
There's even a UNESCO world heritage line missing on this map
Not complete at all, the Swiss train network is waaay bigger than displayed here
Use [openrailwaymap

I'm sorry but I completely disagree with you
We don't need to honour people like King Leopold with statues of him in public commemorating him
This pic will forever haunt me (extremely NSFL):
You're barking up the tree for the wrong person
They should instead put up a monument or statue for his victims like Germany did for the Jews, literally right next to where Hitler died, while the spot he was burnt is just a carpark
They can put his statue in a museum or whatever, again with the focus on his victims rather than that bastard
Historically people can be morally ambiguous, true
But in cases like this for this monster, there should be no argument at all

>And what am i supposed to do
Travel to Ireland and threaten to punch everybody in the face if they dont stop being a tax haven
Ireland only works as a tax haven because of how the EU is setup
That's something that can be changed without punching any Irish
The EU was setup to allow free inter-country trade
It allows a company in Ireland to sell in Germany without actually having a presence there, because small outfits can't realistically open an office in every EU country
The unintended side effect is non-European companies (and maybe more mercenary European ones) chose Ireland as their EU HQ, because it doesn't matter to them where they are and corporate tax is low
So the loophole is massive companies act like Irish-only companies
Prevent that
One option is to rethink EU law, forcing companies with a significant presence in Germany (for example) to pay standard corporate tax on Germany based subsidiaries
In effect, companies with > XXmillion revenue have to open a proper German branch to do business, reporting profit/loss at a local level, and excluding licenses from expenses
Another option is to try to tax economic activity locally, e.g. just straight up tax revenues collected in a country irrespective if they're profits or not
The nice benefit to these is they actually solve the apparent issue, which is German revenue should result in Germany taxation
Otherwise, why care
Taxes are not paid as punishment, they are paid to fund something
If the Irish don't want high corporate taxes, so be it
Why does a German care that a corporation in Ireland pays low taxes
How would higher Irish taxes help Germany

Love seeing foreign Europeans comment on the language region situation of Switzerland or question whether the language regions are closer to their neighboring country
I think some people think we're not united or something
Being a multilingual collection of cantons is literally the fabric of the country
You see the flags of every canton being flown in every other canton
It'd be difficult to go a day without seeing all of the country's languages in some way
We are born and raised in a multilingual Swiss culture
It's not weird or divisive
I am at home whether in Geneva, Lugano, or Zurich
We have the same shops, the same sports teams, the same education, the same languages, etc
Just an example
I go to University in the French-speaking part of Switzerland
I go to lectures with people from every region of Switzerland and people from across the world
The Swiss hang out together regardless of languages
We have the same culture and are all in our country
Don't project division onto us, it's pretty annoying
Examples of unity and how diversity is literally the whole point of Switzerland and it's embraced
> you'll be literally frowned upon if you dispose glass outside these hours
in Switzerland people would call the police
Small addition: while we are indeed politically irrelevant, we have some diplomatic relevancy as we act as liaison between [Iran and the US] have a role in the [Korean conflict] and other such small diplomatic missions, as well as Geneva being in general an international hub for organisations
So it's not exactly correct to say we are completely disinterested in the world stage, we just leverage our neutrality to hopefully do some good
It's not that nice
But hopefully the girl is nice

I like how Switzerlands oldest business is a restaurant called Sternen
It's one of the most used restaurant names in Switzerland, clocking in at about 230, according to an [article in the NZZ] from 2013
The oldest Swiss company is older than Switzerland
The old Swiss confederacy was established in 1291
as a swiss I have to say this is really low effort
Restaurant zum Sternen (Tavern to the stars)
well thanks but which one
there is one in every village and it not a franchise so it could be any of about 2000
Switzerland: There is almost in every village a restaurant ("Gasthof") called Sternen
I'm still somewhat confused about Switzerland

No, Switzerland should be solid gold

I can't name a single Belgian chocolate brand, meanwhile the likes of Lindt, Toblerone, the whole Nestle lot, etc are world known, and those are just the industrial mass-produced ones
They make good chocolate no doubt
It annoys me more when people say that the British make the best chocolate and that Cadberry is the best brand
Ya it's the best if you like the taste of ass in your mouth
If I wanted the fakest, most sugary, most caramelized chocolate in the world, then yes I'd love Cadberry
Swiss here
This is spot on
Well, it is actually technically correct as not all of it was returned
For me the real trigger is "Switzerland got rich because of Jewish gold".
My reaction for the chocolate for me is more like : "Is it
Never tried it
For the gold it would be more like : "Oh my god are we gonna have to talk about that AGAIN
" So yeah, more irritated
I disagree
The chocolate thing triggers me much more
Also it's not true, tbh

Oh wait
IT'S *FRENCH*!!!
Yes, one of the conditions for the access to the global market the US enforced after WWII was that Switzerland pay billion worth of fines for all the trade the confederation had with the Nazi regime
So we gave back the Jews' gold
^(Not sure we gave it back *to* the Jews, though

That's because in the international system, countries owe money to other countries
In other words, money goes from one central bank to another central bank
Because there is not central bank for the victims of the Holocaust, unless individuals demand reparations (usually though a trial), no one is going to give them a penny

Also, we start learning English later in school because we always start out with another main language (French, Italian or German, depending on where you're from)

Ah those fuckers
Those fucking pigeons
Rant time
I live in a shitty flat
Building older than most countries on Earth, 1 room + 1 kitchen marketed as "2 rooms with fitted kitchen" (but actually not equipped), door so well insulated that I hear my neighbours in their own flat, no laundry room, rent $1240 monthly
The view is on a small humid courtyard where the Sun doesn't reach the bottom
And it's that courtyard that pigeons elected to be their home
At any time of the day, there are between 10 and 20 pigeons in there
By the windows, on the walls, on the outside window covering, everywhere
And they just stay there doing nothing all day other than noisily saying "rou". All day
Non stop
A frequency of one "rou" per second, for _hours_. You can't open your windows without hearing these fuckers going "rou", aggressively so because they're so damn loud
They make more noise than the neighbouring tram line FFS
And they looove my windows
Seriously, my kitchen windows are covered in pigeon grease because they come and snuggle against it
If I clean my windows, it may last only two days before they're covered in grease again (no exaggeration, two days)
On my room windows, there are two rails of anti-pigeon spikes
But guess what
They don't give a damn
They come anyways
I keep my window blinds (whatever they're called) shut because otherwise they do come
Last night I forgot to close the blinds and I couldn't sleep before 3 AM
Figured out I could sleep this morning
Guess what motherfucker, the pigeons had another plan
Woke me up at 7 by the loud noise of them snuggling against my window, pushing the spikes away
Four of them
Making enough noise to wake me up through a window that insulates ambulance noises

“Structural Funding to areas in decline” is the opposite of what a good investor does, namely investing the funds where they create the most value
> and world
Yeah, ain't no EU country ever dropping bombs on another country in the last 70 years
Surely there would never be an EU country allowing halal practices
A good investor is one who creates actual value (as opposed to taking it away from others in a zero-sum game), thereby making the pie bigger such that everyone benefits in the end
Investing is about finding the optimal allocation of capital
It is in everyone’s interest that resources are not wasted
So you're saying that halal slaughter is allowed in some EU countries and in other countries it's forbidden
I wonder why some countries in the EU forbid halal slaughter
Seems to me that it's discrimination on religious ground if it's only prayer and ritualistic turning, and no difference in cruelty for the animal
News for you: it is possible to create value without destroying something else
So, there's discrimination in the EU
Grow a carrot in your garden
Seems to me
Since halal slaughter is cruel, and halal slaughter is allowed in some EU countries and others not, then it suggests that some countries are discriminating a perfectly cruelty free slaughter method based on religious grounds
Or termed differently:
If there is cruelty free halal slaughter and the EU allows cruelty free slaughter in general, then every EU country should allow halal slaughter
Why are there still countries which do not allow halal slaughter
You wanted an example of creating value
But also financial investments can create value, for example if you enable someone to become a successful potato farmer
So I'll try to summarize to see if I understand you correctly
If we take into account orthodox groups, then every EU country is discriminating on religious grounds
If we don't consider orthodox groups but only "moderates" (whatever that means), then it's not clear yet what constitutes cruelty and what not, and as soon as that is a given by the EU, then there are countries which discriminate on religious ground
Maybe the countries who currently allow halal will be the ones discriminating
Maybe the countries who currently forbid halal will be the ones discriminating
In any case, the EU does not regulate anything regarding halal, the one way or another and it's something that's currently up to the countries

When I was in Sweden some Augusts ago, we had night temps of about 15 °C and every single restaurant had gas powered heat mushrooms out, one per table
I was sweating my balls off in a T-shirt while all the natives around us were wearing jackets
My world view shattered that night
That's weird
But I was there in August, not winter
I'm thinking of going to Greece soon
Never been
Seems like a good time to visit
Empty, and the local economy must be desperate for tourists
Greece is so beautiful, I'm in awe each time I go there
Luckily it's also super cheap (for us at least)
Can't wait to go back next year

>  Politicans are people too, they can have their opinions
Here's the thing, to me this issue is something that you can't brush aside as "oh it's just their opinion". It's morally wrong to deny this right to people
It's not that far off (to me) from if, say, Merkel voted in favor of racial segregation and you'd just brush it off as "oh well, she's not getting in the way of the yes voters, she can have her opinion".
Denying people an equal right because of your religious beliefs
Just bad morality
I mean marriage itself is just a stupid religious thing
Denying it isn't really amoral
Denying them equal rights is however bad

That route is not particularly difficult since you only have three major climbs and none of these are beyond 1'500m(The one from Broc into Simmental, Brünig and Sattel)
The route from Montreux to Rorschach is circa 440km and climbs a total of 3'400m. A well seasoned randonneur could do this in two days, no problem
If you're resonably fit and keen but want to soak in the scenery 3-4 days might be appropriate, if bicycle touring is new to you might want to plan with a week or even more
Keep in mind that while the height of the passes doesn't encompass high alpine regions the difference in altitude is not to be underestimated when it comes to climate
Weather changes in the alps can be swift and drastic, especially during the height of summer
Pack some rain gear and something warm
When it comes to prices it's hard to guess, if you like wild camping and are mostly self sustained when it comes to cooking you can travel with less than $5 a day, if you have 3 meals in restaurants and stay in hotels every day you can easily surpass $100
If you're a bit on a budget and stay in youth hostels and don't eat too fancy $40-50 a day is probably a good guess
Not being counted as a big neighbor of Switzerland that is

Oh wait this map makes them look bad
I see
The value fluctuates based on your economy, not German economy
Things are going bad, currency depreciates, easier to export stuff cause it's cheap for others, tourists show up
Things are going good, currency appreciates, buy a bunch of stuff from others, pay off loans
Or you can just change the value to control things like inflation
Print money, issue bonds, do whatever the fuck you want
When Greece hit rough waters, there was nothing to do, and nothing happened naturally for economy to correct itself

the only good-looking part of the city
The greatest thing about Bern is the view from the Kornhausbrücke I get every morning on my way to work
Can confirm
We are a postcard city
Between r/travel r/pics and r/europe, I see this exact image every month
Same goes for that matterhorn lake picture and Grindelwald-Interlaken
Well it's the oldtown, is that relation anything special for any european city
Geneva looks pretty good outside of old town, around the lake
same with Zurich
Bern is mostly ugly industrial-looking buildings outside of old town
That’s probably because you have never been here and your only impression of Bern is the train ride through Bümpliz and Bethlehem (quite ugly)
Bern Lorraine, Breitenrain, Wabern, Kirchenfeld, Weissenbühl and Länggass are all very nice, filled with 1900s buildings, cozy places, lots of trees and large roads
In Zurich and Geneva, everything is dense, the rest of the city is comprised of average 50s to 70s building blocks
I have, in fact, been to Bern
I speak from experience, not a train ride
It's beautiful
It speaks to my soul
I must have it
that's a glitch, just reload the map

November 2007 and they're asking this BS
At that time, we'd had touchscreen controlled smartphones with user installed apps and a wide range of connectivity (3G, BT, Wifi) for more than two years, rapidly gaining popularity
Even the original iPhone had been out for almost a year
Nokia had nothing to compete with these new devices, and everybody who had even a slight interest in mobile devices knew that they needed to come up with something quickly if they wanted to stay relevant
Edit: ok, so the iPhone hadn't been out for a year yet
More like four months
But the iPhone in my argument wasn't exactly an example of how far smartphones already were back then
Argument still stands
I had a two year old HTC Universal back then, that blew anything Apple or Nokia had at the time clean out of the water
Apps
yup
3G? yup
Full VGA touchscreen
yup
yup

Last time we had such an exceptional heat in Switzerland a lot of people died
Take great care of elderly people and young children
Make them drink water until it drips out from the ears
Alcohol, sodas, sugared drinks DO NOT hydrate they need water to be processed
Isotonic drinks are good
Open the windows at night if temperatures drop, humidify the curtains [at that moment]
Keep windows, curtains and blinds CLOSED ALL DAY, (closed as in completely closed)
[Occasionally] hang humid cloth in front of the fans
Don't eat to much or too rich, especially elders and young children
If you wet the curtains only at night when the windows are open and air is circulating it helps and it won't turn your house in a sauna
Similarly, at night and if you live on the first 2 floors, if you through buckets of water on the street under your widows you will have fresh air entering the house
I don't care about the physics of it
It works, old people in the south of France who used it for decades showed it to me
If you put cold water on a cloth an a fan in front of you it will cool you down, just like the water on your skin, the water on the cloth evaporates capturing heat and letting fresher air come to your face
If you do it too much or on tens of fans (who knows
) you might indeed, have too much humidity in your house at some point
Keeping the windows and blinds closed during the day, leaving the heat outside, seems having a better summer 101 to me
unless you have a cardboard house that has no temperature inertia
Yes it would if you do it too much
If the air becomes too saturated in vapor it makes the perceived temperature be much higher
Of course
But, by experience, it is impossible to make old folks and children drink so much that it becomes dangerous
Children are stubborn and generally don't like water as they are given way to much sodas
Elderly are generally already dehydrated because they don't feel thirst as much as other people anymore
Too much water would be the least of my concerns in a heat wave honestly
But, yes, unlimited Isotonic beverages would be the best
I won't. Humidifying the curtains AT NIGHT WITH WINDOWS OPEN helps
It has helped me in Santiago, Chile hot summer
A few humid cloth in front of fans is NOT going to turn your house in a sauna
Yeah I can imagine
A friend lives under the roof of an old building and for sure he has to let air circulate
But in general, whether you live in a modern insulated house or an old heavy walled construction like stone, you're better off opening at nights only
It was in the sequel, Twenty Years After, the names of the castles are never mentioned in The Three Musketeers

Our company was not GDPR compliant at all, not because we sold the data, but because our software and processes weren't up to par
It was stored securely, however some of our employees had access to production databases for troubleshooting purposes and we couldn't say for sure that we would find them all to delete
I think both the anonynisation and the complete deletion of data are aspects of the GDPR
Our main issue was that the system was highly customizable to the point where you had to have the actual prod database to reproduce bugs
Sometimes, even the original, identifying values were relevant
For us to be GDPR compliant, we had to create an anonymisation script for the databases that were accessed by more people and a "quarantine environment" for the databases with original values where only a select few had access
Even finding the sensitive data was challenge, because it's an old system
Creating that script and not corrupting _some_ data took a decent amount of time
Add to that, you can't just drop everything to become GDPR compliant, other issues are time sensitive as well
That means, it takes quite a bit of time
Some systems might just be incompatible with the GDPR if they made some really bad design choices
And I mean _really_ bad ones
Yes, like the US states
Californians always say that, but even though it gets points for being different and unique, I always found the design quite lackluster
Yes, it's not as boring as the Italian tricolor, but that doesn't make it good in any other way

I'm so happy for the UK, greetings from Switzerland
While I don't particularly care about Brexit, I do believe that remaining in the EU would have been the better choice for them
Now that the vote's passed though, everyone (including the EU itself) must/should adhere to the will of the people and start the process
This is where I start seeing problems
Up until now, the EU was this grand undertaking that attempted to unite Europe under one banner, thereby increasing the political and economic power of the continent (whether they actually succeeded is another matter entirely)
However, Brexit now shows that the EU is not set in stone; that there is an alternative
Through this, the EU loses both prestige and power, and the power dynamics within it change
Germany and France have been the biggest controlling powers, and opposition, if any, was often led by the UK as one of the few countries able to oppose this coalition within the EU's parliament
With the UK gone, that's essentially free reign for those two
Now, Brexit has shown other countries that leaving a union you're not content with is an option
Marine Le Pen, one of France's contenders for the next election of the head of state, has already promised a "Frexit" referendum should she be elected
Similar calls have made themselves be heard in the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy and Austria
Brexit is not an incident that can be looked at in isolation; it destabilises the entire EU, which had already taken major hits to its credibility after the Italy/Spain/Greece debt disaster and the surge of immigrants, thereby threatening the economic and political future of many more countries
tl;dr: I'm not even living in the EU
But as a European, the threat of destabilisation Brexit poses worries me
Welcome to the land of side deal and compromises
While it's nice to be out, the deals you have to make can hurt
Unfortunately for some reasons I think the EU will have a grudge with you guys and the deals won't be very good or your side
Oh, I 100% agree
Also the EU has the upper hands anyway in the negotiations since the UK will need those bilateral deals more than the EU does
I hope that this will not affect us negatively, we always had to pay more for our agreements with the EU than if we were in it, but they were still worth it
With the UK leaving and EU having to be more strict and punishing to the UK I'm afraid that deals with other non-eu countries will risk to worsen too

"Facilitating peace" isnt a neccessarily good thing, it always depends on the context
Theres a very clear ideological stance from the church regarding uprisings, which is almost always on the conservative side and maintenance of status quo, from which they benefit

Wait
Germany is extraditing it‘s own citizens
I mean you‘d expect a country not to extradite their own citizens in any case, or is that just in Switzerland the case,
Isn’t there a radio tower we could go "visit" somewhere
Ah ok
Still kinda strange to me, but that makes it more understandable
In Switzerland you won‘t get extradited, but you‘ll be tried here for the crimes committed abroad and the lower punishment will be implemented
Not extraditing does not mean law stop at the border, it just means you won‘t hand citizens over to other countries against their will
You can still try them in your own country
But then wouldn‘t it be better to try them in your own country
At least that‘s the case in Switzerland
If you can‘t be extradited you‘ll be tried in Switzerland or you‘ll just serve the sentence here

Also, I know a lot of people seem to think that Socrates was potentially not a real person and just a character used to make Plato's points
Can't say I've read any Aristotle yet
Plato/Socrates didn't like Homer much from what I've read
But both seem like legends in Greece and around the world, which is interesting
I think Plato's criticism of Homer was that he depicted Gods as having flaws (and just generally wrote stories that weren't purely positive), which is supposedly a bad influence on people
Some of his ideas of censorship didn't age too well in my opinion, compared to his other ideas
