For anyone else curious on the context and foreseeable consequences, a [great comment from /r/geopolitics]
> Nazarbayev is an extremely influential figure in the entire Former Soviet Union
His policies have steered the entire Eurasian Economic Union, making it a primarily economic rather than political union, and he has managed to keep the country on it's multi-vector foreign policy with good amounts of success
He's used the resources of the country to great effect, of course, but his true legacy will be transforming Kazakhstan into a great place to do diplomacy
> He's also a brutal ruler who has overseen the creation of a Personality Cult, managed the opposition, and built an entirely new capital city because he thought it would be a good idea
And now he's just resigned very suddenly
> Where does this leave Kazakhstan
> 1
His immediate replacement, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, is a firm part of Nazarbayev's patrimonial network and has been for a while
The Diplomat, on October 30^th, [called him second in power to only Nazarbayev] As Tokayev is part of the network, on the face of things he will keep to the same policies
This isn't a case where it's Mirziyoyev coming to power as a compromise - Tokayev is a clear choice from Nazarbayev
A succession struggle is therefore unlikely, meaning the country can still engage with the world as Nazarbayev intended
> 2
In terms of Central Asia, the Authoritarian International, as termed by Vitali Silitski, will be active
Expect to see other Central Asian leaders attempt to reinforce Tokayev's position through preemptive containment of democratising forces
There may be some moves from the opposition to try and force through change, but given how powerful of a position Tokayev is in, it's unlikely it will succeed
Remember, especially in this region, just because an election is contested doesn't mean it's fair
A genuine opposition candidate may be fielded, but this serves two purposes: first, it provides a way for the populace to air anger; secondly, it provides an opportunity for the President to show how strong his network is
It may be the case where a genuine opposition candidate is not fielded now, but eventually one may be
The very worst I can see it going is another Andijan but that is extremely unlikely given the differences between Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan
> 3
The EEU is a different story
I am not aware if Tokayev has the same views as Nazarbayev on the organisation, but it's likely he does
However, what distinguished Nazarbayev was his authority, his gravitas
Simply put, Tokayev lacks this - there is now a potential for Putin to reform the EEU into a political rather than economic focused union
However, this would take time and would still be hard given recent developments in Kyrgyzstan and Armenia and Lukasheko's general flip-flopping
Putin has authority as well, but he will doubtless still face opposition if he wants to do this
> 4
Which brings us to Russia and the Russians in Kazakhstan
No, there likely won't be an annexation of Russian-majority areas
It's better for Russia to keep this as a bargaining chip
> 5
On the bigger picture
If Tokayev keeps the multi-vector policy, which it is safe to assume he will, then little will change
Nazarbayev has set up Kazakhstan as a diplomatic hub
What may change is that some Nazarbayev-era officials go in a mix of Tokayev trying to keep power and also to clear the human rights record to attract investment
Mirziyoyev did it, Otunbayeva, Atambayev and Jeenbekov have done similar, it wouldn't be surprising to see a little window-dressing here
> All in all, this is very sudden - looking at www
akorda
kz, the official government website, it hasn't even updated to show the change
He was engaging in regular activities, such as opening a Mosque, yesterday
It was probably planned, but kept from the populace
The entire government was fired by Nazarbayev earlier this year - Nazarbayev may have faced some pressure but remember, he is extremely powerful
Moreover, he will only be out of power in name for a short while, since he has fostered so many connections within the Kazakhstani political sphere
>  Tokayev will try to make a mark, which he very well may do, and will probably be the candidate for Nur Otan in the next election
He will win if he is, but the margin is important
It likely will not be in the 90%'s, since that requires mobilising an entire patrimonial network which he probably won't be able to do, so watching the percentage of his win is important
Of course, elections won't be held until next year, so he has time to plan unless he wants to have a snap election
> That's about it
**More of the same internally and locally, but with a potential for change in the EEU** - but nothing is certain at this stage
Tokayev may run but that isn't even certain

I am not European, but I feel for the people who live in Barcelona, Ibiza or even Venice having to put up with so many obnoxious tourists, not respecting local culture, puking on the streets and overcrowding every place
That is why I will never go there unless I know I will live there and not bother the local people
Agree
Rotterdam has horrible buildings
[Sounds like Boracua
Old, snobby and sad
Kind of
But that is because think of Northern Europe
I don't know why, but I think of London or Hamburg, instead of Rome and Athens
I think it's the other way around
It's the gender of the noun which determined the gender of the God
It is as old as Indo-European and you know that all Indo-European folks has a similar religion
You mean this
We have it in Colombia, we just don't use it to dry the dishes, I mean you probably need to put a towel under it or something, right
Excuse me if this Colombian man meddles in your all-European discussion, but there is something that must be said about Romance languages
Spanish to Italian and Portuguese, what Norwegian is to Swedish and Danish respectively
Spanish is like the one major language in the middle
We understand Italian phonetics, but if don't pay attention they speak gibberish to us
We would be able to write down the words, but not know their meaning
We understand Portuguese when it is written and spoken very slowly, but their phonetics are very weird: full of nasal sounds, guttural consonants and sounds we don't have in Spanish

Awful energy policies
In the Caribbean Coast we have the most expensive energy service of Colombia and, despite all this, we depend on a single station located outside the region
No one has ever thought that we could change to renovable energy like solar energy, wind energy or even a hydroelectrical
So, when such station is damaged, the entire region (7 departments with about 20 million people) fall into a blackout
Until that happens, we have to endure with prohibitive prices
I saw cases in which entire families have lost everything because they can't pay their energy service and my family and I were at risk of losing our house because we couldn't pay it
So is English in Ireland more common than Irish
If so that's a shame, good that you want to preserve it
Is irish a Germanic language or another sub family
It's a shame, I hope you can achieve what Paraguay or Spain did, having most of its population bilingual, that'd need a lot of government effort tho
Que bueno, creo que me siento igual que tu en ese aspecto(entendí completamente el 98%, pero en significado el 100% también) que bueno ver que nuestras lenguas son prácticamente entendibles mutuamente
I prefer mariposa
Papillon sounds like papilla to me (porridge)
I can see why it could be annoying, I wouldn't try to do it myself, but I can also see why they'd try to do it (maybe they don't wanna seem weird or foreign and just fail at it beautifully, who knows)
And yes, we get it all wrong, that's how we ourselves identify fake Spanish people here
(Fake Spanish people: people who were born here but use a fake Spanish accent to "enhance" their european ancestry) pretty lame
When I said it I meant the whole thing, latin America if you will, but these people are usually Mexican, if that's what you want to know
Dumb tourists asking about cocaine is relatively common in Colombia this does not surprise me
I agree those costs could be lower than rebuilding
On the other side, I also know the military uses really simple systems and technology, as with time you get to know all possible errors in a small chip
The Troubleshooting is then easier in critical moments
Maybe I'll be excused as I'm not European, but still:
I can't get why I don't know too much about the Thirty Years War, despite being so trascendent in human history
It's just the details are up to me because they're very confusing
No wonder why they have such opinion about him, considering the wanton slaughter they enacted in Ireland
Not to mention that one of it's components even had colonies in Africa and the Caribbean
Colonialism at that time was an European thing, so yes
That would count
Why such thing happens
From my perspective, it's like we weren't taught about the Internal Conflict that our country is currently suffering since the 50's.
I'm a student in Paris
\-  I thought education was gonna be better, not that it is bad, I just thought it was going to be way better than ours, it's not
Also thought people were gonna be smarter, again not the case
\- I thought it was going to be colder, it is not that cold, especially this year
I was also expecting a lot of rain
You should go to the tropics to understand what a lot of rain means
\- I actually thought people were gonna be colder and not interested in making friends and that is not the case at all
There are lots of assholes here but lots of nice people too
\-A lot of catholic people, I pretty much thought they were already extinct on this side of the world
\- Customer service sucks, I don't know if I was expecting otherwise but even after years living here, it's still shocking how badly they can treat clients
\- Smelly people
Probably a minority but it is definitely true
We have the very same D sound in Spanish
It is not that hard
To me, the worst ones are the ones that have two or more R sounds like recruteur
The D is an aproximant between vowels and at the end of the word, for example: ciudad, vencindad, moda, etc
are all pronounce with the same phoneme
You basically stick your tongue out, but don't make any contact with your teeth
It does
It's the same place and form of articulation: an interdental voiced approximant, maybe the Danes velarise it a bit, but it is basically the same sound
Spaniards pronounce the d in ciudad, differently, but in South America, we say it just the same as the Danish D.
Yes
They talk fast and drop many consonants, like Andalusians
I know I am not Spanish, but I do speak Spanish and that depends
Latin is incomprehensible to me, but Mediaeval Spanish is easy to understand, in fact, some Jewish communities from Turkey, Greece and other places in the Balkans are are descendants of Sephardic Jews and their language is Ladino, which is basically Old Spanish with some Hebrew words and I understand 100% of what they said, even more than Papiamento, Portuguese or Chileans (not joking)
A man speaking Ladino:
You can hear some archaisms like racinas vs
raíces
Why does Kero from Sakura Card Captors speaks like a low-class Mexican
We do the same in Colombia
There's also Varsovia for Warsaw that comes to mind, and Mexico City used to be México Distrito Federal (but that was changed a few years ago to Ciudad de México)
In Colombia the exchange is 4000 ish pesos for a euro
In Latin America, we always call it: Sacro Imperio Románico Germánico
So weird
And we can assume, that's why you set reminders and not 'rememberers'
Just to clarify, it would be “Los Gansos cometieron un frauds fiscal”. Unless you’re talking about someone nicknamed “El Gansos
Anyway, what were they even teaching
Could you give some names
I am learning Danish and it would be helpful
They are probably French
French people tend to learn Spanish rather than Italian and since it's really similar, they may get to that conclusion
I also feel like French-speaking people don't actually realize how *isolated* they are compared to Spanish/Italian/Portuguese speakers
To me it's more like:
Portuguese: Reeeeeally easy (as almost the same language) especially once you know the main differences with Spanish and you can replicate them
Brazilian is easier, though
Italian: You don't need any basics, you're still able to understand a lot of things since pronunciation is really similar
I've been told that once you have the basics, it's almost as easy as Portuguese but I doubt it
French: They keep the same structure as the rest of us, words are pretty much the same and once you decode the language, you are able to get pretty much 90% of the written language
Listening and speaking are still a pain in the ass
Romanian: We share some words and there are others that are similar but aside from that, it's really different
OMG same with me, I didn't really think it was possible to understand Romanian at all
I think it says they found out that dogs area domesticated wolfs and that started 15
000 years ago
I understand the same thing about the glaciation
The last thing it's that DNA tests suggest that DNA from both wolfs and dogs didn't evolve in the past 100
000 years cause it's clear they are still morphologically dogs
This was fun
Do you if it's easier for us than for French people for example
I'm gonna guess that is easier for Italians cause it kinda looks like it but I'm pretty sure I got the wolf reference because it's similar to the French *loup* and I think all of the words I got would have been easy to pick up by a French speaker too
I used to say "Q-ee"
Aw the fact that a Russian calls him Gabito just made my day <3 It’s pretty awesome, yeah :)
Spanish speaker fluent in French here
Spanish absolutely helps you with French, they are basically the same language (as are the other Romance languages) but with a complete different pronunciation
When you are fluent in these two, Italian gets incredibly easy too
To be honest they never really specified that for me
They just told us to bag every island with the closest continent at hand
But Oceanía was pretty much just islands
Australia, not a continent, just a big island, up until hawaii and as far east as Easter island
Basically half of the pacific ocean
I feel English as one of the easiest languages to learn in the world
Literally, I could even speak it the whole day without saying a damned word in Spanish
I like it
But my dear Spanish is my dear Spanish
I agree
Many towns of Colombia are just like Spanish towns 100 years ago
Italians and Portuguese people usually feel integrated here
Romanians and Frenchies not so much
These are rather exotic spicy cultures for them
My family is from Bayonne and I totally agree
All of the South West is far more "Spanish" than it is "French".
Sometimes the expressions looks Spanish: ça pegue
Caguer
Etc
My name
Yeah, but Monterrey, the second largest city in Mexico, is only a 4hr drive from San Antonio, and I know people who drive that often
To this day, no one knows who ordered the death of Jorge Eliecer Gaitán, a candidate for the Liberal Party
Despite being the candidate of a traditional party, he was a socialist at heart and had a lot of popularity, to the point that in 1950, Colombia was expecting a landslide victory of him over the conservative candidate
The thing is, after he was killed, the entire country fallen into anarchy, in an event known as "El Bogotazo", in which an angered country directed its rage towards the State, which was perceived as the responsible of his death
After "El Bogotazo", the internal conflict that plagued our country since then, began
His death was so relevant that cut our history in two, but no one really knows who really ordered his death
Some say it was a nobody known as Juan Roa Sierra, but most people think he was killed by the conservatives
The debate is open to this day
I made a joke about Romanians:
"Absolut adevarat
Nimeni nu aminteste, romanii sunt latini". That would mean "Absolutely right
Everybody forgets that Romanians are Latins".
Do you think if the possible king would have chosen the tricolor, have been accepted as the monarch of France
I read that he was a Chinese spy and the day of his dissapearance, a PLA submarine brought him to China, where he lived until his death
Curiously enough, a similar story can be told about my city, Barranquilla
No one knows the exact year was founded
But we only know its founders were ranchers from Galapa who settled in a place known as "Barrancas de San Nicolás" or Saint Nicholas' Ravines, in a year between 1627 and 1637
What a surprise
Another Non European here
Did you realized Croatoan was the name of the virus that caused the Apocalypse enacted by Lucifer in Supernatural, Season 4
That's the sad thing, my friend
Maybe we would never know
Gaitan was like our JFK, except he didn't had the chance to be president
I feel extremely dumb for not knowing, but what is a bidet
Not in my country
We have a strong regional pride and our way of speaking is part of it
However, some people are able to speak in different dialects at the same time
A friend of mine is from Bogota but can speak a nearly perfect Caribbean Coast dialect, which is not as easy as it seems
In Bogota, people speak slow, low and with something like a hissing
But in the Caribbean Coast, we speak faster, something similar like Puerto Ricans, but distinctively Colombian
In my case is Iran
I love its history and culture before the Ayatollahs ruined everything
But I can't understand why this happens
Dinners being a big deal
I appreciate cooking once or twice per week but most of the times I just want to have a sandwich or yoghurt with fruit
Also, just tea or coffee for breakfast is sad
I've had this argument with pretty much every European or North American I've dated
The basic colombian chocolate is different than w "heiße Schokolade", is somewhat more watery and less sweet
Also a substitute for the cheese that is usually used for this, is dificult to find in Germany
After 7 years living here i have not been able to found anything similar to do this
Yeah, breakfast is important too but due to lack of time, people tend to keep it simple
On the weekends or every now and then we can have amazingly large breakfasts, though
Oh, I'd be fine with that, I could add tuna to it
I forgot to say on my first comment that a sandwich is not an acceptable lunch but I somehow think that's more American than European (although French people sometimes do it)
Queso fresco = para untar en el pan
Porque nunca vi eso
Siempre lo hice con queso doble crema,no se consigue nada parecido en Europa (o no lo he conseguido hasta ahora)
Oh wow, we're exactly the same about dinner, this is surprisingly weird :)
No, no, se refiere a quesos poco madurados
Nunca habia rssuchado a nadie (colombiano) llamarlo queso fresco
Y de los nombrados en Wiki no todos son para ponerlo en el chocolate, o por lo menos no todos se derriten, como yo lo conozxo
Escribimos solo en inglés, se dice que crece en los submarinos del país.  La traducción automática probablemente conduciría a hallazgos extraños
What about Aldi
I've been to both in Paris and they sucked, then in Madrid I usually go the nicest Aldi ever that would put to shame any Parisian Monoprix
How about Denmark and Sweden unite and eat fish together like the good ol days
The only obscure one I know is Fukuoka because of a [famous Bachata song]
Don’t worry the Brexit negotiations will be done as soon as our infrastructure projects are completed
That's why you use moisturiser
Bogotá is like Ancient Rome: huge, overpopulated, and with all commodities you can't find elsewhere in the country
Bogotá has the best cultural festivals, the best concerts and the feel you're in a 1st world city like New York, only with less skyscrapers, and more poverty
Also, stay safe, because it's very likely you'll be robbed at least once
Seriously guys, the city is an urban jungle
The city is a great place to live, if you like a rushy way of life
If you like a peaceful place to live, Bogotá it's not your place
This one isn't even that bad, it's worse when you have to remember that 16 and below isn't dix + six, but seize and now it's "quatre-vingt-dix-si
nonononon, quatre-vingt-seize" Been there, done that more times than I'd like to admit
Depending of the region
In the Caribbean Coast, which has a more conservative culture, you can find them but not that much
But in the Andean Coast, which is more cosmopolitan, you can see thousands of people with beards everywhere
That will not happen here, especially with the low amount of English speakers in this country
Indigenous languages are another story
Many of them have dissapeared, like the Mokaná language and Spanish is devouring them
I'm studying in Paris
Hopefully, I'll be able to stay, don't want to go back

Why does Kero from Sakura Card Captors speaks like a low-class Mexican
We do the same in Colombia
There's also Varsovia for Warsaw that comes to mind, and Mexico City used to be México Distrito Federal (but that was changed a few years ago to Ciudad de México)
In Colombia the exchange is 4000 ish pesos for a euro
In Latin America, we always call it: Sacro Imperio Románico Germánico
So weird
And we can assume, that's why you set reminders and not 'rememberers'
Just to clarify, it would be “Los Gansos cometieron un frauds fiscal”. Unless you’re talking about someone nicknamed “El Gansos
Anyway, what were they even teaching
Could you give some names
I am learning Danish and it would be helpful
They are probably French
French people tend to learn Spanish rather than Italian and since it's really similar, they may get to that conclusion
I also feel like French-speaking people don't actually realize how *isolated* they are compared to Spanish/Italian/Portuguese speakers
To me it's more like:
Portuguese: Reeeeeally easy (as almost the same language) especially once you know the main differences with Spanish and you can replicate them
Brazilian is easier, though
Italian: You don't need any basics, you're still able to understand a lot of things since pronunciation is really similar
I've been told that once you have the basics, it's almost as easy as Portuguese but I doubt it
French: They keep the same structure as the rest of us, words are pretty much the same and once you decode the language, you are able to get pretty much 90% of the written language
Listening and speaking are still a pain in the ass
Romanian: We share some words and there are others that are similar but aside from that, it's really different
OMG same with me, I didn't really think it was possible to understand Romanian at all
I think it says they found out that dogs area domesticated wolfs and that started 15
000 years ago
I understand the same thing about the glaciation
The last thing it's that DNA tests suggest that DNA from both wolfs and dogs didn't evolve in the past 100
000 years cause it's clear they are still morphologically dogs
This was fun
Do you if it's easier for us than for French people for example
I'm gonna guess that is easier for Italians cause it kinda looks like it but I'm pretty sure I got the wolf reference because it's similar to the French *loup* and I think all of the words I got would have been easy to pick up by a French speaker too
I used to say "Q-ee"
Aw the fact that a Russian calls him Gabito just made my day <3 It’s pretty awesome, yeah :)
Spanish speaker fluent in French here
Spanish absolutely helps you with French, they are basically the same language (as are the other Romance languages) but with a complete different pronunciation
When you are fluent in these two, Italian gets incredibly easy too
To be honest they never really specified that for me
They just told us to bag every island with the closest continent at hand
But Oceanía was pretty much just islands
Australia, not a continent, just a big island, up until hawaii and as far east as Easter island
Basically half of the pacific ocean
I feel English as one of the easiest languages to learn in the world
Literally, I could even speak it the whole day without saying a damned word in Spanish
I like it
But my dear Spanish is my dear Spanish
I agree
Many towns of Colombia are just like Spanish towns 100 years ago
Italians and Portuguese people usually feel integrated here
Romanians and Frenchies not so much
These are rather exotic spicy cultures for them
My family is from Bayonne and I totally agree
All of the South West is far more "Spanish" than it is "French".
Sometimes the expressions looks Spanish: ça pegue
Caguer
Etc
My name
Yeah, but Monterrey, the second largest city in Mexico, is only a 4hr drive from San Antonio, and I know people who drive that often
To this day, no one knows who ordered the death of Jorge Eliecer Gaitán, a candidate for the Liberal Party
Despite being the candidate of a traditional party, he was a socialist at heart and had a lot of popularity, to the point that in 1950, Colombia was expecting a landslide victory of him over the conservative candidate
The thing is, after he was killed, the entire country fallen into anarchy, in an event known as "El Bogotazo", in which an angered country directed its rage towards the State, which was perceived as the responsible of his death
After "El Bogotazo", the internal conflict that plagued our country since then, began
His death was so relevant that cut our history in two, but no one really knows who really ordered his death
Some say it was a nobody known as Juan Roa Sierra, but most people think he was killed by the conservatives
The debate is open to this day
I made a joke about Romanians:
"Absolut adevarat
Nimeni nu aminteste, romanii sunt latini". That would mean "Absolutely right
Everybody forgets that Romanians are Latins".
Do you think if the possible king would have chosen the tricolor, have been accepted as the monarch of France
I read that he was a Chinese spy and the day of his dissapearance, a PLA submarine brought him to China, where he lived until his death
Curiously enough, a similar story can be told about my city, Barranquilla
No one knows the exact year was founded
But we only know its founders were ranchers from Galapa who settled in a place known as "Barrancas de San Nicolás" or Saint Nicholas' Ravines, in a year between 1627 and 1637
What a surprise
Another Non European here
Did you realized Croatoan was the name of the virus that caused the Apocalypse enacted by Lucifer in Supernatural, Season 4
That's the sad thing, my friend
Maybe we would never know
Gaitan was like our JFK, except he didn't had the chance to be president
I feel extremely dumb for not knowing, but what is a bidet
Not in my country
We have a strong regional pride and our way of speaking is part of it
However, some people are able to speak in different dialects at the same time
A friend of mine is from Bogota but can speak a nearly perfect Caribbean Coast dialect, which is not as easy as it seems
In Bogota, people speak slow, low and with something like a hissing
But in the Caribbean Coast, we speak faster, something similar like Puerto Ricans, but distinctively Colombian
In my case is Iran
I love its history and culture before the Ayatollahs ruined everything
But I can't understand why this happens
Dinners being a big deal
I appreciate cooking once or twice per week but most of the times I just want to have a sandwich or yoghurt with fruit
Also, just tea or coffee for breakfast is sad
I've had this argument with pretty much every European or North American I've dated
The basic colombian chocolate is different than w "heiße Schokolade", is somewhat more watery and less sweet
Also a substitute for the cheese that is usually used for this, is dificult to find in Germany
After 7 years living here i have not been able to found anything similar to do this
Yeah, breakfast is important too but due to lack of time, people tend to keep it simple
On the weekends or every now and then we can have amazingly large breakfasts, though
Oh, I'd be fine with that, I could add tuna to it
I forgot to say on my first comment that a sandwich is not an acceptable lunch but I somehow think that's more American than European (although French people sometimes do it)
Queso fresco = para untar en el pan
Porque nunca vi eso
Siempre lo hice con queso doble crema,no se consigue nada parecido en Europa (o no lo he conseguido hasta ahora)
Oh wow, we're exactly the same about dinner, this is surprisingly weird :)
No, no, se refiere a quesos poco madurados
Nunca habia rssuchado a nadie (colombiano) llamarlo queso fresco
Y de los nombrados en Wiki no todos son para ponerlo en el chocolate, o por lo menos no todos se derriten, como yo lo conozxo
Escribimos solo en inglés, se dice que crece en los submarinos del país.  La traducción automática probablemente conduciría a hallazgos extraños
What about Aldi
I've been to both in Paris and they sucked, then in Madrid I usually go the nicest Aldi ever that would put to shame any Parisian Monoprix
How about Denmark and Sweden unite and eat fish together like the good ol days
The only obscure one I know is Fukuoka because of a [famous Bachata song]
Don’t worry the Brexit negotiations will be done as soon as our infrastructure projects are completed
That's why you use moisturiser
Bogotá is like Ancient Rome: huge, overpopulated, and with all commodities you can't find elsewhere in the country
Bogotá has the best cultural festivals, the best concerts and the feel you're in a 1st world city like New York, only with less skyscrapers, and more poverty
Also, stay safe, because it's very likely you'll be robbed at least once
Seriously guys, the city is an urban jungle
The city is a great place to live, if you like a rushy way of life
If you like a peaceful place to live, Bogotá it's not your place
This one isn't even that bad, it's worse when you have to remember that 16 and below isn't dix + six, but seize and now it's "quatre-vingt-dix-si
nonononon, quatre-vingt-seize" Been there, done that more times than I'd like to admit
Depending of the region
In the Caribbean Coast, which has a more conservative culture, you can find them but not that much
But in the Andean Coast, which is more cosmopolitan, you can see thousands of people with beards everywhere
That will not happen here, especially with the low amount of English speakers in this country
Indigenous languages are another story
Many of them have dissapeared, like the Mokaná language and Spanish is devouring them
I'm studying in Paris
Hopefully, I'll be able to stay, don't want to go back
