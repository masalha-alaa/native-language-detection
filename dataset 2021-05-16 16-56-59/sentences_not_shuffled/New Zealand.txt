Is that the town that you pass by on the way to Heathrow Airport from London
I remember catching a train from Paddington towards Windsor Castle and/or Heathrow and the name Slough seems to come up a lot
The common one here is “the traffic”
The funniest ones I heard when I was young were these, “the bus has de-railed”, and “the tram’s tyre has gone flat”
There are in fact jobs like that out there that are like this - in my industry and others the Big Four firms don’t only do financial practice advice, but do all kinds of strategic management and commercial/operational management consultancy work too
In this case yep I can imagine a Swiss coming in doing consultant work like such
That's horrible, but you can choose which version of English you want spell check to be in, in your browser, as well as in your office software
Took me years of being annoyed by having all my Maori words underlined before I figured this out
Oh god I know someone who says "gas" for petrol
It's confusing because we also do buy/use a lot of natural gas in my town
Not accurate
It's just more aromatic
I'm pretty sure it has way more citrus in it
Not European
New Zealand
The biggest shocks are:
Shop staff in general don’t say “hi” to customers at all in the Northeast (all the big cities like New York, Philly, Washington DC, Boston, and even suburban smaller cities like Harrisburg or Rochester NY), unlike New Zealand
Bank notes are in the same colour
Metric systems aren’t used
Paper bags were available at supermarkets
In a supposedly clean green New Zealand until 2018 you would be given plastic bags
Coins: the higher denominations don’t necessarily mean larger size
Also there are still 1c coins
Prices aren’t tip and tax inclusive
In NZ you pay what the signs says
People don’t really trust non-chain independent/artisan restaurants, cafes, shops
(My family in the US would loathe to visit standalone cafes
Even though they do know they exist in say San Francisco or Northeastern big cities) Franchised chain stores penetrate to a far deeper extent economically and culturally than NZ
It can be ignorant of the outside world in amusing ways
And sorry, it happens to both the left and right
I have seen plenty of American leftards left with egg on their face on Reddit and elsewhere on social media
You can’t order small sized drinks and meals
Motorways/interstates penetrate everywhere unlike New Zealand
And road conditions are years ahead of New Zealand even in states with relatively bad roads (say Pennsylvania)
Utilities like electricity and water are probably worse on the other hand
I think for 1, it may also be a regional thing too
In the Midwest Detroit people do say hi to customers
Other than that it is a big city vs smaller places difference
Up until 1990 NZ has 1c and 2c coins too
But they got phased out
My family have lived in Pittsburgh, Rochester, now Detroit, and go to tier 2 cities around the country a lot
They are middle class working professionals
I was taken back when they asked me whether the cafe in NZ I’m bringing them to are chains places
In NZ usually the local places have better food even though the price differences between chains (say, Starbucks) and locals (say, the Unknown Chapter cafe, in Central Chch) are minimal
No offence taken regarding your last point
Everyone’s different, I’m more foodie and travel oriented than them (while I don’t care as much about cars sports or consumer electronics (!))
But glad to know that if I ask for local favourite places to eat I wouldn’t be treated as a weirdo in the US
But, but, but
Nicholas Sarkozy is descendant of Hungarian immigrants
I thought
- Schneider Electric was German (it is in fact French)
- Alstom was English (is French)
- Opel was German (was American, now French)
-Braun Appliances were German (is American)
- Rowntree was American (was UK before acquired by Nestle)
- Nestle was American (is Swiss)
I always know Addidas is German, but I thought Puma was Hong Kong like G2000 or Espirit
until I learn it is German by googling
I thought it was German until now, glad to know its true origin
At my German class in high school (New Zealand) we had to memorise the locations of major German cities and tourist towns in German
The one I always struggled with the most is Hanover (Hannover in German) and I never understood why we had to learn about Hanover and pinpoint it on a map
Well the textbook was published in the UK
And then I learned the House of Hanover some years later, when I was at university
(Also: in our term exam for the German class there was a section where we just filled in names [in German] of the German cities we learned from class on a map of Germany
It turned the German exam into a Geography question
Growing up in HK (years before the handover) baked beans had been common “ordinary folk” dinner fares at homes for almost all socio-economic groups
They were usually from China or the UK
The ones from the UK were usually marketed as “English-style tomato sauce baked beans” showing off they were quality product
Then when we came to New Zealand I got used to Watties baked beans (which is owned by Heinz, but Watties started as a local company) for breakfasts and baked beans on toasts
I thought Airbus has no single home country, it has always been EU-wide plus UK
If it is a company registered somewhere I would have guessed the register would be in France
I thought I saw it in Queensland (Brisbane and/or the Gold Coast)
when I was there last July
I didn’t notice them when I was in Melbourne, where there were two or three local gelato chains around
I have a German friend who said one game he and his friends used to play when they were small is to look at car licence plates and guess where they come from
Coming from Hong Kong and New Zealand it is an archivist or transport buff’s dream: classifying things by the initials
I know from Australian and US licence plates will have different colours and designs depending on the states, and Canada according to provinces, while France shows car licences with the department numbers it was issued from (75 is Paris, 93 is the notorious Seine-Saint-Denis)
But I didn’t realise German licence plates could be classified by the alphabets in addition to state where it is issued
I think from a marketing standpoint it is some exotic places, and exotic foreign sounding = high quality premium product
Sorry to chine in as a foreigner
I’m a history geek myself and my area of interests is on world history from AD/CE 1500 to today
I keep noticing that if things turned out only slightly differently in the 19th and early 20th century like a different set of monarchs, leaders, and other countries’ response, we wouldn’t have a separate Austria today
It may be a Germany with Vienna as the capital, or even a pie in the sky scenario, multiple capitals and different branches of government divided between Vienna, Berlin, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Munich and Magdeburg for starters (!)
I still think that history turned in a particular way that Austria today is a separate country
(Please forgive me if it’s not appropriate for a foreigner to butt in here)
Oh I listed Magdeburg here because it was an ancient seat of government under a few Middle Age Holy Roman Emperors
So a historically-minded government may decide to keep some government branches there to remind people that Magdeburg was one of the old capitals
Alternatives would be Nuremberg or Quedlinburg
That sounds like some countries inEast Asia
There is a proverbial “I have time to die but no time for getting sick” in Hong Kong
Also work stress can vary very widely even within the same sector
I have been working at the same workplace under different CEOs: at one point the workplace can only be described as laid back and like semi holiday: people were treated kindly but people work because they were motivated to work well, now under a different top guy it is an “you do nothing but work during work hours”, “we got all these performance targets to hit
If you don’t hit them this year then haha”. All that is in New Zealand
And I’ve been told Australia is the same: it really depends which workplace you end up at, as the cultures vary extremely widely depending on the individual organisation and their current boss
The normal practice in New Zealand is you pay exactly the food and drink you ordered yourself, although I have been to occasions where the bill is split evenly across all
(Then for Asians: immigrants of my parents’ generation will take turns treating the group for meals
My generation tend to go Dutch
Native born European Kiwis of course go Dutch)
What’s the sub, if you don’t mind me asking
Here in New Zealand you don’t get the equivalent number the IRD number until you open a bank account or start your first student job, which are typically at 17
In some cases parents open Kiwisavers (retirement fund) for them then it becomes 10/11
People say German or French bureaucracy are bad
But I have had experience with NZ one (not known for its bad bureaucracy) that can be almost as strange too
Not me though, my family didn’t see any needs until I had to when I got a cash prize for my academics and I was starting university soon
Can always go in the other direction
How about when you're visiting another planet
I have a pervert wish: wanting to visit Eisenhüttenstadt
hmm I wonder why
When I was in Berlin in 2015, I walked around the eastern part of the city after getting off at the terminus of U1, I can’t remember the name for the S-Bahn station next to it, but the scene of rows if apartment blocks reminded me of Beijing and (from videos I had seen) Pyongyang
I went to Lyon on a day trip from
Paris in 2015
Once I got off at the main TGV train station (Gare de Lyon-Part-Dieu) there was a guy (that guy looked “European” French) who approached me in English asking if I need a ticket for the local transport and he has some on sale
Remember this is France and people don’t suddenly start speaking in English to someone for no reason, so I concluded he must have been a scammer
After I said no once, seeing I got from the ticket info booth to a vending machine, he was very insistent on me buying a ticket from him
The funny thing was there was a ticket inspector at the end of my metro ride into the city from Part Dieu
He had a hand held device that checked whether the ticket was legitimate
I got a ticket from the machine, so there was no drama for me
But if I got the ticket from that guy I would be in huge trouble
PS: another funny thing
The vending machines don’t accept notes and only coins
When I tried to ask the lady at the info booth if I could buy a ticket from her because I don’t have enough coins, she said no I must buy tickets from the machine, and I didn’t have sufficient change then I just had to get the coins somewhere
So it turned into a detour to Relay and buying a bottle of water first before coming back with enough change to get the local public transport ticket (!)
Talk about being inflexible
It is a universal thing when you go to a concert or show here in New Zealand too, the exception is you always finish the ice-cream at the common area outside the concert hall/theatre, and never bring them inside
In New Zealand whenever I get to tourist hotspots around the South Island there’s 50% chance I hear German and the other French if they aren’t Chinese/Korean/Japanese/Indian tourists (I was born in Hong Kong, and I speak A little French, plus a few words in school German, in addition to English and Chinese)
It is a surreal thing that I don’t really hear any other languages that much
Kid you not, we had a nutritionist visiting my high school when I was a student back then, and gave us this talk about healthy eating and she said don’t drink too much fluid during meal because it would dilute your gastric acid
Places sell both ice-cream and wine (and also hot drinks and orange juice) in New Zealand
Come to think of it, at the Christchurch town hall you even get sandwiches, bratwurst, or cheese plus salami and crackers pack too if you want savoury
I remember going to a concert at Leipzig’s Gewandhaus in 2015, and (being used to seeing wine or ice-cream at classical concerts in New Zealand) I was surprised to find out that there was no ice-cream on sale during the interval, only wine
I always assume Germany as a whole is very honest and at New Zealand and Nordic-level of (lack in) corruption
Is this correct
Thanks
France does this too, if my memory serves right
I had wine in my mug at home by myself once (!), and swore that I’d never do it again
Wineglasses are designed in that shape for a reason - and I couldn’t get the fullest of the wine’s scent/aroma from drinking out of a mug
Cantonese comes very close to Russian here
The swear words are an art in itself
But it is also a social marker: if you are well educated m, are well off, and generally in humanities subject, you don’t swear
If you are well off but of STEM and/or Commerce/Business background, and work as Accountants, big corporation managers, investment bank bankers/traders, you do
You are a self-made man
You will swear
You are poor and engage in manual labour
You swear a lot too
I don't think they do though
It seems to me that many tourists want something that is different enough to be exotic, but similar enough to what their palate is used to, to be reassuring
So many of my countrymen go on these appalling "Contiki tours" and eat in tourist traps on purpose
My main food-finding method when travelling is look for a place that is not welcoming to me and where I don't understand anything
I loiter for a while, then follow a local in and try to copy them
It's always a surprise to see what I have just ordered
No kidding: I was told off often when I wrote in small or untidy scripts like when I was rushing things through or was tired
But I was told off once by a secretary at my old high school for the writing - it was so neat to her that she thought “you writing is like a girl’s”. I was in my late 20s, and hadn’t been back to Hong Kong for years then, and I was there as an adult and old boy at the school
Basically for Kiwis it is none of anyone’s business in the NZ culture to tell off another adult for their writing - so I was taken aback a bit by the conformism in the Hong Konger collectivist culture there as this is the thing I had outgrown/forgotten over the years
Same question
Have never seen anyone  (whether guys or girls) writing in “a” in NZ
This to me is a print font
I used to in high school, but it was never taught and something I just did for a while to be fancy, a few others and a couple of teachers did too
Not super uncommon but not usual
Do people joke about Macau, Goa, and Timor Leste (East Timor, or formerly the Portuguese Timor) too
Not really covered in NZ media aside from the odd article or two
I'm only familiar with it since I prefer international news sources to local ones
It'd be nice if Belarus got a new leader via fair elections, but I'm rather skeptical that will actually happen
Nope
Here media ownership is a good mix of crown owned, publicly traded shareholder owned, and privately owned
Of the privately owned, some are locally owned, and some by overseas investment firms and media conglomerates, none of which are linked to Rupert Murdoch as far as I can tell
But doesn't the individual retailer or chain set the prices
If manufacturing companies set the retail price there would be no competition in the market
Yeah because a guy from Brazil is the same as someone from Chile  and is the same as someone from Mexico  ha
I always get the impression Americans view the world as European , Black ( but you can't say that so they are African american no matter where they are from), Asian and Latin
Like fuck the thousands of the rest
A Guy from Madrid is the same as a Guy from Stockholm unless they speak then  the guy from Madrid is Latino because he speaks the language of Latinos therefore they fit into that niche
When I was growing up (both Hong Kong and New Zealand), all the teachers I had at school taught Chopin and Marie Curie were Polish
Some interesting antedote: a sibling emigrated to the US instead of New Zealand (we were Hong Kong in origin BTW just to make things clearer), and he always seems angry at what he sees as anti-American digs at the US everything from a number of Britons
I notice my UK-origin friends and work colleague do this quite often, they think it is tongue in cheek to tease Americans for say not having Guy Fawkes firework, but didn’t care/realise sometimes it is because of conscious history decision (on the issue of Guy Fawkes: none other than Geoege Washington himself forbade the US to observe the Guy Fawkes day)
Such type of behaviours towards Americans are largely absent or more muted from Aussies, curiously
This is a reason we are told trying to hide our online presence/activities as much as can, because it can land in your potential future employer, landlord, etc’s hands
At least in many English-speaking countries with insufficient privacy protection culture, this can mean you don’t get a job offer or lose out at the last hurdle because your potential employer learns from your social media presence online that you hold an unpopular political stance (even though legal but may be politically controversial/unpopular stance right now)
It’s not just the US, this practice is endemic in corporate cultures across the entire English-speaking world
And it is deemed neither illegal nor breaching any privacy protection and employment laws, and neither is it deemed unethical or immoral
What I have read is all advices/suggestions adapt to the practice, if you are found to be hosting a politically unpopular stance that costs you a potential job, shame on you for letting your beliefs become so publicly accessible that your potential employer has learned about this, and better effort needed in getting them hidden
I’ve seen France Televisions or LCI interviewing him for over 30 minutes, and they didn’t use subtitles
I’m trying to decipher the limit and convert this into an ordinary differential equation, ...
I know this is unrelated, but I learned from French classes the phrase « métro, boulot, dodo » which explains the daily grind in a graphic way
You can literally “feel” you dread waking up and turning up for work
I always remember the nightclub toilet guy saying " Freshen up for the Punani"
[New Zealand enters the chat]
When I was growing up our city seemed to have two speeds - some people started at about 19:00 and some people started about 12 or 1am
It was kind of weird because there were always drunk people leaving town just when I was getting there
We used to have these weird safety ads that pretended to be commercials:
Yep
Since she's also our head of state, it will technically be a victory for New Zealand as well
This is the scene at 3 am Saturday and Sunday - ie drinking started Friday/Saturday night - in Auckland CBD zone with lots of pubs (like the Viaduct Harbour, Wyndard Quarter), Wellington (Courtney Place), Christchurch (Oxford Terrace, Victoria Street) too
I was surprised by the original post, I thought the US has a generational divide that those under-45 are big into uninhibited drinking, while those older are almost total teetotalers
Moderate social only drinking only exists in non-UK Europe
(At least from French Germans Italians I know they are into moderate social drinking
I have never seen them getting drunk
Meanwhile all English-speaking countries seem to make uninhibited drinking a national culture)
L’apéro is one of the French habits I picked up through Alliance Française from their French classes and events
It’s cool to have a drink and a snack to chill out on Friday after work and before meals
I remember some shocking scene on my first trip to the UK in 2014 was seeing wasted people: one was at the Cambridge train station on a Thursday evening at 8 pm, the other is in London Saturday evening at bit earlier at 5 pm ish walking back from the National Gallery, there was a decently dressed person that got kicked out of a pub for being very intoxicated
I was shocked because you don’t see obviously drunk people coming out of pubs that early in New Zealand: a “better” time to check how many got drunk at an NZ pub would have been after 10:30 pm at the earliest, often it is more like after midnight
(From what I have seen in Australia it is similar to NZ, people normally don’t get drunk at 5 or 6 pm)
TIL
Funny that the French teachers and the French acquaintances I meet through Alliance Feancaise here in New Zealand never get drunk at the private parties or AF events
Maybe they are being polite
;-)
Sorry, AF = Alliance Française
We have events like Beaujolais nouveau tasting (with lots of authentic Brie, paté served with wine), Opening sessions at the annual French film festivals, and also at the end of each term’s French classes we being food and drinks to class to make a feast together between 7-8 of us in class plus the teacher
I know a woman from my French class, she is from Germany and her husband is French
They never come across as heavy drinkers from the parties I have been to
That makes sense, TIL
I hope that one day I can experience something like a French family lunch with the full courses and alcohols ( I think I can have up to 2
5 drinks at most at a meal)
One day I hope I will be invited to experience one ...
Not European myself, one of the sayings I heard on my first trip to Europe was in France - at the Provence region
Our native tour guide mentioned that Europe had been constantly at war at every level nonstop since the end of the heyday of the Roman Empire (after AD 200) until 1945
The period since WWII is the first time since the Roman Empire that Europe hasn’t had large scale wars for extended period
Of course there’s the Yugoslav Wars and Ukraine and Georgia and Armenia/Azerbaijan and Bow Turkey, but they aren’t like all the major powers in Europe are fighting each other
This is probably off topic on a European subreddit, but I do take that the next major war (and looking at things now, I think it will be a matter of if, not when the next major war will break out) will not be between European countries, or between any countries we count as part of “the West”. My pick is the next major war will break out in East or SE Asia
What was said about the UK applies to New Zealand too, except WWI and WWII are now viewed as nation building experience plus fighting for freedom here
Which is strange that literally no one under the age of 65 today in 2021 would have any experience taking up arms fighting in a war for New Zealand
(I’m discounting peacekeeping as real fighting a war type of serving, NZ has only involved in peacekeeping since Vietnam War half a century ago)
Nah here email is still the term
Gmail is the most popular provider outside of work email address though  although I still get the occasional Hotmail address  on resumes
XxCuNTpuNcHer69Xx at hotmail is not so professional though ha  ( example only, feel free to use although it's probably taken )
Try asking this question in /r/AskAnAfrican then, given France's colonial history
No, I'm just saying, if you were to ask Algeria, Senegal, Mali, et cetera which country had the most influence on their history, they would say France
And for New Zealand, I don't know if France would make the top 3, but the French doing nuclear testing in the Pacific and killing one of our protestors in an act of terrorism certainly helped shape sentiment about nuclear power here
As for the Maori, well the French were planning to subjugate the Maori and colonise their lands, only the British got there first
Hi all, I’m late to the party
The only language I understand well here is French (am learning it towards intermediate level), then remotely following that is Italian, and very little of Catalan
Surprisingly I find Spanish difficult to understand, and Portuguese and Romanian are kind of equally difficult for me to get their meanings
I always hear French in the context of formal announcements and speeches or news programs and narrations in documentaries, so it often sounds a little formal officialese in a very flat tone to me
(Learning towards B1 in French myself)
I always thought of Pavarotti or the Godfather
But bow I gave heRd more of native Italian speaking people I think everyday Italian talking sounds like middle aged to senior aged Chinese-speakers sitting at the park or at a restaurant with friends whinging over a cup of tea
The talks between middle aged Chinese-speakers chatting over a shared lunch don’t sound like Italian at all BTW - it would sound too rapid and Italian can sound too “composed” when compared with excited Cantonese or Hokkienese or Taiwanese or Mandarin social talks
A ex-workmate joked to me years ago that the only French sentence I ever need to know is « où sont les toilettes ? » when travelling in France - after I told him I was starting taking French courses
He speaks Portuguese and Hebrew in addition to English
Hahahaha, it’s more my personal preference
Most Kiwis would cpnsider French from the satirised “cheese eating surrender monkeys” or the Inspector Clouseau
It may be common to all Sino-Tibetan languages, although Thai sounds soft to me
Cantonese is probably the toughest sounding Sino-Tibetan language out there
A lot of other people say we sound like we’re always arguing (!)
Coincidentally I never get the reason the native English speakers say German sounds angry
Disclaimer: know Cantonese as 1st language speaker, and can speak simple-intermediate level (A2) Mandarin
LOL you should listen to talks when Cantonese speakers are really angry and arguing with each other
The insults are very colourful and the volume can wake up the grandma 6 blocks down the street
In Māori: Hōne māte hite wā tu a tawhane teru ta tāke whorehete, ouneri tū whainete aote tete hī whōkote ta mani
Māorifying the sentence is a bit tricky since there aren't many consonants and all syllables end in vowels
I grew up in Asia but have been in New Zealand since I was a teenager
In NZ society in general won’t make a big deal out of you whether you have been to university or not, and let alone which one :-p . But in Asia (at least in East Asia and I believe for SE Asia too), being graduates from prestigious (in their view) universities in the West or locally is a very big deal
There is still residual naked open snobbery from people who have been to Oxbridge or Ivy League or Stanford, Berkeley, Northeestern, Toronto, Waterloo, Melbourne etc, looking down upon people who come from “average universities” or with no tertiary education at all
Oxford does pretty well in some STEM areas too
I have someone close to me who is an academic in automotive eng and has done collaborations with people from Oxford
But it is true in general
I have a friend who is big humanities - literature geek - he is a lawyer BTW
One of the first places he visited when he got to the UK the first time was to visit Oxford because of the C.S. Lewis connections
He is not interested in STEM and gave Cambridge a miss due to its science reputation
I thought (like countries such as New Zealand and Taiwan) good researchers are elected fellows at institutes, but they are still mainly doing their work based at university
Is that like this in Germany too
PS: my family have academic links: my father is knee deep in history, while I have a brother who goes very deep in mech engineering (particularly automative related stuff)
Their researcher/professor acquaintances and friends tend to have dual roles at institutes and universities
And then have it traverse Russia, have North Korea open up to the world, and arrange for an underground tunnel to be build between South Korea and Japan
The end result being able to take a high speed train from London to Tokyo
At least one can dream
It's 9556 km from London to Tokyo in a straight line, so accounting for geography it would probably be about 10,000 km, or slightly over
At 400 km/hr that would make the journey slightly over 25 hours, probably a little bit longer due to border crossings
I just barely started school when the Kurt Waldheim affair was all over the news on TV
I didn’t realise how significant it was until years later at university level, that this was so sensitive because for the first time Austria had to confront that they were a willing member of the Axis as much as Germany, and not really a second Switzerland that got invaded by Nazi Germany
The reason I don't like it is because I'm a massive language nerd, but because people speak my native language so often I never get to really practice other ones
In my experience people in Greece, Sweden, Netherlands, Portugal, and most young people in France and Germany can all speak English really well
Which is a huge shame for me because I'm really good at French and I've been passively learning those others for years now
But I'll never be able to *really* use them because everyone just defaults to English when I make mistakes, so I never get better especially with my speaking competency
I envy you non-natives so much haha :(
ναι αφολουθώ(;) το subreddit r/GREEK και με βοηθά πολύ :)
It’s called Shandy in New Zealand and the UK
I think male guys asking for it will get laughed off, to many people it is considered a drink for ladies since the lemonade dilutes the bitter taste of hops and makes the beer “weaker”.
Meanwhile in New Zealand it is called in the wops (or the wop wop)
Grew up in Hong Kong before the 1997 Handover, and old enough to have been schooled by old school teachers who punished you for using American English
New Zealand was never that snobbish at even the stuffiest elite schools
Some of the most important differences: lorry is never used (truck/ute instead), we don’t say sweets here (lollies instead), football is very rarely used and mostly by UK immigrants (soccer), mince pie means savoury beef mince in gravy pie and not sweet raisin+candied peels mince pies you usually get at Christmas
Lux/vacuum is another one I remember from school textbooks
Do you have any unsweetened coffee choices in Italy
I love to get something like a dash of milk (not too much but just make it not completely black) in an iced coffee but not sweetened any way
Thanks
In New Zealand:
Twink = correction fluid = white out as in the US (twink even made it to certain NZ English dictionaries
It has been very rare)
Xerox = photocopy
Lux = vacuum cleaner
Google = web search
Universal
"bandaid" is a brand name as well
The generic term is sticking-plaster
This is interesting to me because a few of them are really similar here but different, eg "Thermoskanne" for vacuum flask - here that same company is just called Thermos, so we use "thermos" for vacuum flask
Not Europe: one thing is our capital Wellington is not the largest city and not the economic centre either, even though the stock market is based there
The largest city is Auckland and because it’s 3x the size of Christchurch the next largest city, and where 80% of immigrants to NZ live in Auckland it has a very different feel to anywhere else
The rest of the country call Aucklanders Jafas (“Just a *Friendly* Aucklander) and seriously hate Auckland
Both Aucklanders and the rest of the country refer the rest of the country as “south of the Bombay”.
One thing that is so unique is Paris is so much bigger than the next largest city Marseille
I come from New Zealand which is commonly thought of as a small country with a tiny population
Yet the largest city Auckland already has about the same population as Marseille
Many French cities are comparable to NZ’s in size
Same in New Zealand
The rest of the country hate Auckland
Both sides claim “New Zealand begins/ends at the Bombay” (Bombay Hill = the hilly range that is like an informal boundary for the Auckland region)
Quel honte !  What a shame
I have been to France but not Italy
Is Rome a bit like having Paris’s history and the government thing, but Milan has the economic centre and arrogance of Paris
Or there is no city in Italy that has Paris’s respective reputation within France, but rather Rome and Milan together share the equivalent reputation
I have a friend from high school here (New Zealand) who lives in Paris with his also-Kiwi wife
When we were catching up I asked him where France’s famously vibrant intellectuals/thinking scenes are
He said it’s now Berlin which is Europe’s centre for intellectuals where they congregate
Paris is only a shell from before the 1960s/70s and it is mostly tourists from outside Europe wanting to experience it, but not much of that remains
It seems to me that French people and people who live in France have a very rosy view of Berlin
New Zealand here and I have East Asian blood: “European” Kiwis dress more for  occasion but people don’t dress that differently according to socio-economic status, I have seen very similar style clothings even if they are rich Remuera/Fendalton compared with someone who went to more normal middle class high school, or are from lower middle class backgrounds
I remember meeting some people who are English and part of the Oxbridge educated, Fleet Street, City [of London] worker elite crowds, and who immigrated or were visiting to NZ, and they don’t dress any differently from someone from say Mt Albert or Westies in Auckland NZ (lower middle class)
Foe Asian immigrants and descents, your dress says a lot about your upbringing/background
This is some legacy from the original/ancestral homelands: in Asia people put on a much higher premium on dress and appearances - the cultural value is to dress to the best ability you can afford: even casual clothings are reflections of your own upbringing and socio-economic status
Funny this runs deep
in my own family too, each argument must be backed up by documentary or numerical evidence, only that I live in NZ and is of East Asian migrant background
You spelled cousin wrong
That looks like Auckland University in New Zealand
They look pretty pleasing to me, there are plenty of generic high rise apartment blocks around Germany that look uglier than these 10
The Bahnhof at Duisburg seems modernist
I walked around the area when I visited Germany in 2015
It looks average to me, not ugly but as you say people are mot liking the concept anymore
That could be used as Engineering School building
My old uni’s Engineering School in New Zealand looked like this until the 2016 renovation
It is not, parts of the eastern portion of Berlin looks more like Pyongyang
You’re right, it looks ouch
I spent a normal (workday) Monday morning there touring the city
Just be honest it has a few seedy red lights sex industry places and a few places/bars that look sketchy
Didn’t notice any junkies there but I imagine it will be a different tale if I were there during the evening
I think it is a myth to claim all of “Europe” has “free health care”. You pay a health premium contribution too in the form of either taxation or a health insurance premium-like health contribution
What it often means in welfare society is that you are not a citizen, you won’t receive the same degree of healthcare because you are not a contributor
Which is why there are national IDs and system of registration as to where you live
The case of arguing if “undocumented immigrants can receive treatment beyond emergency care” is unthinkable in Europe because they are not tax contributors
As far as I know, the only two societies with what you call closest to universal healthcare are the UK with the NHS, and Taiwan
In the case of the UK you still pay an NHS surcharge if you are resident foreigners or non/resident UK British citizens
Thanks, I stand corrected
For me, I'm a little bit of an armchair enthusiast of history
I don't really know what happened outside Britain, France, Germany, the Habsburg Empire when it comes to European history
And even for these countries, I only know the major events
It is literally one of the stepping stones to WWII, along with the Manchurian Incident (1931), the rise of Hitler and Nazi Germany (1933), Mussolini's invasion of Ethiopia (1936), the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937), the Anschluss of Austria, Munich (1938)
1930s were like a classic Greek tragedy, to borrowing from the Reader's Digest's Great Events of the 20th Century
I only know it as a precursor to WWII but not really specifically how it affected and still impacts Spain today
I learned about the land clearances in Scotland at high school Social Studies in NZ
It was presented as the peasants were kicked out and they flocked to the cities to become factory workers during the Industrial Revolution
This has been part of the New Zealand high school Year 11/5th Form History curriculum since forever
Everyone in NZ if they take History at NCEA Level 1 or the old School Cert will know this
(I didn't take history as I was a STEM student)
I learned it  for 6 weeks in my high school (in New Zealand) Social Studies/History class: from the 15th century explorations, the slave trade, to the 19th Century Age of New Imperialism: its causes and the Scramble for Africa, ending with the MacMillan "The Wind of Change" speech and decolonisation of the 1950s to 70s.
Did you guys learn how Britain achieved universal suffrage i.e. "real democracy" between the 18th century and 1969 (when the voting age was lowered to 18)
This is normally part of the curriculum for most Stage 1 university level Introductory 19th to 20th Century World History courses around the world
Thanks
I read some of it on my uncle's copy of the Reader's Digest's Great Events of the 20th Century
There was a chapter on the rise and fall of Mussolini and fascism: It mentioned the March on Rome, the assassination of Matteotti, his Ethiopian war, his fall in 1943, MSI, and final execution and hung upside down
But what you said above is even more detailed and fills some of the gaps I have
Thanks for filling us foreigners with the knowledge:
TIL They were separate uprisings
Always thought they were two parts of the same one from history books
Odd enough it was presented as the "Agricultural revolution" in the module that also included the Industrial Revolution and Information Revolution
I did pick that the land clearances were different from the two other technology revolutions
It must have been selected as you say, one consequence of the land clearances was dispossessed people went to NZ as settlers
Not European here (New Zealand): generally the observation is Kiwis don’t, apart from California, New York (and only know New York the city, not upstate), and maybe Hawaii
Maybe a stereotype view of Texas representing “Murrrica”. But that is the extent of it
People really know next to nothing about Wyoming Delaware or Nebraska
(Even Boston and New England are relatively unknown in NZ)
With regards to names, most can tell California, New York, Hawaii, Texas, maybe Nevada (Las Vegas
), but none beyond that
I think for things specific to Germany like Berlin S-Bahn, or what Leibniz the person accomplished German Wiki is more comprehensive
Engineering and science topics are “it depends”.
Wupperthal for me, weird since I've heard of all the cities before and after it and feel like I should know a city of that size
Same for me actually, Never heard of it
Then New Zealand reaps the benefit too: we are the only exporter of farmed Pacific salmon in the world (Chile used to as well, but their salmon farming had disappeared leaving NZ as a monopoly)
And nothing beats fresh Pacific salmon farmed in NZ, which I heard is much healthier than Atlantic salmon
Sorry, but can’t help bragging (and even though Norwegian salmon is tops too)
;-)
Warsaw was extremely bland imo, even Bratislava's old town was cuter than it
Not as big, but Lviv was the most boring
Didn't think it was too pretty either
Imo Kiev is the best parts of both those cities, so I loved it and can't wait to go back one day
Seriously, the Parisian restaurant prices you quoted are on par or still cheaper than the price you see at casual restaurants that are labelled “$$” on an “$$$$” scale here in New Zealand
Order a rump steak (cheapest cut) with a potato fries and a side vegetable included, plus a glass of wine, sets you at $45
Plus $5 to 8 if the steak is sirloin/porterhouse
This price will be $60 for rump or $65 for sirloin paired with red wine if eating at finer dining restaurants
I have been to a moderately popular (for foreigners) good Parisian bistro at the 12th arrondissement just off Gare de Lyon (À la biche au bois) - the prices are comparable to mid ranged restaurants in New Zealand
In New Zealand happy hours you can get NZ$8 beers during happy hour times
Otherwise be ready to shave NZ$10-12 “normally”...
When I was at school the whole Middle Ages was reduced into a generic bloc and learned about the feudal system, the Crusades, warfare in the Middle Ages, and the Mongol Empire (as preclude to the explorations chapter)
I had no idea about the specific states, much of that cane from self reading encyclopaedias
It depends, I know a friend who is a professional in her job (her job requires university degree and licensing) she doesn’t use much English on social media and certainly is less comfortable with using English than her husband, who also has university degree and working in social media (so strictly speaking not needing professional licensing like the wife does)
And the husband definitely speaks better English because his day job requires him to use English more than German
But then knowing English is one thing, being able to converse fluently and feeling comfortable with using it is another
Both the husband and wife are in late 20s.
That makes sense, thanks
I hope this doesn't offend anyone from this country, but whenever I happen to smell a combination of rain and cigarettes, I'm instantly brought back to my time studying abroad in Finland
I have no idea why, because the odds that I'm both out in the rain *and* passing by cigarette smoke at the same time is extremely small
But it's happened, and when it does it just reminds me of Helsinki
It's a good smell tho
I think the usage must have diverged somewhere in time
I was taught some writing conventions growing up in Hong Kong (date format on letterhead is like 21st September, 2020
But after coming to New Zealand even the most formal letters written here, with the current convention in place since the mid 1990s, will have dates written in the format of [21 September 2020] rather than [21st September, 2020
But this would still be far far too informal in Southeast Asia today (and unacceptable)
Not European myself
I like the locally roasted beans from some of the bigger cafes, like the Addington Coffee Co-op (Christchurch), Unknown Chapter (also Christchurch), or Flight Coffee (Wellington)
Bigger brands would
Be Grinders from Australia (the one used by Qantas)
In general I don’t drink coffee too often, so it is cheaper to pay one to two cups at most at cafes each week (I can use coffee machines at work so I don’t buy coffees during the week)
Do Italian cafes roast their own beans
Most bigger New Zealand cafes seem to have their own roasteries
Those that use beans roasted elsewhere often seem to be lesser in quality
I’m studying towards level B1 (CEFR standard) at French, and I have come across all 3 you mentioned, and y is also a form of pronoun if needed referring to objects related to the subject through à . (from my course notes it is called adverbial pronouns for grammar geeks)
Like  “I get to Auckland
”, « J’arrive à Auckland
» can be shortened to « J’y arrive ».
Fun fact: Cantonese speakers from Hong Kong (like me) would at times say “actually” far too often when speaking in English, because the translated “actually”, “in fact” etc are used as common conjunctions a lot more frequently than their equivalents in English
Cantonese speakers make this mistake too, because Cantonese requires inserting the equivalent of “to be” before “agree”.
Our French teachers at Alliance Française would mark us wrong in DELF exams though if we wrote « ça a fait du sens » . I’ve done A2 exams ...
Our French teachers mentioned that this is often said by English speakers and not as natural as « faire une photo »
I personally like that, although I believe in New Zealand English it is now more common to treat collective nouns as singular, like “the Police has appealed to the public for information”.
TIL: that lots of places in Europe have ID cards, We dont here in NZ
If you want to travel overseas you need a passport obviously or if you want to drive you need a drivers licence but we dont have a ID card as such
The Greek ID cards also have parents' names, with the father's name written in both Greek and Latin characters
Is it a requirement to put a parent's name on forms sometimes in Spain
Even as an adult I had to put my father's name on a car hire agreement on Greece
(I'm not Greek, didn't live there and no other info was requested of him so it was entirely useless info)
A good book to read is Germany: Memories of a Nation by Neil MacGregor
In chapter 1 MacGregor mentioned Prague and Charles University was at one point one of the epicentre of what we understand to be “German” culture today
I take that Prague was one of the most important culturally German city
Are all the parks administered by the local borough councils or the equivalent of the city council
This would have been the case in New Zealand like in Auckland or Christchurch, that no one outside the council or history geeks would care much for the different ownership structures of different parks
I think the OED (Oxford English Dictionary), the Merriam-Webster [dictionary], and the Chicago Manual of Style are the de facto authorities on English
At least for those who have studied at university level
I know this is about Europe but since this just happened a few days ago, I saw a guy park a car with French EU license plates in New Zealand
It was really weird, not only because we're closed off to tourism still, but also because I was nowhere near a big city, or even a medium one
I was in a really small town that does have some tourist appeal, but even if we could have tourists it would be the off-season
What would be the best bigger sized coffee that you can sit down, sip for 15-20 minutes, and relax at a cafe in Italy
I tend to order a long macchiato because you can finish an espresso in one minute
Thanks
The English-language textbooks used in the ESL courses still taught that “the UK 1 billion is 1,000,000 of 1 million, while the US 1 billion is 1,000 million” as late as the late 1990s. Of course students were taught the obsolete UK definition at school then found that the media and workplace use the short scale
Island nations: Am I a joke to you
Ah, so that's your secret
I've always liked your shape too
Chile is great, reminds me of a chili
It's true, you are the only boot
Locally the story is that the north island of NZ is a large dead fish (the tail is at the top)
Alright then
Guess we'll partition ourselves so we play by the rules
Sorry to butt in here, was that the same Charles V that ruled both the Austrian and Spanish Habsburg thrones, and who sacked Rome
It's aspirational
We had them here in New Zealand last year
They formed part of supermarket campaign where you only got them by collecting enough stamps at the supermarket each time you made a purchase
(i.e. you can’t buy them off the shelf at all)
I thought they were Swiss
Growing up it was a weird upper-middle-class interesting gadget that is nice to own (in Asia)
In New Zealand even the really wealthy homes don’t have them
It is called waste disposal units here in New Zealand
It is almost everywhere in New Zealand too (and I suspect also Australia but my Australian-based sibling and their family don’t have it)
Omg yes
And this is a perfect response to OP's question
It's grammatically correct, but archaic to use it as a standard tense
Native speakers do this too, with "Okay, so" or worse, just "So
" which I find  hellish because for some reason my brain is always tricked into trying to find a causal link between what follows and the previous sentence
"Please do what is needed".
"Kindly" was originally a courtesy word meaning "good natured", but in many forms of English (eg US, UK) it is usually only used as an admonition these days
"Needful" is an outdated (in British English) word meaning things that are necessary
The author Stephen King has a book about a haunted shop called Needful Things
That's so funny, over here saying "I'm going to the ocean" meaning the beach rather than, say, 3km out at sea, would be wildly poetic
No one says "shore" either, it would be "coast". "Seaside" just sounds British or like you're talking to children
That doesn't work
As soon as you replace "trouble" with "problem" you can see why:
"We are having problem with this".
If you are sending it to /u/bunnyechoes, please may I have a look as well
I would love to know exactly how you fixed that
Yeah, it's interesting
A number of differences between the varieties of first-language English are remnants from British English as it was spoken at the time of colonization, too
Eg the US "fall" for autumn, or the NZ "lollies" for sweets - neither evolved, they're just antiquated terms that were passed down intact
Oh I see, you're talking about concrete versus abstract nouns
In my experience, non-native speakers are more likely to run into this with specific singular nouns that *don't* require articles, eg "I come from the New York", but for confusion about abstract or uncountable nouns your rule makes sense
Thanks
I really love stuff like this
Your version is very deft
If the military in the 1930s took de Gaulle‘s opinions, and also if they started a strong war instead of Munich
For me the key is if Stambolić not trusted in  Milošević too much, or he were unable to unseat Stambolić. I think that Yogoslavia might survive as a loose confederation or even devolved peacefully into a Yogoslav Commonwealth like the Valvet Divorce had Stambolić stayed
In South Africa we drive on the left and we also use the left side of hallways
Public footpaths are kind of different to busy institutional corridors though
A fairer comparison would be thoroughfares such as underground escalators and airport travellators etc and it seems to me the Brits do have a clear sense of "side" on those
It says New Zealand because I’m actually from there but I’ve got dual nationality and am currently in Africa
Haha
Or touched very lightly and persistently with the corner of a shopping bag by someone who keeps darting angry glances at you
^This ^may ^have ^^happened ^^to ^^me
I remember reading up on news coming out of France from major media that early on during the first wave of teh epidemic, there were attempts by some shops to price gouge hand sanitser (gel hydroalcoolique) and the council of ministers issued a decree setting the maximum price allowable
If hand sanitiser were treated like that, that would presumably apply to masks too
(Also I read that at the early stages of the epidemic you needed a doctor’s prescription to purchase masks in France)
We had a shortage of masks over the counter too in New Zealand
We never needed a GP’s prescription but it was simply unavailable for purchase for a very long time
I enquired at a number of pharmacies around the 3rd week in February and all said that they were sold out
One then put me on a waiting list
It took me two months later for the order to arrive
And even then it was on a ration: I was allowed to purchase only 5
It wasn’t until the end of May at the end of the first lockdown that we could buy as many/little as needed
> Respect for the law
Ah yes, I will never forget being given directions that included: "then you will see a fence with big signs that say Zakaz Wstępu
What you must do is climb under the fence
A local Christchurch Italian restaurant introduced me to bergamotto and chinotto (they are like orange scented liqueurs)
I like chinotto almost as much as limoncello
I like Calvados, it has the apple taste in it
For me I like some mint flavoured liqueurs, does Get27 count as a liqueur
And also don’t forget Cointreau and Grand Marnier too
For people who are over 55 in Hong Kong it is French cognac (XO is considered the minimal standard, I know some wealthier people have Louis XIII as treasures at home)
The younger people are into wine so not so much
I almost misread it as Steinlager
;-) Steinlager is one of the biggest beer brands from New Zealand
And so is/was Hong Kong
People over 55 grew up with French spirits = cognac
> Black dudes offering you bracelets or stuff
There used to be a bunch of those in Paris, I think they were Italians
As soon as I saw the bracelets I was like hell no keep away so they just laughed and didn't bother me
No one in their right mind would travel to the US without full travel insurance though
Tell us some actual scams to be wary of
I don't get why anyone would *not* get the tube
Oh ok
As soon as you look at a transport map the tube seems like the obvious winner to me
But yeah tourist traps take many forms
Savages
I don't know how people can live like that
Kiwi with Asian backgrounds
99% of octopus served at Japanese restaurants would be octopus tentacles cooked (boiled) then thinly sliced and served with soy sauce and wasabi
Kiwi with Asian background (born in HK)
Native kiwis don’t specifically eat octopus although fried squid rings are a staple at fish and chips places
But octopus is super common at Mediterranean restaurants
Asian wise, the Japanese eat boiled octopus tentacles thinly sliced, served like sashimi but it is cooked
The only seasonings are soy sauce and wasabi
Or they will simply become pests in the new country without becoming drop bears
Winking at possums and what happened when they migrated across the Tasman to New Zealand
;-)
(PS: I love koalas but know that introducing them to the wild areas outside their native country can produce unintended consequences)
From New Zealand: like to think the Sunday roasts and bangers and mashes, fish and chips, trifles, every traditional
British dish tastes better in New Zealand than in the UK
Maybe it is fresher ingredients, and restaurants are more honest and not taking shortcuts
You’ll love Chinese then
;-)
Brothers: there is a separate word between a brother that is older than you, and one younger than you
Sister: same, there are different words for a sister older than you and younger
Grandfather and grandmother: there are different ones depending if the grandfather and grandmother are from your Dad’s side or Mum’s.
Uncles and aunts: different terms apply to the uncle and aunt if the are siblings of Dad or Mum
And then there are different terms whether they are older siblings than your parents or younger
(An exception is an uncle who is a sibling of your Mum - same term regardless whether he is older than your mother or not)
Oh, the uncle or aunt that is related by marriage ie the spouse of the one related to your parents, have names that say the “husband/wife of uncle/aunt —-“
Nephew/niece: yes they have different names depending whether they are your brother’s children, or sister’s.
Cousins: there are separate different terms if they are from male uncles from your father’s brothers
The cousins from your Dad’s sister’s children, and cousins from your Mum’s brothers or sisters, all share a second system of cousins titles
Who says Chinese family relation names are easy (!)
I found Lyon tourist offices, shops, and restaurants staff and passers by are pleasant people
Public Transport ticketing people on the other hand, at least the one I came across on my trip in 2015, was nasty rude - like the stereotype French officials
I have an ex-boss who is Scottish migrant from near Glasgow but called him Glaswegian
His accent was extremely thick coupled with he spoke very fast too
I know people from Edinburgh and they sound a lot easier to understand than my ex-boss LOL
Yeah we wear these poppies here in NZ
Australia does it and so does most of the commonwealth (I think, correct me if I am wrong)
As a kiwi, I think of the poppy as an ANZAC tradition, not a British one
I guess that we have a different day we wear poppies helps that impression
I've seen the occasional Aussie sports presenter wearing a sprig of rosemary as well
Czechovia sounds cool, but I'm just so used to Czech Republic though that any other just doesn't sound right
even though Czechia (or an anglicised version like Czeska) makes so much more sense
Also, Nike released a shoe called "The Black and Tan" around St Patricks day
But when I read the international news section about tornados it is always somewhere in the US
Or maybe Marie Curie
She and Chopin are the two Polish figures that I recognise as Polish (as an ignorant foreigner I haven’t read about many Polish people)
Are they serious
Because we have the Ban 1080 Party which is a serious party who want to stop our Department of Conservation from poisoning rats etc
TIL
This is so bizarre
Me too, Strasbourg (and Alsace in general) is a place where it is not too touristy (in general Alsace has tourists, but it’s definitely no Paris, Provence, Chambord, Mont St Michels)
People don’t have that tourism fatigue mood that you see in Paris, or preparing to rip you off mode you often encounter in PACA
I vote Leipzig too
If you want to find out more about the 1989 Revolution and GDR state terrors and resistance movement, Leipzig (along with Berlin, and one town in Saxony where it housed a maximum security prison for political prisoners - have forgotten the name of the former prison) is the place to visit
If you are into music, Leipzig is a must too
It has an easy popular vibe when Berlin is becoming a bit commercialised
Yep I think that’s the one
Thanks for the reminder
There was a guy in my highschool class that was being a di*k to me
I was a naive recent migrant from Asia then and got to that scholars-oriented class recently
He insisted I add “please” in all my questions and requests for help, in a very condescending way
All round unpleasant guy to me
In New Zealand we use eggplant and courgette (but someone I know sells at the farmer’s market and she used zucchini)
How about in business
I always start with “Good morning, this is [full name first followed by last name] speaking at [full name of the business]”. Thanks
I have just noticed almost very few mention their last names when they are answering business calls - unlike when they are making business calls and they are saying they are whom
I prefer stating my full name just to make it absolutely clear
Lisboa is well known in East and SE Asia for being the name of the late Stanley Ho’s flagship casino and hotel complex in Macau
There’s also a new Hotel Lisboa
From what I read the Polish pronunciation would be very different from attempting to pronounce them by reading them using the closest-looking English letters
Like Lodz, Wroclaw what I heard are nothing like “lots”, “Wow-claw”. An I right on this
Thanks
The
You have the French equivalents as well, which gave an yet entirely different set of spellings
As I’m learning French occasionally I manage to mingle by remembering the French names for the Italian city or region (!)
Roma - Rome (Eng) - Rome (Fr)
Palermo - Palermo (Eng) - Palerme (Fr)
Genova - Genoa (Eng) - Gênes (Fr)
Bolonga - Bolonga (Eng) - Bologne (Fr)
When I visited Marseille in 2014, the French tour guide told me t city was founded by Greeks do it was Greek at the very beginning
Non European here
You can imagine rugby is the national sport or even religion in Aotearoa
No other sport matters except for cricket and netball
It practically is the most popular sport down under with the next being cricket or football
I had read somewhere that WWI killed the sport’s popularity
Without that rugby could be Germany’s no
2 sport today
Hey we got 3 world cups first bro
Wow, I’m jealous, I never seen a match at Eden Park yet
Was it ABs
One of the things you overhear at work is you will meet someone who is one of the 4:
- they play rugby on weekends
- they are referees at rugby matches
- they have to take their children to school sports on weekends, likely to be rugby
- their family or one school friend is an ex-All Black
I happen to have all 4 even as an immigrant
Wait what
are they sold in the supermarket refrigerated
I never noticed when I have been over in Aussie
Here they are sold on the shelves and you can just leave them out
well Its probably a 50/50 thing some leave them out others chuck them in the fridge
Well TIL  yeah like I said the Eggs here are sold out on the shelves but all fridges have the bracket thingys for holding  them in the fridge
I have always left them out but I get through dozen in a week so never needed to keep them longer
to be fair, your country has a history of lying to the Irish ;)
It is considered weird here as well
But fuck them I always go alone
As someone with Asian skin and lived in Asia until my teenage years, I had better reception in Paris than Sydney ironically
(Not saying Sydney is any bad, but I found the average shop people less rude in Paris than Sydney, and also Paris has less yobbos/bogans yelling at you on “ching ch*** china***” which could happen out of random at some places in Sydney (or Auckland or Christchurch for that matter) very occasionally
Not all Aussies are bogan racists (and I have met nice bogans) but often enough that even a casual tourists can encounter at a reasonably hot spot like Manly at 4 pm on a weekend
Before I went to Paris for the first time, I was led to believe Parisians were cold nasty rude people, but I found it was OK and rather pleasant at the end
People were helpful even when they were rushing to business, they coped with my limited French
Starting from a position of low expectations can have its benefits
In New Zealand you can buy certain classes of over the counter medications at the supermarket, but not all
There are some that you still have to go to pharmacies to buy
And certainly for prescription items it has to be pharmacies
Wow, I was with you up until your example
So it's completely fine for the Pole in your example to feel uncomfortable around Muslims (based on racist generalisations thinking all Muslims are bad), but the second they are called out on that, they're the victims of racism and you defend them
I'm sure there are legitimate situations of anti-Polish sentiment in Germany, but that's definitely not a situation where people need to feel sympathy for the "victim".
The Soviet Union was one of the major supporters of Algeria during the FLN era
South Islanders
Interesting, I've never heard anyone pronounce it like that in real life, only on some British TV and that's still rare
My own anecdotal experience is pronouncing it normally, but if you can't then you say it like "sikst" or simply  "sikssss" with a longer emphasis on the s.
I know pubs in New Zealand used to close at 6 pm by law until 1967
It was intended to limit drinking but it achieved the opposite - men would go to the pubs after work, from 5 pm and then drink as much as they could until the closing time - it was callef “6 o’clock swill”. People would be drunk and fights would break out often and everyone were on the street at 6 pm
It seems that licensing, law, can create habits
Pubs in New Zealand used to have to close at 6 pm by law until 1967
Males would finish work at 5 then make a run to the pub and drink as much as they could before the pubs closed at 6 - “the 6 o’clock swill”. When they were out on the streets fights would break out
It sounded similar to what you describe
From my experience Edinburgh is just like familiar if you have been to Dunedin before
And in general I agree, I find Scotland to be similar to NZ - there is a love for home baking that got inherited throughout NZ
I mentioned on another comment to, too me the people who enjoy this film the most would be the ones who have had a relatable experience of living (studying or working ) overseas: maybe exchange students or people who had done working holidays overseas, expats on foreign job postings, or are immigrants themselves
I found this film (plus the other two of the trilogy) are particularly enjoyable if you have ever lived in a foreign country or moved to another country: it may be a student exchange, studying overseas, expat on assignment, OE (overseas experience), or immigrant
Maybe the person watching it is able to relate personally what the main character had gone through
I find this sub really chill in general, though
I have a semi off topic question: can anyone recommend the most popular Polish sausage types
I have rd Wikipedia and they seem to be very brief
I’m keen to learn more about them
Thanks
I’m in New Zealand
No as far as I know we don’t have Polish shops other than European shops that stock some Polish food too
I have seen Polish shops in Melbourne Australia - there is a sausage place at the Queen Victoria Market that I believe is Polish, the Monarch Cake Shop in St Kildas is Polish
I’m not European myself, but I agree
Germany has played a big part in shaping what Europe and even the world looks today, and how the world functions
Back in the 1950s Hungary was a world power in football
I think by the time Louis XVI acceded to the throne, it was already too late
Some of the blame lay on the king himself who was too weak-willed to see through the tough reforms, and not doing things then ditched them when it became painful
I guess if his father brought him up to have his own mind, and he could use people like Necker more wisely, and make concessions to the people early enough he wouldn't have lost his head
If I were French I would love to spend the time between the Tennis Court Oath and Bastille was stormed, or during the Reign of Terror
Garibaldi's tales are stuff of legends for historians
I think armchair historians will find them entertaining too from a lighthearted perspective
Thanks, I thought Louis XVI was dragged along kicking and screaming when he agreed to reforms
His grandfather Louis XV’s role was also decisive though - many historians lay the blame on him for sowing the seeds of the root causes of the French Revolution with his neglect of rules and failures on foreign and domestic policies
Is this a fair assessment
Grew up in Hong Kong: at primary school level with Chinese-language schooling, the continent with Australia and New Zealand is called Oceania, in line with Taiwan, Japan, Europe, and the US
Got to secondary school and teaching language medium switched to English: suddenly it is Australasia for Australia, New Zealand, and the South Pacific Islands in line with the British namings
Then came to New Zealand for high school: Australasia
No native-born Kiwis use the term Oceania
New Zealand: the late Prime Minister Sir Robert Muldoon (PM from 1975 to 1984) once responded to journalists questions about New Zealanders leaving NZ for Australia in droves when he was hosting his Australian counterpart Malcolm Fraser
His retort was:
“'New Zealanders who leave for Australia raise the IQ of both countries
Hong Kong: the former Director of Health Margaret Chan Fung Fu-chun (she eventually became the Director of the WHO, and succeeded by, yes, Tedros Adhanom) during the Avian flu outbreak in 1997 said, “I eat chicken everyday”
Didn’t Chirac eventually become the president and succeeding Mitterand, but not until the next election in 1995
One additional thing I know (I have Asian connections growing up) is never, never rinse/steep cooked pasta in cold running water
It’s not Asian noodles
You need to rinse the Asian noodles to give you the full spring-y chewable textures and avoid the strands sticking with each other , but for pasta rinsing it washes away all the starch you can potentially use for helping the sauce coat on the pasta evenly
Strange, I thought it is common sense to wait for the water to boil first, before you put the pasta into the pot
I grew up in a non-English-speaking environment
When I was growing up overseas (in East Asia, and the school system was rote-learning type) at around 8 or 9, we always had 5 minutes of spelling tests from our teacher every day that tested the spelling of prescribed list of words from the day before
If we didn't get it right we would be punished with either extra homework such as writing these words for 100 times, or detention at school intervals
This is on top of dictation tests that we got weekly which also tested our spellings
Again getting under 60%, we would get detention after school hours
Wonders of primary education in true spoon feeding style
The positive was I received my foundations in mathematical skills through those hard work and tears
But English, many people were scarred for life from these lessons
Can any Germans help
I always read about Prussian stereotype as sticker of rules, punctual, not much humour, conservative Junkers
Which parts of Germany can you still find them
I know someone from Germany in my French class at AF here in New Zealand, and she is nothing like the stereotype Prussian even though her hometown is part of the historic centre of Prussia
Thanks
I sometimes imagine Thuringia had lots of Nazi supporters because even before Hitler became the Chancellor the Nazis had one of the highest shares of votes anywhere in Germany during the Weimar Republic
Is it still true or just reading too much into history
Thanks
This is very common for hipsters of my parents generation here in New Zealand, especially back in the 1980s-1990s before they could buy home espresso machines
I have always wondered what that thing was
Hmm insinkerators are something some people have here in New Zealand
Particularly kitchens furnished after 2000s, but I first saw one here in the 1980s.
They're falling out of fashion now though because of environmental consciousness and compost
Plenty of houses I've stayed in have signs warning you not to put food down the insinkerator
I am thinking of getting one of those
We also have the [multi kai cooker] for making Maori-style hangi food
Socket protectors are [common here] too, but ours are flimsier than yours
Imagine plumbing, electricity, and telecommunications (first copper phone lines, now fibre) had to be retrofitted inside your house
It must be a tricky job for plumbers, electricians, and telco technicians
Was the Ruhr region already inhabited or developed prior to the Industrial Revolution
I have a feeling they might have been founded from scratch in the 19th century, and before that it was nothing but farmlands
Thanks
Come to New Zealand
Even France felt like wide open networks of motorways to me
Provence also feels way more like Italy than Paris to me when I went there in 2014
I was feeling as if I were already half way to Italy in the Luberon and Avignon, Marseille, Cassis, Nîmes
I would have to worry how I as a Kiwi can afford a holiday in Switzerland
It sounds like the costs for doing stuff is 2-3 times as back in NZ
London is similar too
My mother too, our mothers must have very long arms
I have an East Asian family background and struggle to think of potatoes as a sweet dish (!)
Sweet potatoes yes, but not potatoes
To my mind any dish with potato is a savoury dish
I would have believed it if it were made with wheat flour
There are glutinous rice flour made dumplings that are filled with sugar or adzuki bean paste
Other than that, I don’t know any homemade desserts in NZ (for non-Asians) that are of the dumping varieties
Steamed fruit pudding (although I don’t think I have heard apricot pudding, it is usually sticky date or raisin pudding) or pavlova are more the European-background New Zealanders’ home dessert experience
The
You have baked cake, but not normally considered as desserts, but as a morning tea or afternoon treat
Potatoes used in dessert (!)
I stayed in Chernobyl for a few days in 2017
It was awesome and I highly recommend it
It was definitely overrun with trees, I didn't expect it to be so foresty and green
I was expecting more of an urban wasteland, but it's like a forest with some random derelict buildings
Lots of wild dogs though only had one aggressively try to play with our group, other than that there weren't any other animals I noticed
Radiation was manageable and we got a touristy certificate showing us how much radiation we received during our stay - though it was made really clear to us that there's still heaps of places with deadly levels of radiation which is why it's illegal to wander off, as if any of us wanted to do that lol
I wasnt aware of anything happening at Chernobyl though, I'll have to look up to see what accident this was
There are a few words in English that the h is a silent letter too: honour/honours is one, and loanwords from French like l’hôpital’s Rule in Calculus
The American pronunciation of herbs also doesn’t sound the h either
Not at all
In Australia the AFP (Australian Federal Police) can police in the same area as the state or territory police, for example in Melbourne (Victoria) there you can have the AFP and Victoria Police
In that instance Victoria Police is the police force to go to if you have regular crimes like theft, murder, traffic accident, but the AFP investigates federal/Commonwealth crimes (crimes against the Commonwealth [of Australia] government) such as terrorism, people smuggling, human trafficking, aircraft, airport and aviation crimes
Do they have similar distinction in Germany like they do in Australia
Thanks
I thought the German Federal Police is in general the people that look at your passport at the airport
James the first and sixth didn't unite England and Scotland
He became king of both countries, but they were still separate countries until the treaty of union occurred, about a hundred years later
Hmm
We don't really eat dumplings
Closest thing I can think of for New Zealand would be a [sausage roll
How do you guys see China under Mao Zedong and in particular the Cultural Revolution
I was born in HK with family heritage on the KMT side that fled the Communists
I read and heard a lot of brutal stuff around the Anti-Rughtist movement, Great Leap Forward followed by famine in 1960-1963 where 40 million died, and the Cultural Revolution where many “enemies of the working and peasant class” were humiliated to suicide, and in Guangxi they even went as far and  murdered the now penniless descendants land-owning class and even engaging in cannibalism - eating them literally
Did it get reported in the Eastern bloc
Eden Hazard('s fine ass)
I had walked by myself through the Chatelet station close to midnight on my first trip to Paris
When I told the experience to a local guide on the following trip to Paris he thought I was brave (or more likely reckless plus lucky ;-)) Looking back it was an invitation for being mugged (relatively well dressed East Asian looking guy, obviously tourist, unaccompanied and alone, at close to midnight, at the most dangerous station in Paris)
Strange for me, to me the accordion reminds me of Switzerland and northern Italy (the Milan part) first, followed by France
In East Asia it is often seen in period drama set in pre-Communist China especially 1930s Shanghai, or set in the Mao Zedong-era People’s Rep of China
Popular among the left-leaning/Communist sympathisers artists, less so among the non-leftist/anti-Communists
I have been to Paris twice and spent 8 days in total
It is just long enough to have covered the major arrondissements and half of the major museums plus Versailles
I can easily spend another week only to cover all the major sights
Paris is a place that if you go there expecting the worst, it can pleasantly surprise you
Yea Its easy to feel drowned out on the internet by American opinions and point of views
It was in 1603 when King James VI of Scotland succeeded to the English throne and ruled as James I, right when Queen Elizabeth I died
I have family living in the suburbs of Brisbane around Wishart
When I was walking down streets there it feels way more like the US than anywhere in New Zealand
Another family member who lives in the US said if not for driving on the other side the looks of Wishart could just have been suburban Pennsylvania or Michigan
And I have also walked around suburbs in Melbourne, and again they look far more like North America than suburbs i. New Zealand
I was sorely disappointed when I walked out of Prague hlavní nádrazí and the Czechhunter man didn't walk up to me :(
We inherited it as well - I remember once when I was a kid, some German tourists I was taking a picture for started doing peace signs, but 90% of them were what we call "doing the fingers" and I was really shocked
I like the chocolate ganache tart, but this is so fattening so I can’t eat it every day
Another French pastry I like is the fresh fruit tart: with shortcrust pastry, added pastry cream and topped with fresh fruit
About “proper” desserts, to me I like creme caramel or chocolate mousse
And if I can get a dense chocolate ganache-like log dessert I will be happy

That's a British phrase
The American equivalent is probably [Pollyanna]
Goody Two Shoes is  a [character from the 17th century]
"Goody" has nothing to do with being good, it used to be a common form of address, like "Miss".
It originally meant Miss Wealthy - the American equivalent is how they say "look at Mr Money Bags over here" - but then after the kids book about some kid called that, it became a sarcastic reference to the character
I asked over at AskAnAmerican about this a couple of years ago and it sounds like while most of the middle class don't, the poor Americans still do a lot of stuff with cheques, and even have this thing called a "Check Cashing Service". [thread]

Did I read that right, every student must reach Calculus level maths before graduating high school in Italy
TIL I'd be a high school drop out of I were were Italian
California, we don't have specific requirements like that here
Of course, unofficially colleges want you to reach X level in math or X level in science which is what most students go by and which is why most do end up with Calc AB/BC
At least with my school district, you just needed to pass 4 years of math
But it's just a me thing, since math was my absolute worst subject, I only made it to Algebra 2 after 4 years
Of course it was enough to graduate but probably why I didn't end up at an Ivy League or a UC lol
Whoever could shove the most salt into their skin with an ice cube without showing emotion would win 'the game'.
I’ve heard of Uppsala only because the university is so frequently cited in academic literature
Both Turin and Bologna (along with kaybe Naples) are very well known among people who are foodies
These 3 are virtually at the top of food tourism
(I don’t know why, but Tuscany doesn’t seem to share this honour for being known for its cuisine)
Even Brisbane or the Gold Coast are not known
I know with Hong Kong and Kiwi connection, I’m cheating here :-p
Is Slovenia de facto like a city-state (city-states like Singapore for example)
I know Aberdeen: I grew up in Hong Kong and a suburb/district in Hong Kong is named Aberdeen after the Scottish city
Hong Komg’s Aberdeen was a fisheries shelter in the 19th century to the first half of the 20th
Are they different cities
It would have long ago been considered the same city effectively (in people’s minds) if it were in New Zealand or Australia
I know Bath, Chris Patten was the MP there before he went/came to Hong Kong to become the last [British] Hong Kong Governor
I think you’re correct here
I don’t know any example in Australia (other than Brisbane and the Gold Coast are fast becoming a single urban area soon)
In New Zealand’s case Auckland was founded with around 30 of small towns/shires/cities, then consolidated into 4 in 1989, and one in 2010
But they were not German cities that grew over time, it was more like small villages got swallowed up by Auckland city as it grew bigger
Nothing like Germany where they were clearly cities then grew and grew and got into one blob
In my school German classes more than 25 years ago a part of the term exam required us to put the names of German cities on the map
I struggled to remember where Hanover was, and always wondered why the English-speaking world, not just NZ, seems to spend so much energy on knowing Hanover
Then I learned about the Act of Settlement 1701, King George I, etc
I guess it had to do with they were founded when the original 13 States were still British colonies in the 18th Century
The period corresponded to when the House of Hanover became the British monarchs (early to mid 18th Century, roughly around King George I and II’s reigns)
New Zealand but born and grew up a Hong Konger kid
Can second what you said
Also in my age bracket I was in between the group where they had senior highschool or uni students or even teachers-in-training doing one on one tutoring, and people going to cram schools
I think this change happened in the 90s.
New Zealand: I left Hong Kong at F.2 and started 3rd Form in NZ, here you only go to cram schools if you are (1st generation) Asian in ethnicity
The second generation New Zealand-born English-speaking Asian New Zealanders have weekend ancestral-language (like Chinese) classes but no cram school
My nephew is American who started university, and what I think is applying to enrol at some American universities are more like applying for a job - they don’t want bookworms who are good only at exams but not well rounded thinkers
So many unis have their own individualities, some are intellectual, and some want their students to be all rounders
Number two is to sift out those who are only good at rote learning
These observations are backed up by the Dad of the nephew (my brother), who also studied in the US for university and postgraduate degrees
Eating non-chicken poultry such as ducks, goose, quails, pigeons: is it common in your country’s traditional cuisine, or common in what you actually eat at restaurants nowadays
Coming from New Zealand poultry other than chicken are not that common at all
Ducks are considered game birds traditionally in New Zealand: any ducks on the table are usually results of hunting during duck shooting seasons from around May to August
The only exceptions would be the Asian background Kiwis (like me) where eating ducks is just as common as chicken
Goose and quails are unheard of, let alone pigeons
How about your country’s traditional food or what’s actually popular (say, Chinese restaurants)
Do you get to eat ducks, goose, quails, pigeons
In your traditional cuisine or at ethnic restaurants
As a fellow New Zealander, I’m really baffled by your claim that poultry other than chicken isn’t common
I’m Pākeha and have found that turkey and duck is very common, both in home cooking and at restaurants
I’m definitely sure the duck is very uncommon in home cooking, any news articles about eating duck seems to be from duck shooting season
It may be more common at restaurants, but again most restaurants menu don’t do it here in Christchurch, and confit duck is not that popular dish these days
Turkey: I stand corrected
it is extremely rare to find turkey labelled as turkey meat available for sale outside the Christmas holiday season
Most turkey eaten on a daily basis is made into sausages or smoked sandwich fillings
Roast goose is also done in Hong Kong in the Chinese roast dick way
Roast Goose costs usually 1
5x - 2x of roast duck, but it is not so expensive such that they aren’t eaten outside the festive seasons
People eat roast duck fairly regularly, roast goose too but less often than duck
Interesting
I was born in Hong Kong and over there chicken, duck, goose, pigeon, quails (and turkey) are common and considered “normal” poultry meat
Others are definitely games - and I have never eaten these “other” birds
Compared with NZ the poultry lost is definitely much wider
I’ve heard about duck rice - know that some people from Hong Kong go to Macau specifically for Portuguese/Macanese food
Duck rice is one of the dishes they go having: [duck rice]
I heard about Portuguese duck rice
I grew up in Hong Kong and read about restaurants in Macau serving Portuguese style duck rice
And we'll make the ocean pay for it

Just a further note both Sandvik and Altas are huge in the mining industry as well  both make tons of stuff for underground mining like drills,Loaders and trucks
My site almost using everything Sandvik
Also surface mining as well
The underground drill I operate is Sandvik . And the drills they make are probably the most popular world wide
I think ThyssenKrupp are known if you are a history geek (reading about the rise of Nazis), or you spend a lot of time investigating the lift/elevator or escalators at your office building or the shopping mall
I vote A. Eberle
You will know this if you work in the electricity industry
Yeah true I never thought of that
The drills are made in Finland maybe tamrock was originally a Finnish company
. The loaders and trucks are Swedish though I think
Majority of the consumables I use on the drill seem to be Swedish though
And yeah I would not be surprised  if they control 95% of the market for drills between them
Although I have never operated any epiroc drills myself
Every country in the world includes the history of ancient Greece particularly Athens in their school history class curriculum at some stage
This tells us how important Athens is to the whole world (yes, even China, Taiwan, India, Egypt, Japan, or Mexico, or Saudi Arabia study ancient Greece’s history)
I have two German friends (they are boyfriend-girlfriend couple) who are from the Black Forest region, Tübingen specifically, and they definitely look down on Berlin when I was asking them about things I experienced when in Berlin
I always thought Thuringia (Thüringen) and Hesse (Hessen) would be about as German heartland as you get when I read up on German history, folklores
It is strange that they don’t attract as much attention overseas, and very few overseas tourists
Oh I forgot Frankfurt is in Hesse
Thanks
Definitely
If I had to be ruled by one of them I would much rather Vlad than Ceausescu

No, they had a private army and managed to control parts of it (other countries as well) with local allies as official rulers, but they were never considered to "own" it
Tulips, lots of tall blonde or brunette attractive people (both guys and girls), dairy, chocolate, waffles, fries, down to earth not so hung up on fashion, Belgium: a “Germanic” France, mussels, Luxembourg banks
Hong Kong: I did Emily and the Detectives, Little Women, one play which I had forgotten the name, and Jane Eyre at HK schools
New Zealand: did a story about Maori and Pakeha children, poems by Yeats, Robert Frost, The God Boy by Ian Cross, Romeo and Juilet, Macbeth, Othello, Robert Cormier, William Golding’s Lord of the Flies and The Inheritance, Peter Shaffer’s Equus, plus James K. Baxter’s poems
I’m surprised that Proust isn’t there
Most native English-speaking literature minded people will have heard of Proust’s name even though they know nothing about his works
I like Maurice LeBlanc’s Arsène Lupin series, he is kind of like a French Robin Hood set in France during the pre-WWI Third Republic era
Read the translation into Chinese when I was 9
Also I remember studying translated version of “The Last Class” by Alphonse Daudet in English classes here in New Zealand
I did two short stories by Edmondo De Amicis at school Chinese classes (in Hong Kong when I was 11, just before coming to NZ the following year) - the two stories were taken from Cuore: one was dealing with a child staying up to do his Dad’s works so the family could live a more comfortable life, the other was about a “young patriot” standing up to the Austrian occupier
New Zealand: had done all on your list too, except Of Mice and Men
I read a simplified English graded reader’s version of Emily and the Detectives in secondary school HK
It was Form 1 English
I had always thought it was a native English-language novel until a couple years ago when I found it was a translation from German
I really enjoyed the storyline even though it was close to 30 years ago
I wondered about that too
De Amicis along with Russian, French, Japanese, and German authors entered into pre-Communist Chinese consciousness during the May Fourth movement in 1919
First, these works were some of the first to be translated into “modern vernacular Chinese”, and second, De Amicis’ left-wing background and his Italian patriotism from the Risorgimento  times fitted well into the Chinese nationalist mindset in 1919
Now, how did that piece end up in the end of 20th century Chinese classes in Hong Kong
Hong Kong was settled by scholars and other refugees fleeing the Communists who came to power in mainland China in 1949
They loathed Communism but still inherited some of the nationalist education/upbringing during the May Fourth movement in China in 1919
So they picked some works from like De Amicis plus other authors, that reflected some of the Chinese nationalist mindset but not with the overt left-wing ideology, when they set out the secondary school Chinese syllabus in the 1960s and onwards
So we ended up having the experience of learning De Amicis while the guy is unknown to people in New Zealand and the UK (unless they had done European literature or Italian)
So this is the long story why we learned De Amicis at school in Hong Kong
:-) hope this helps
For me the vinegar doused on chips (thicker fries) or in packets of chips/crisps are usually so tart that the dishes remind me of high school Chemistry experiments
It is high graded malt vinegar and even distilled white vinegar
Some places even make it out of commercial acetic acid [called non-brewed condiment] because they would be halal:
I said on two other threads above that the vinegar is often commercial acetic acid, as it wouldn’t be non/alcoholic (!)
And I agree it is terrible that it reminds me of high school Chemistry experiments
Huh
I have the same zodiac sign as Jesus
Not sure what to do with that knowledge
Bonus answer from New Zealand (don’t shoot me, I know NZ is not Europe but there are so many cultural links with Europe)
KFC is common but only about 3/4 as Maccas here
Also here we have “country fried chicken” on the traditional side, and Japanese karaage and Korean crunchy fried chicken on the globalised cuisine side
I think KFC seems to be in a disadvantaged position: only people from lower socio-economic groups or are “Maori or Pacific Islander backgrounds”, or those who are country lads in rural service towns will be customers
It seems very few white/European middle class in bigger urban cities eat at KFCs (except maybe Hamilton, which has a reputation for boring conventional suburban life), and neither fo Asian Kiwis
It seems the original meaning of KFC has been displaced among most people by KFC = Korean [Inspired] Fried Chicken as I can see in Chch, Wellington, and Auckland
New Zealand (from my experience at school in the 1990s): we don’t really have regional variations in NZ English other than some people roll r’s like American varieties of English down south, and we don’t have different dialects of NZ English
What we studied at school was how New Zealand English developed and how it diverged from standard British English (Received Pronunciation) over time
It is mainly contrasted with standard RP and Cockney English in the UK
We also discussed the impact from Maori
There are minor sections discussing links with Australian English and influences from US English (mainly General American English from media)
But in general we don’t learn about how the Australian and American varieties of English developed and let alone Indian, Irish, Singaporean, Canadian, South African wtc, and British English esp RP is the default frame of reference
That would be Received Pronunciation (RP), the one traditionally used by the Queen and the BBC
This is what I was taught at school in New Zealand during the 1990s.
I think if you go to Noumea the French spoken is the same as in Paris (they may have some vocabularies specific to New Caledonia, but it is the same language as in European parts of France)
And it’s the same in Tahiti - I have been to Tahiti and their French looks the same
From New Zealand cafe fares: “home-made” chicken with avocado sandwich, using wholegrain bread
Ideally toasted
I remember a trip when we spent time in Provence (from Avignon to Gordes/Roussillon  down to Marseilles and Cassis) and Nimes a few years back, and trying to find pan bagnat for lunch there
We didn’t have any luck
Then I went back to New Zealand and found pan bagnat is not provencial food
I would add mustard and that would be my idea of perfection
Mixing obviously sugary sweet with the savoury is unforgivable sin to this Asian-New Zealander too
It is the infinite ways for saying the same
thing using different words (like: died, gone, passed away, left, all meaning something with dying) depending on how formal or how much euphemism you want it
It is also infinitely complex that it can also differ a lot between other countries where English is natively spoken as well
The pattern for Catalan numbers looks very similar to French
(am halfway towards achieving CEFR B1 in French fluency)
The only tight situation I can think of is that in colloquial New Zealand English, "sweet as" (the stress falls on the last word) is a common all-purpose expression meaning "good", "I am happy", "thank you" "you are welcome", "that's okay", "I understand" etc
Because of our accents, a lot of English speakers think New Zealanders are saying "sweet ass" and it can be awkward when we are talking to waiters and such
How old is Zlatan Ibrahimović? He seems to have been on every Swedish selection since the 2000’s, so I thought he must be close to retirement age by now

This just in: Country with effective two party system has two parties that take vast majority of vote share
Sadly our political system is set up to guarantee either Labour or Conservative win
It's a fault of the system and needs changing
The vast majority of constituencies will only ever return Labour or Tory so voting third party just guarantees your vote is ignored

The UK is a constitutional monarchy, as much as I'd love to see democracy flourish, it's unlikely you'll get boris out until the next election, or until the system changes as it's never been democratic
The Queens free to appoint and remove any person she sees fit from any office in parliament
She doesn't enforce her monarchical powers often, although she holds many
Commonwealth government power originates form the Queen stepping back and allowing each commonwealth nation to run their governments as they see fit, within the rights of the commonwealth
Though most nations under the UK run heavily independent of the commonwealth nowadays, although they all have Governor Generals which are high level government officials appointed by the Crown
The Queen also pays her taxes, despite 0 obligations to even pay a tax as the Queen
The Queen can also wage war with Her Majesties royal armed forces
Identity politics only exists because being a minority in our society is an inherently political identity

A lot of people told me you only go to Milan on business if you’re visiting Italy from other countries
For food or visiting historic/worth visiting places head to say Venice, Florence, Tuscany, Rome, Naples, etc
But to me Milan has its beauty too
And I’ve been sold the idea by a guy who runs an Italian deli food/wine place in New Zealand / he and his family are originally from Milan
Yep Christchurch
I’m getting a feeling that you may know the same guy that runs the business

I think he and family have gone back to Milan now, but is still running direct order business in New Zealand

Pig is just Zhū (豬), not Zhu Na, and it isn't even close to being a homophone for China in either English or Chinese
(Zhōngguó 中國, literally 'the Middle Kingdom') It makes no sense for 'Zhu Na' to be used as a slur
[There is a history of homophones for internet slang to get around censorship and vulgarity laws] but I really can't see a way in which this is supposedly offensive
Furthermore, pigs represent wealth, fortune, and prosperity in Chinese culture so it's not even an offensive comparison
They are clearly manipulating the university administration through using language that they know will get the administration jumping to their tune
They are taking advantage of the fact that Chinese culture is opaque to outsiders while they have a clearer first-hand understanding of Western democracy and social values
They know that the university is scared of being accused of racism - or even worse, they might lose the lucrative revenue stream of Chinese international students who pay absurd amounts of money for little pieces of paper that won't even matter since they already have family connections
Nope
It's just total gibberish
There is an old 19th/early 20th century Japanese slur for China called 支那 pronounced like Zhī Nà, but in Chinese 豬 Zhu sounds *nothing* like 支 and as far as I know, there's absolutely no literary or etymological link
Even 支那 itself is super outdated - it's like the equivalent of using 'Hun' or 'Jerry' as a slur for Germans
People just don't use those terms anymore, and out of its context it's just comical now - especially to claim the Li-Pig is a reference to that when it requires big leaps in logic and a pretty intimate knowledge of late Qing/Republican Era Chinese history/culture to even know *why* 支那 was ever offensive
Don’t forget South Ossetia and their genocidal hatred for Georgia
This is a fantastic proposal - the limits of what AI can do needs to be curtailed strongly and carefully for ethical purposes
I’m wondering why, as the Prime Minister of Belgium, he was tweeting this in English, and not in his country’s languages

Dunedin in New Zealand was built and named after Edinburgh
I went to Dunedin some years before making it to Edinburgh
There is enough atmosphere around the old parts of town that recalls bits of Dunedin (not a lot, but definitely there is some that reminded me of Dunedin)
Coincidentally Edinburgh and Dunedin are also sister cities
When I traveled to the Netherlands I could not believe how clean the country side was

I remember visiting Germany in 2015 and I was in Frankfurt on the same day as the 25th anniversary of the German reunification
It was a carnival, and seeing so much of what I read from history books came live
Germany from 1871 to 1945/1989 hadn’t been a happy story
It only changed from 1989
At least it looks a much happier country today
It really isn't, the fall of the Warsaw Pact was because Gorbachev's reforms enabled the explosion of popular disapproval against the totalitarian regimes
In my view anyway
Even if the Soviet military build-up hadn't of happened during the decade I seriously doubt Gorbachev would ever have been comfortable using force to quell the uprising as had happened in 1953
Assuming she'll be PM in 3 years

I just know Darmstadt from reading up the history of the UK royal family and their extensive Saxe-Coburg and Gotha relatives

It reminds me of Avignon and Carcassonne both in France
I have been to Avignon and it’s one of my favourite places, is Cesky Krumlov similar to Avignon and Carcassonne
Question to Italians: is Venice worth going to as a tourist destination
I always thought that if I go to Italy in the future I would spend lots of time in Tuscany (particular Florence), Rome, Naples, Turin and the Piedmont region, Milan and the Lombardy region, and Bologna and Emilia-Romagna, but I have never felt a strong urge to visit Venice as people talk about how expensive it is and over-tourism
If I go to a place I tend to take time to stay there
Thanks
Thanks, I’m thinking about spending at least 3-4 days if I come visit, I agree with you that rushing through a place by staying for just one night doesn’t do the place justice
(Aside: there is a restaurant in Wellington New Zealand that does Venetian food (Ombra   ) and they have very different food from most other NZ Italian places, am always keen to see whether real Venetian bars are like that)

Just wondering which of the ex-Warsaw Pact countries are NATO members now

You can cook on the barbeque then eat inside
The heat from the barbeque will keep you warm whilst outside
If you have an outdoor fireplace, that's kinda a different story
But if you don't have an outdoor fireplace or similar, some food just tastes better barbequed though, such as steak
So it would be a waste to not barbeque it even if it's too cold to eat outside

> I am also all for them rejoining the EU
But I hope they have a plan for how they are going to leave, function as an independent country and how to rejoin the EU
They made up a bit 700 page plan last time around
Full of things like details
unlike the Brexit campaign
I trust they will do the same this time around
Thing is though that everytime you do make a plan, people will criticise the details of it
If you just waive around some unicorns (like what brexiteers did and are still doing) it's somehow harder to criticise since the slightest bit of criticism can be met with pulling yet another unicorn out of one's arse

>  I just find it so bizarre that a bunch of random people from Poland/Germany/Italy or wherever are so ardent about it happening, even more so than half of Scotland
Its like they care more about the UK suffering rather than what Scottish people want
I think it's them recognizing that the UK has piss-poor leadership (and has for the past ~40 years) and wanting people stuck under that to have an alternative
> Corsica can go lol ,if they want to no one can stop them
They're quite feisty to say the least
I agree
I'm from PACA, not Corsica but if they really want independence then I have no intention of stopping them and I wish them all the very best for the future
> The experts are pretty clear on Scottish Independence
It has no real benefits
You don't give a shit about the experts

For me Lyon is lovely, although my absolute favourite French place outside of Paris is Strasbourg in Alsace, followed closely by Avignon plus some tiny towns in Provence Vaucluse (Gordes, Orange, Apt)
I was surprised on my visit to Lyon too
Before I always thought Lyon is central France psychologically, the tourist office’s guide told us Lyon is definitely southern in culture compared with Paris, with the cultural border somewhere at the Burgundy region (Dijon)
I love reading you both’s comments
I had been to Provence on a previous trip before (Avignon, Vaucluse, Marseille/Cassis) the year before I went to Lyon, so I thought Southern is something like Marseille or Avignon and didn’t consider Lyon southern
But if the official tourist office guide told us all (there were probably 60 people in the day tour group) that Lyon is part of the south, I took her word
:-)
But food wise, the bouchon dishes (like rognon de veau in a mustard creme sauce served with potato dauphinois) have very little in common with provencial fares you see from further south, and I felt they are far more similar to Parisian bistro cooking

> Also 18 cases sound amazing
It's not all that
Most of the cases are what would be prepositions in other languages, they just get to be called cases because they're a part of the word rather than a separate word
Finnish (Ugric in general) cases tend to be very regular and pretty specific in their use, rather than the Swiss army knife hodgepodge you get in IE languages
There is a [partitivity distinction] between the partitive and accusative cases where IE languages would use different verbs, so that's interesting
I was in Germany in 2014
Observation is:
Berlin: they don’t speak much if on the eastern parts: I asked a shopkeeper direction and she understood my question in English but replied in German
Western parts, yes but not very well
Leipzig: the younger people speak English
Over 45’s: not really
Frankfurt: restaurant workers: in general with general English
Heidelberg: not a lot outside the obviously touristy places, and I spoke German as a local friend was with me there
Some rural places close to the Hambach Castle in Rheinland-Pfalz (Rheinland-Palatinate): can speak simple English
In general I think most people understand more English than France, but outside of international cities the level of English spoken is close to say Provence in France (where English is fairly common due to the number of English-speaking tourists)
Alsace, in comparison, speaks far less English than say, Leipzig
Macron is probably the first French president/PM level politician that I know who speaks good English
I think foreign ministers should speak English well but for other politicians I wouldn’t worry much (say for the Interior Minister or mayor of Paris, it is not as much big deal if they don’t have a professional level of knowledge in English)

I’m old enough that Poland was still a Communist country when I was a child, and the Solidarity movement was going on
Still remember the international news coverage were very bleak about Poland, they were always about food shortages and people were queuing for hours just to buy essential food
And now we got this today
Just don’t know if I should be sad people don’t cherish the times when things are plenty, or glad that those days of people queuing for hours and saw empty shelves are ancient history
(Edit: made edit to emphasise I’m not a Pole, just that I’m old enough that when I was a kid, Poland was still a Communist state back then)

I lived through the whole process it was my last year in primary school
It was basically going from an impossible scenario to becoming inevitable in just over one year’s space
Looking back you can argue WWII wasn’t legally over for Germany until Oct 3 1990
And the date picked was by accident - I hadn’t realised the actual date of reunification was “that one” until it happened, the news were reporting on all German election in Dec 1990 so people were assuming Jan 1 1991 or Dec 25 1990 or some dates around Christmas and New Year
God must be playing jokes with the 9 Nov date
Thanks for the correction and filling in the constitutional backgrounds
I thought the 1990 all German election was an special one-off election outside the Basic Law
Most foreign news reports outside Germany didn’t make it clear (if you read new archives from the New York Times, Chicago Tribune, or UK Independent) - they make the readers assume that election was an ad hoc one
Historians tend to group wars into major or minor groups in retrospect: the 19th Century was often called 100 Years’ Peace between the Napoleonic Wars and WWI (the Crimean War, Balkans Wars, Austro-Prussian War or the Franco-Prussian War didn’t count as major conflicts)
The criteria is fairly subjective: if not all major countries were involved in the same conflict then it didn’t count
If we used that traditional criteria set by historians then we would call Europe since 1945 or 1989 or 1995 as living in peace
But as you said above that this is arbitrary
The English language history and political science textbooks still use the term Kristallnacht
I think if the chan he takes hold in Germany, it takes another 10 years or so for the term change to reach English-language circles

There are in fact jobs like that out there that are like this - in my industry and others the Big Four firms don’t only do financial practice advice, but do all kinds of strategic management and commercial/operational management consultancy work too

The biggest shocks are:
Shop staff in general don’t say “hi” to customers at all in the Northeast (all the big cities like New York, Philly, Washington DC, Boston, and even suburban smaller cities like Harrisburg or Rochester NY), unlike New Zealand
Bank notes are in the same colour
Metric systems aren’t used
Paper bags were available at supermarkets
In a supposedly clean green New Zealand until 2018 you would be given plastic bags
Coins: the higher denominations don’t necessarily mean larger size
Also there are still 1c coins
Prices aren’t tip and tax inclusive
In NZ you pay what the signs says
People don’t really trust non-chain independent/artisan restaurants, cafes, shops
(My family in the US would loathe to visit standalone cafes
Even though they do know they exist in say San Francisco or Northeastern big cities) Franchised chain stores penetrate to a far deeper extent economically and culturally than NZ
It can be ignorant of the outside world in amusing ways
And sorry, it happens to both the left and right
I have seen plenty of American leftards left with egg on their face on Reddit and elsewhere on social media
You can’t order small sized drinks and meals
Motorways/interstates penetrate everywhere unlike New Zealand
And road conditions are years ahead of New Zealand even in states with relatively bad roads (say Pennsylvania)
Utilities like electricity and water are probably worse on the other hand
I think for 1, it may also be a regional thing too
In the Midwest Detroit people do say hi to customers
Other than that it is a big city vs smaller places difference
Up until 1990 NZ has 1c and 2c coins too
But they got phased out
My family have lived in Pittsburgh, Rochester, now Detroit, and go to tier 2 cities around the country a lot
They are middle class working professionals
I was taken back when they asked me whether the cafe in NZ I’m bringing them to are chains places
In NZ usually the local places have better food even though the price differences between chains (say, Starbucks) and locals (say, the Unknown Chapter cafe, in Central Chch) are minimal
No offence taken regarding your last point
Everyone’s different, I’m more foodie and travel oriented than them (while I don’t care as much about cars sports or consumer electronics (!))
But glad to know that if I ask for local favourite places to eat I wouldn’t be treated as a weirdo in the US
But, but, but

- Schneider Electric was German (it is in fact French)
- Alstom was English (is French)
- Opel was German (was American, now French)
-Braun Appliances were German (is American)
- Rowntree was American (was UK before acquired by Nestle)
- Nestle was American (is Swiss)
I always know Addidas is German, but I thought Puma was Hong Kong like G2000 or Espirit
until I learn it is German by googling
I thought it was German until now, glad to know its true origin
At my German class in high school (New Zealand) we had to memorise the locations of major German cities and tourist towns in German
The one I always struggled with the most is Hanover (Hannover in German) and I never understood why we had to learn about Hanover and pinpoint it on a map
Well the textbook was published in the UK
And then I learned the House of Hanover some years later, when I was at university
(Also: in our term exam for the German class there was a section where we just filled in names [in German] of the German cities we learned from class on a map of Germany
It turned the German exam into a Geography question
Growing up in HK (years before the handover) baked beans had been common “ordinary folk” dinner fares at homes for almost all socio-economic groups
They were usually from China or the UK
The ones from the UK were usually marketed as “English-style tomato sauce baked beans” showing off they were quality product
Then when we came to New Zealand I got used to Watties baked beans (which is owned by Heinz, but Watties started as a local company) for breakfasts and baked beans on toasts
I thought Airbus has no single home country, it has always been EU-wide plus UK

I didn’t notice them when I was in Melbourne, where there were two or three local gelato chains around
I have a German friend who said one game he and his friends used to play when they were small is to look at car licence plates and guess where they come from
Coming from Hong Kong and New Zealand it is an archivist or transport buff’s dream: classifying things by the initials
I know from Australian and US licence plates will have different colours and designs depending on the states, and Canada according to provinces, while France shows car licences with the department numbers it was issued from (75 is Paris, 93 is the notorious Seine-Saint-Denis)
But I didn’t realise German licence plates could be classified by the alphabets in addition to state where it is issued
I think from a marketing standpoint it is some exotic places, and exotic foreign sounding = high quality premium product
Sorry to chine in as a foreigner
I’m a history geek myself and my area of interests is on world history from AD/CE 1500 to today
I keep noticing that if things turned out only slightly differently in the 19th and early 20th century like a different set of monarchs, leaders, and other countries’ response, we wouldn’t have a separate Austria today
It may be a Germany with Vienna as the capital, or even a pie in the sky scenario, multiple capitals and different branches of government divided between Vienna, Berlin, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Munich and Magdeburg for starters (!)
I still think that history turned in a particular way that Austria today is a separate country
(Please forgive me if it’s not appropriate for a foreigner to butt in here)
Oh I listed Magdeburg here because it was an ancient seat of government under a few Middle Age Holy Roman Emperors
So a historically-minded government may decide to keep some government branches there to remind people that Magdeburg was one of the old capitals
Alternatives would be Nuremberg or Quedlinburg
That sounds like some countries inEast Asia
There is a proverbial “I have time to die but no time for getting sick” in Hong Kong
Also work stress can vary very widely even within the same sector
I have been working at the same workplace under different CEOs: at one point the workplace can only be described as laid back and like semi holiday: people were treated kindly but people work because they were motivated to work well, now under a different top guy it is an “you do nothing but work during work hours”, “we got all these performance targets to hit
If you don’t hit them this year then haha”. All that is in New Zealand
And I’ve been told Australia is the same: it really depends which workplace you end up at, as the cultures vary extremely widely depending on the individual organisation and their current boss
The normal practice in New Zealand is you pay exactly the food and drink you ordered yourself, although I have been to occasions where the bill is split evenly across all
(Then for Asians: immigrants of my parents’ generation will take turns treating the group for meals
My generation tend to go Dutch
Native born European Kiwis of course go Dutch)
What’s the sub, if you don’t mind me asking
Here in New Zealand you don’t get the equivalent number the IRD number until you open a bank account or start your first student job, which are typically at 17
In some cases parents open Kiwisavers (retirement fund) for them then it becomes 10/11
People say German or French bureaucracy are bad
But I have had experience with NZ one (not known for its bad bureaucracy) that can be almost as strange too
Not me though, my family didn’t see any needs until I had to when I got a cash prize for my academics and I was starting university soon
Can always go in the other direction
How about when you're visiting another planet
I have a pervert wish: wanting to visit Eisenhüttenstadt
hmm I wonder why
When I was in Berlin in 2015, I walked around the eastern part of the city after getting off at the terminus of U1, I can’t remember the name for the S-Bahn station next to it, but the scene of rows if apartment blocks reminded me of Beijing and (from videos I had seen) Pyongyang
I went to Lyon on a day trip from
Paris in 2015
Once I got off at the main TGV train station (Gare de Lyon-Part-Dieu) there was a guy (that guy looked “European” French) who approached me in English asking if I need a ticket for the local transport and he has some on sale
Remember this is France and people don’t suddenly start speaking in English to someone for no reason, so I concluded he must have been a scammer
After I said no once, seeing I got from the ticket info booth to a vending machine, he was very insistent on me buying a ticket from him
The funny thing was there was a ticket inspector at the end of my metro ride into the city from Part Dieu
He had a hand held device that checked whether the ticket was legitimate
I got a ticket from the machine, so there was no drama for me
But if I got the ticket from that guy I would be in huge trouble
PS: another funny thing
The vending machines don’t accept notes and only coins
When I tried to ask the lady at the info booth if I could buy a ticket from her because I don’t have enough coins, she said no I must buy tickets from the machine, and I didn’t have sufficient change then I just had to get the coins somewhere
So it turned into a detour to Relay and buying a bottle of water first before coming back with enough change to get the local public transport ticket (!)
Talk about being inflexible
It is a universal thing when you go to a concert or show here in New Zealand too, the exception is you always finish the ice-cream at the common area outside the concert hall/theatre, and never bring them inside
In New Zealand whenever I get to tourist hotspots around the South Island there’s 50% chance I hear German and the other French if they aren’t Chinese/Korean/Japanese/Indian tourists (I was born in Hong Kong, and I speak A little French, plus a few words in school German, in addition to English and Chinese)
It is a surreal thing that I don’t really hear any other languages that much
Kid you not, we had a nutritionist visiting my high school when I was a student back then, and gave us this talk about healthy eating and she said don’t drink too much fluid during meal because it would dilute your gastric acid
Places sell both ice-cream and wine (and also hot drinks and orange juice) in New Zealand
Come to think of it, at the Christchurch town hall you even get sandwiches, bratwurst, or cheese plus salami and crackers pack too if you want savoury
I remember going to a concert at Leipzig’s Gewandhaus in 2015, and (being used to seeing wine or ice-cream at classical concerts in New Zealand) I was surprised to find out that there was no ice-cream on sale during the interval, only wine
I always assume Germany as a whole is very honest and at New Zealand and Nordic-level of (lack in) corruption
Is this correct
Thanks
France does this too, if my memory serves right
I had wine in my mug at home by myself once (!), and swore that I’d never do it again
Wineglasses are designed in that shape for a reason - and I couldn’t get the fullest of the wine’s scent/aroma from drinking out of a mug
Cantonese comes very close to Russian here
The swear words are an art in itself
But it is also a social marker: if you are well educated m, are well off, and generally in humanities subject, you don’t swear
If you are well off but of STEM and/or Commerce/Business background, and work as Accountants, big corporation managers, investment bank bankers/traders, you do
You are a self-made man
You will swear
You are poor and engage in manual labour
You swear a lot too
I don't think they do though
It seems to me that many tourists want something that is different enough to be exotic, but similar enough to what their palate is used to, to be reassuring
So many of my countrymen go on these appalling "Contiki tours" and eat in tourist traps on purpose
My main food-finding method when travelling is look for a place that is not welcoming to me and where I don't understand anything
I loiter for a while, then follow a local in and try to copy them
It's always a surprise to see what I have just ordered
No kidding: I was told off often when I wrote in small or untidy scripts like when I was rushing things through or was tired
But I was told off once by a secretary at my old high school for the writing - it was so neat to her that she thought “you writing is like a girl’s”. I was in my late 20s, and hadn’t been back to Hong Kong for years then, and I was there as an adult and old boy at the school
Basically for Kiwis it is none of anyone’s business in the NZ culture to tell off another adult for their writing - so I was taken aback a bit by the conformism in the Hong Konger collectivist culture there as this is the thing I had outgrown/forgotten over the years
Same question
Have never seen anyone  (whether guys or girls) writing in “a” in NZ
This to me is a print font
I used to in high school, but it was never taught and something I just did for a while to be fancy, a few others and a couple of teachers did too
Not super uncommon but not usual
Do people joke about Macau, Goa, and Timor Leste (East Timor, or formerly the Portuguese Timor) too
Not really covered in NZ media aside from the odd article or two
I'm only familiar with it since I prefer international news sources to local ones
It'd be nice if Belarus got a new leader via fair elections, but I'm rather skeptical that will actually happen
Nope
Here media ownership is a good mix of crown owned, publicly traded shareholder owned, and privately owned
Of the privately owned, some are locally owned, and some by overseas investment firms and media conglomerates, none of which are linked to Rupert Murdoch as far as I can tell
But doesn't the individual retailer or chain set the prices
If manufacturing companies set the retail price there would be no competition in the market
Yeah because a guy from Brazil is the same as someone from Chile  and is the same as someone from Mexico  ha
I always get the impression Americans view the world as European , Black ( but you can't say that so they are African american no matter where they are from), Asian and Latin
Like fuck the thousands of the rest
A Guy from Madrid is the same as a Guy from Stockholm unless they speak then  the guy from Madrid is Latino because he speaks the language of Latinos therefore they fit into that niche
When I was growing up (both Hong Kong and New Zealand), all the teachers I had at school taught Chopin and Marie Curie were Polish
Some interesting antedote: a sibling emigrated to the US instead of New Zealand (we were Hong Kong in origin BTW just to make things clearer), and he always seems angry at what he sees as anti-American digs at the US everything from a number of Britons
I notice my UK-origin friends and work colleague do this quite often, they think it is tongue in cheek to tease Americans for say not having Guy Fawkes firework, but didn’t care/realise sometimes it is because of conscious history decision (on the issue of Guy Fawkes: none other than Geoege Washington himself forbade the US to observe the Guy Fawkes day)
Such type of behaviours towards Americans are largely absent or more muted from Aussies, curiously
This is a reason we are told trying to hide our online presence/activities as much as can, because it can land in your potential future employer, landlord, etc’s hands
At least in many English-speaking countries with insufficient privacy protection culture, this can mean you don’t get a job offer or lose out at the last hurdle because your potential employer learns from your social media presence online that you hold an unpopular political stance (even though legal but may be politically controversial/unpopular stance right now)
It’s not just the US, this practice is endemic in corporate cultures across the entire English-speaking world
And it is deemed neither illegal nor breaching any privacy protection and employment laws, and neither is it deemed unethical or immoral
What I have read is all advices/suggestions adapt to the practice, if you are found to be hosting a politically unpopular stance that costs you a potential job, shame on you for letting your beliefs become so publicly accessible that your potential employer has learned about this, and better effort needed in getting them hidden
I’ve seen France Televisions or LCI interviewing him for over 30 minutes, and they didn’t use subtitles
I’m trying to decipher the limit and convert this into an ordinary differential equation, ...
I know this is unrelated, but I learned from French classes the phrase « métro, boulot, dodo » which explains the daily grind in a graphic way
You can literally “feel” you dread waking up and turning up for work
I always remember the nightclub toilet guy saying " Freshen up for the Punani"
[New Zealand enters the chat]
When I was growing up our city seemed to have two speeds - some people started at about 19:00 and some people started about 12 or 1am
It was kind of weird because there were always drunk people leaving town just when I was getting there
We used to have these weird safety ads that pretended to be commercials:
Yep
Since she's also our head of state, it will technically be a victory for New Zealand as well
This is the scene at 3 am Saturday and Sunday - ie drinking started Friday/Saturday night - in Auckland CBD zone with lots of pubs (like the Viaduct Harbour, Wyndard Quarter), Wellington (Courtney Place), Christchurch (Oxford Terrace, Victoria Street) too
I was surprised by the original post, I thought the US has a generational divide that those under-45 are big into uninhibited drinking, while those older are almost total teetotalers
Moderate social only drinking only exists in non-UK Europe
(At least from French Germans Italians I know they are into moderate social drinking
I have never seen them getting drunk
Meanwhile all English-speaking countries seem to make uninhibited drinking a national culture)
L’apéro is one of the French habits I picked up through Alliance Française from their French classes and events
It’s cool to have a drink and a snack to chill out on Friday after work and before meals
I remember some shocking scene on my first trip to the UK in 2014 was seeing wasted people: one was at the Cambridge train station on a Thursday evening at 8 pm, the other is in London Saturday evening at bit earlier at 5 pm ish walking back from the National Gallery, there was a decently dressed person that got kicked out of a pub for being very intoxicated
I was shocked because you don’t see obviously drunk people coming out of pubs that early in New Zealand: a “better” time to check how many got drunk at an NZ pub would have been after 10:30 pm at the earliest, often it is more like after midnight
(From what I have seen in Australia it is similar to NZ, people normally don’t get drunk at 5 or 6 pm)
TIL
Funny that the French teachers and the French acquaintances I meet through Alliance Feancaise here in New Zealand never get drunk at the private parties or AF events
Maybe they are being polite
;-)
Sorry, AF = Alliance Française
We have events like Beaujolais nouveau tasting (with lots of authentic Brie, paté served with wine), Opening sessions at the annual French film festivals, and also at the end of each term’s French classes we being food and drinks to class to make a feast together between 7-8 of us in class plus the teacher
I know a woman from my French class, she is from Germany and her husband is French
They never come across as heavy drinkers from the parties I have been to
That makes sense, TIL
I hope that one day I can experience something like a French family lunch with the full courses and alcohols ( I think I can have up to 2
5 drinks at most at a meal)
One day I hope I will be invited to experience one ...
Not European myself, one of the sayings I heard on my first trip to Europe was in France - at the Provence region
Our native tour guide mentioned that Europe had been constantly at war at every level nonstop since the end of the heyday of the Roman Empire (after AD 200) until 1945
The period since WWII is the first time since the Roman Empire that Europe hasn’t had large scale wars for extended period
Of course there’s the Yugoslav Wars and Ukraine and Georgia and Armenia/Azerbaijan and Bow Turkey, but they aren’t like all the major powers in Europe are fighting each other
This is probably off topic on a European subreddit, but I do take that the next major war (and looking at things now, I think it will be a matter of if, not when the next major war will break out) will not be between European countries, or between any countries we count as part of “the West”. My pick is the next major war will break out in East or SE Asia
What was said about the UK applies to New Zealand too, except WWI and WWII are now viewed as nation building experience plus fighting for freedom here
Which is strange that literally no one under the age of 65 today in 2021 would have any experience taking up arms fighting in a war for New Zealand
(I’m discounting peacekeeping as real fighting a war type of serving, NZ has only involved in peacekeeping since Vietnam War half a century ago)
Nah here email is still the term
Gmail is the most popular provider outside of work email address though  although I still get the occasional Hotmail address  on resumes
XxCuNTpuNcHer69Xx at hotmail is not so professional though ha  ( example only, feel free to use although it's probably taken )
Try asking this question in /r/AskAnAfrican then, given France's colonial history
No, I'm just saying, if you were to ask Algeria, Senegal, Mali, et cetera which country had the most influence on their history, they would say France
And for New Zealand, I don't know if France would make the top 3, but the French doing nuclear testing in the Pacific and killing one of our protestors in an act of terrorism certainly helped shape sentiment about nuclear power here
As for the Maori, well the French were planning to subjugate the Maori and colonise their lands, only the British got there first
Hi all, I’m late to the party
The only language I understand well here is French (am learning it towards intermediate level), then remotely following that is Italian, and very little of Catalan
Surprisingly I find Spanish difficult to understand, and Portuguese and Romanian are kind of equally difficult for me to get their meanings
I always hear French in the context of formal announcements and speeches or news programs and narrations in documentaries, so it often sounds a little formal officialese in a very flat tone to me
(Learning towards B1 in French myself)
I always thought of Pavarotti or the Godfather
But bow I gave heRd more of native Italian speaking people I think everyday Italian talking sounds like middle aged to senior aged Chinese-speakers sitting at the park or at a restaurant with friends whinging over a cup of tea
The talks between middle aged Chinese-speakers chatting over a shared lunch don’t sound like Italian at all BTW - it would sound too rapid and Italian can sound too “composed” when compared with excited Cantonese or Hokkienese or Taiwanese or Mandarin social talks
A ex-workmate joked to me years ago that the only French sentence I ever need to know is « où sont les toilettes ? » when travelling in France - after I told him I was starting taking French courses
He speaks Portuguese and Hebrew in addition to English
Hahahaha, it’s more my personal preference
Most Kiwis would cpnsider French from the satirised “cheese eating surrender monkeys” or the Inspector Clouseau
It may be common to all Sino-Tibetan languages, although Thai sounds soft to me
Cantonese is probably the toughest sounding Sino-Tibetan language out there
A lot of other people say we sound like we’re always arguing (!)
Coincidentally I never get the reason the native English speakers say German sounds angry
Disclaimer: know Cantonese as 1st language speaker, and can speak simple-intermediate level (A2) Mandarin
LOL you should listen to talks when Cantonese speakers are really angry and arguing with each other
The insults are very colourful and the volume can wake up the grandma 6 blocks down the street
In Māori: Hōne māte hite wā tu a tawhane teru ta tāke whorehete, ouneri tū whainete aote tete hī whōkote ta mani
Māorifying the sentence is a bit tricky since there aren't many consonants and all syllables end in vowels
I grew up in Asia but have been in New Zealand since I was a teenager
In NZ society in general won’t make a big deal out of you whether you have been to university or not, and let alone which one :-p . But in Asia (at least in East Asia and I believe for SE Asia too), being graduates from prestigious (in their view) universities in the West or locally is a very big deal
There is still residual naked open snobbery from people who have been to Oxbridge or Ivy League or Stanford, Berkeley, Northeestern, Toronto, Waterloo, Melbourne etc, looking down upon people who come from “average universities” or with no tertiary education at all
Oxford does pretty well in some STEM areas too
I have someone close to me who is an academic in automotive eng and has done collaborations with people from Oxford
But it is true in general
I have a friend who is big humanities - literature geek - he is a lawyer BTW
One of the first places he visited when he got to the UK the first time was to visit Oxford because of the C.S. Lewis connections
He is not interested in STEM and gave Cambridge a miss due to its science reputation
I thought (like countries such as New Zealand and Taiwan) good researchers are elected fellows at institutes, but they are still mainly doing their work based at university
Is that like this in Germany too
PS: my family have academic links: my father is knee deep in history, while I have a brother who goes very deep in mech engineering (particularly automative related stuff)
Their researcher/professor acquaintances and friends tend to have dual roles at institutes and universities
And then have it traverse Russia, have North Korea open up to the world, and arrange for an underground tunnel to be build between South Korea and Japan
The end result being able to take a high speed train from London to Tokyo
At least one can dream
It's 9556 km from London to Tokyo in a straight line, so accounting for geography it would probably be about 10,000 km, or slightly over
At 400 km/hr that would make the journey slightly over 25 hours, probably a little bit longer due to border crossings
I just barely started school when the Kurt Waldheim affair was all over the news on TV
I didn’t realise how significant it was until years later at university level, that this was so sensitive because for the first time Austria had to confront that they were a willing member of the Axis as much as Germany, and not really a second Switzerland that got invaded by Nazi Germany
The reason I don't like it is because I'm a massive language nerd, but because people speak my native language so often I never get to really practice other ones
In my experience people in Greece, Sweden, Netherlands, Portugal, and most young people in France and Germany can all speak English really well
Which is a huge shame for me because I'm really good at French and I've been passively learning those others for years now
But I'll never be able to *really* use them because everyone just defaults to English when I make mistakes, so I never get better especially with my speaking competency
I envy you non-natives so much haha :(
ναι αφολουθώ(;) το subreddit r/GREEK και με βοηθά πολύ :)
It’s called Shandy in New Zealand and the UK
I think male guys asking for it will get laughed off, to many people it is considered a drink for ladies since the lemonade dilutes the bitter taste of hops and makes the beer “weaker”.
Meanwhile in New Zealand it is called in the wops (or the wop wop)
Grew up in Hong Kong before the 1997 Handover, and old enough to have been schooled by old school teachers who punished you for using American English
New Zealand was never that snobbish at even the stuffiest elite schools
Some of the most important differences: lorry is never used (truck/ute instead), we don’t say sweets here (lollies instead), football is very rarely used and mostly by UK immigrants (soccer), mince pie means savoury beef mince in gravy pie and not sweet raisin+candied peels mince pies you usually get at Christmas
Lux/vacuum is another one I remember from school textbooks
Do you have any unsweetened coffee choices in Italy
I love to get something like a dash of milk (not too much but just make it not completely black) in an iced coffee but not sweetened any way
Thanks
In New Zealand:
Twink = correction fluid = white out as in the US (twink even made it to certain NZ English dictionaries
It has been very rare)
Xerox = photocopy
Lux = vacuum cleaner
Google = web search
Universal
"bandaid" is a brand name as well
The generic term is sticking-plaster
This is interesting to me because a few of them are really similar here but different, eg "Thermoskanne" for vacuum flask - here that same company is just called Thermos, so we use "thermos" for vacuum flask
Not Europe: one thing is our capital Wellington is not the largest city and not the economic centre either, even though the stock market is based there
The largest city is Auckland and because it’s 3x the size of Christchurch the next largest city, and where 80% of immigrants to NZ live in Auckland it has a very different feel to anywhere else
The rest of the country call Aucklanders Jafas (“Just a *Friendly* Aucklander) and seriously hate Auckland
Both Aucklanders and the rest of the country refer the rest of the country as “south of the Bombay”.
One thing that is so unique is Paris is so much bigger than the next largest city Marseille
I come from New Zealand which is commonly thought of as a small country with a tiny population
Yet the largest city Auckland already has about the same population as Marseille
Many French cities are comparable to NZ’s in size
Same in New Zealand
The rest of the country hate Auckland
Both sides claim “New Zealand begins/ends at the Bombay” (Bombay Hill = the hilly range that is like an informal boundary for the Auckland region)
Quel honte !  What a shame
I have been to France but not Italy
Is Rome a bit like having Paris’s history and the government thing, but Milan has the economic centre and arrogance of Paris
Or there is no city in Italy that has Paris’s respective reputation within France, but rather Rome and Milan together share the equivalent reputation
I have a friend from high school here (New Zealand) who lives in Paris with his also-Kiwi wife
When we were catching up I asked him where France’s famously vibrant intellectuals/thinking scenes are
He said it’s now Berlin which is Europe’s centre for intellectuals where they congregate
Paris is only a shell from before the 1960s/70s and it is mostly tourists from outside Europe wanting to experience it, but not much of that remains
It seems to me that French people and people who live in France have a very rosy view of Berlin
New Zealand here and I have East Asian blood: “European” Kiwis dress more for  occasion but people don’t dress that differently according to socio-economic status, I have seen very similar style clothings even if they are rich Remuera/Fendalton compared with someone who went to more normal middle class high school, or are from lower middle class backgrounds
I remember meeting some people who are English and part of the Oxbridge educated, Fleet Street, City [of London] worker elite crowds, and who immigrated or were visiting to NZ, and they don’t dress any differently from someone from say Mt Albert or Westies in Auckland NZ (lower middle class)
Foe Asian immigrants and descents, your dress says a lot about your upbringing/background
This is some legacy from the original/ancestral homelands: in Asia people put on a much higher premium on dress and appearances - the cultural value is to dress to the best ability you can afford: even casual clothings are reflections of your own upbringing and socio-economic status
Funny this runs deep
in my own family too, each argument must be backed up by documentary or numerical evidence, only that I live in NZ and is of East Asian migrant background
You spelled cousin wrong
That looks like Auckland University in New Zealand
They look pretty pleasing to me, there are plenty of generic high rise apartment blocks around Germany that look uglier than these 10
The Bahnhof at Duisburg seems modernist
I walked around the area when I visited Germany in 2015
It looks average to me, not ugly but as you say people are mot liking the concept anymore
That could be used as Engineering School building
My old uni’s Engineering School in New Zealand looked like this until the 2016 renovation
It is not, parts of the eastern portion of Berlin looks more like Pyongyang
You’re right, it looks ouch
I spent a normal (workday) Monday morning there touring the city
Just be honest it has a few seedy red lights sex industry places and a few places/bars that look sketchy
Didn’t notice any junkies there but I imagine it will be a different tale if I were there during the evening
I think it is a myth to claim all of “Europe” has “free health care”. You pay a health premium contribution too in the form of either taxation or a health insurance premium-like health contribution
What it often means in welfare society is that you are not a citizen, you won’t receive the same degree of healthcare because you are not a contributor
Which is why there are national IDs and system of registration as to where you live
The case of arguing if “undocumented immigrants can receive treatment beyond emergency care” is unthinkable in Europe because they are not tax contributors
As far as I know, the only two societies with what you call closest to universal healthcare are the UK with the NHS, and Taiwan
In the case of the UK you still pay an NHS surcharge if you are resident foreigners or non/resident UK British citizens
Thanks, I stand corrected
For me, I'm a little bit of an armchair enthusiast of history
I don't really know what happened outside Britain, France, Germany, the Habsburg Empire when it comes to European history
And even for these countries, I only know the major events
It is literally one of the stepping stones to WWII, along with the Manchurian Incident (1931), the rise of Hitler and Nazi Germany (1933), Mussolini's invasion of Ethiopia (1936), the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937), the Anschluss of Austria, Munich (1938)
1930s were like a classic Greek tragedy, to borrowing from the Reader's Digest's Great Events of the 20th Century
I only know it as a precursor to WWII but not really specifically how it affected and still impacts Spain today
I learned about the land clearances in Scotland at high school Social Studies in NZ
It was presented as the peasants were kicked out and they flocked to the cities to become factory workers during the Industrial Revolution
This has been part of the New Zealand high school Year 11/5th Form History curriculum since forever
Everyone in NZ if they take History at NCEA Level 1 or the old School Cert will know this
(I didn't take history as I was a STEM student)
I learned it  for 6 weeks in my high school (in New Zealand) Social Studies/History class: from the 15th century explorations, the slave trade, to the 19th Century Age of New Imperialism: its causes and the Scramble for Africa, ending with the MacMillan "The Wind of Change" speech and decolonisation of the 1950s to 70s.
Did you guys learn how Britain achieved universal suffrage i.e. "real democracy" between the 18th century and 1969 (when the voting age was lowered to 18)
This is normally part of the curriculum for most Stage 1 university level Introductory 19th to 20th Century World History courses around the world
Thanks
I read some of it on my uncle's copy of the Reader's Digest's Great Events of the 20th Century
There was a chapter on the rise and fall of Mussolini and fascism: It mentioned the March on Rome, the assassination of Matteotti, his Ethiopian war, his fall in 1943, MSI, and final execution and hung upside down
But what you said above is even more detailed and fills some of the gaps I have
Thanks for filling us foreigners with the knowledge:
TIL They were separate uprisings
Always thought they were two parts of the same one from history books
Odd enough it was presented as the "Agricultural revolution" in the module that also included the Industrial Revolution and Information Revolution
I did pick that the land clearances were different from the two other technology revolutions
It must have been selected as you say, one consequence of the land clearances was dispossessed people went to NZ as settlers
Not European here (New Zealand): generally the observation is Kiwis don’t, apart from California, New York (and only know New York the city, not upstate), and maybe Hawaii
Maybe a stereotype view of Texas representing “Murrrica”. But that is the extent of it
People really know next to nothing about Wyoming Delaware or Nebraska
(Even Boston and New England are relatively unknown in NZ)
With regards to names, most can tell California, New York, Hawaii, Texas, maybe Nevada (Las Vegas
), but none beyond that
I think for things specific to Germany like Berlin S-Bahn, or what Leibniz the person accomplished German Wiki is more comprehensive
Engineering and science topics are “it depends”.
Wupperthal for me, weird since I've heard of all the cities before and after it and feel like I should know a city of that size
Same for me actually, Never heard of it
Then New Zealand reaps the benefit too: we are the only exporter of farmed Pacific salmon in the world (Chile used to as well, but their salmon farming had disappeared leaving NZ as a monopoly)
And nothing beats fresh Pacific salmon farmed in NZ, which I heard is much healthier than Atlantic salmon
Sorry, but can’t help bragging (and even though Norwegian salmon is tops too)
;-)
Warsaw was extremely bland imo, even Bratislava's old town was cuter than it
Not as big, but Lviv was the most boring
Didn't think it was too pretty either
Imo Kiev is the best parts of both those cities, so I loved it and can't wait to go back one day
Seriously, the Parisian restaurant prices you quoted are on par or still cheaper than the price you see at casual restaurants that are labelled “$$” on an “$$$$” scale here in New Zealand
Order a rump steak (cheapest cut) with a potato fries and a side vegetable included, plus a glass of wine, sets you at $45
Plus $5 to 8 if the steak is sirloin/porterhouse
This price will be $60 for rump or $65 for sirloin paired with red wine if eating at finer dining restaurants
I have been to a moderately popular (for foreigners) good Parisian bistro at the 12th arrondissement just off Gare de Lyon (À la biche au bois) - the prices are comparable to mid ranged restaurants in New Zealand
In New Zealand happy hours you can get NZ$8 beers during happy hour times
Otherwise be ready to shave NZ$10-12 “normally”...
When I was at school the whole Middle Ages was reduced into a generic bloc and learned about the feudal system, the Crusades, warfare in the Middle Ages, and the Mongol Empire (as preclude to the explorations chapter)
I had no idea about the specific states, much of that cane from self reading encyclopaedias
It depends, I know a friend who is a professional in her job (her job requires university degree and licensing) she doesn’t use much English on social media and certainly is less comfortable with using English than her husband, who also has university degree and working in social media (so strictly speaking not needing professional licensing like the wife does)
And the husband definitely speaks better English because his day job requires him to use English more than German
But then knowing English is one thing, being able to converse fluently and feeling comfortable with using it is another
Both the husband and wife are in late 20s.
That makes sense, thanks
I hope this doesn't offend anyone from this country, but whenever I happen to smell a combination of rain and cigarettes, I'm instantly brought back to my time studying abroad in Finland
I have no idea why, because the odds that I'm both out in the rain *and* passing by cigarette smoke at the same time is extremely small
But it's happened, and when it does it just reminds me of Helsinki
It's a good smell tho
I think the usage must have diverged somewhere in time
I was taught some writing conventions growing up in Hong Kong (date format on letterhead is like 21st September, 2020
But after coming to New Zealand even the most formal letters written here, with the current convention in place since the mid 1990s, will have dates written in the format of [21 September 2020] rather than [21st September, 2020
But this would still be far far too informal in Southeast Asia today (and unacceptable)
Not European myself
I like the locally roasted beans from some of the bigger cafes, like the Addington Coffee Co-op (Christchurch), Unknown Chapter (also Christchurch), or Flight Coffee (Wellington)
Bigger brands would
Be Grinders from Australia (the one used by Qantas)
In general I don’t drink coffee too often, so it is cheaper to pay one to two cups at most at cafes each week (I can use coffee machines at work so I don’t buy coffees during the week)
Do Italian cafes roast their own beans
Most bigger New Zealand cafes seem to have their own roasteries
Those that use beans roasted elsewhere often seem to be lesser in quality
I’m studying towards level B1 (CEFR standard) at French, and I have come across all 3 you mentioned, and y is also a form of pronoun if needed referring to objects related to the subject through à . (from my course notes it is called adverbial pronouns for grammar geeks)
Like  “I get to Auckland
”, « J’arrive à Auckland
» can be shortened to « J’y arrive ».
Fun fact: Cantonese speakers from Hong Kong (like me) would at times say “actually” far too often when speaking in English, because the translated “actually”, “in fact” etc are used as common conjunctions a lot more frequently than their equivalents in English
Cantonese speakers make this mistake too, because Cantonese requires inserting the equivalent of “to be” before “agree”.
Our French teachers at Alliance Française would mark us wrong in DELF exams though if we wrote « ça a fait du sens » . I’ve done A2 exams ...
Our French teachers mentioned that this is often said by English speakers and not as natural as « faire une photo »
I personally like that, although I believe in New Zealand English it is now more common to treat collective nouns as singular, like “the Police has appealed to the public for information”.
TIL: that lots of places in Europe have ID cards, We dont here in NZ
If you want to travel overseas you need a passport obviously or if you want to drive you need a drivers licence but we dont have a ID card as such
The Greek ID cards also have parents' names, with the father's name written in both Greek and Latin characters
Is it a requirement to put a parent's name on forms sometimes in Spain
Even as an adult I had to put my father's name on a car hire agreement on Greece
(I'm not Greek, didn't live there and no other info was requested of him so it was entirely useless info)
A good book to read is Germany: Memories of a Nation by Neil MacGregor
In chapter 1 MacGregor mentioned Prague and Charles University was at one point one of the epicentre of what we understand to be “German” culture today
I take that Prague was one of the most important culturally German city
Are all the parks administered by the local borough councils or the equivalent of the city council
This would have been the case in New Zealand like in Auckland or Christchurch, that no one outside the council or history geeks would care much for the different ownership structures of different parks
I think the OED (Oxford English Dictionary), the Merriam-Webster [dictionary], and the Chicago Manual of Style are the de facto authorities on English
At least for those who have studied at university level
I know this is about Europe but since this just happened a few days ago, I saw a guy park a car with French EU license plates in New Zealand
It was really weird, not only because we're closed off to tourism still, but also because I was nowhere near a big city, or even a medium one
I was in a really small town that does have some tourist appeal, but even if we could have tourists it would be the off-season
What would be the best bigger sized coffee that you can sit down, sip for 15-20 minutes, and relax at a cafe in Italy
I tend to order a long macchiato because you can finish an espresso in one minute
Thanks
The English-language textbooks used in the ESL courses still taught that “the UK 1 billion is 1,000,000 of 1 million, while the US 1 billion is 1,000 million” as late as the late 1990s. Of course students were taught the obsolete UK definition at school then found that the media and workplace use the short scale
Island nations: Am I a joke to you
Ah, so that's your secret
I've always liked your shape too
Chile is great, reminds me of a chili
It's true, you are the only boot
Locally the story is that the north island of NZ is a large dead fish (the tail is at the top)
Alright then
Guess we'll partition ourselves so we play by the rules
Sorry to butt in here, was that the same Charles V that ruled both the Austrian and Spanish Habsburg thrones, and who sacked Rome
It's aspirational
We had them here in New Zealand last year
They formed part of supermarket campaign where you only got them by collecting enough stamps at the supermarket each time you made a purchase
(i.e. you can’t buy them off the shelf at all)
I thought they were Swiss
Growing up it was a weird upper-middle-class interesting gadget that is nice to own (in Asia)
In New Zealand even the really wealthy homes don’t have them
It is called waste disposal units here in New Zealand
It is almost everywhere in New Zealand too (and I suspect also Australia but my Australian-based sibling and their family don’t have it)
Omg yes
And this is a perfect response to OP's question
It's grammatically correct, but archaic to use it as a standard tense
Native speakers do this too, with "Okay, so" or worse, just "So
" which I find  hellish because for some reason my brain is always tricked into trying to find a causal link between what follows and the previous sentence
"Please do what is needed".
"Kindly" was originally a courtesy word meaning "good natured", but in many forms of English (eg US, UK) it is usually only used as an admonition these days
"Needful" is an outdated (in British English) word meaning things that are necessary
The author Stephen King has a book about a haunted shop called Needful Things
That's so funny, over here saying "I'm going to the ocean" meaning the beach rather than, say, 3km out at sea, would be wildly poetic
No one says "shore" either, it would be "coast". "Seaside" just sounds British or like you're talking to children
That doesn't work
As soon as you replace "trouble" with "problem" you can see why:
"We are having problem with this".
If you are sending it to /u/bunnyechoes, please may I have a look as well
I would love to know exactly how you fixed that
Yeah, it's interesting
A number of differences between the varieties of first-language English are remnants from British English as it was spoken at the time of colonization, too
Eg the US "fall" for autumn, or the NZ "lollies" for sweets - neither evolved, they're just antiquated terms that were passed down intact
Oh I see, you're talking about concrete versus abstract nouns
In my experience, non-native speakers are more likely to run into this with specific singular nouns that *don't* require articles, eg "I come from the New York", but for confusion about abstract or uncountable nouns your rule makes sense
Thanks
I really love stuff like this
Your version is very deft
If the military in the 1930s took de Gaulle‘s opinions, and also if they started a strong war instead of Munich
For me the key is if Stambolić not trusted in  Milošević too much, or he were unable to unseat Stambolić. I think that Yogoslavia might survive as a loose confederation or even devolved peacefully into a Yogoslav Commonwealth like the Valvet Divorce had Stambolić stayed
In South Africa we drive on the left and we also use the left side of hallways
Public footpaths are kind of different to busy institutional corridors though
A fairer comparison would be thoroughfares such as underground escalators and airport travellators etc and it seems to me the Brits do have a clear sense of "side" on those
It says New Zealand because I’m actually from there but I’ve got dual nationality and am currently in Africa
Haha
Or touched very lightly and persistently with the corner of a shopping bag by someone who keeps darting angry glances at you
^This ^may ^have ^^happened ^^to ^^me
I remember reading up on news coming out of France from major media that early on during the first wave of teh epidemic, there were attempts by some shops to price gouge hand sanitser (gel hydroalcoolique) and the council of ministers issued a decree setting the maximum price allowable
If hand sanitiser were treated like that, that would presumably apply to masks too
(Also I read that at the early stages of the epidemic you needed a doctor’s prescription to purchase masks in France)
We had a shortage of masks over the counter too in New Zealand
We never needed a GP’s prescription but it was simply unavailable for purchase for a very long time
I enquired at a number of pharmacies around the 3rd week in February and all said that they were sold out
One then put me on a waiting list
It took me two months later for the order to arrive
And even then it was on a ration: I was allowed to purchase only 5
It wasn’t until the end of May at the end of the first lockdown that we could buy as many/little as needed
> Respect for the law
Ah yes, I will never forget being given directions that included: "then you will see a fence with big signs that say Zakaz Wstępu
What you must do is climb under the fence
A local Christchurch Italian restaurant introduced me to bergamotto and chinotto (they are like orange scented liqueurs)
I like chinotto almost as much as limoncello
I like Calvados, it has the apple taste in it
For me I like some mint flavoured liqueurs, does Get27 count as a liqueur
And also don’t forget Cointreau and Grand Marnier too
For people who are over 55 in Hong Kong it is French cognac (XO is considered the minimal standard, I know some wealthier people have Louis XIII as treasures at home)
The younger people are into wine so not so much
I almost misread it as Steinlager
;-) Steinlager is one of the biggest beer brands from New Zealand
And so is/was Hong Kong
People over 55 grew up with French spirits = cognac
> Black dudes offering you bracelets or stuff
There used to be a bunch of those in Paris, I think they were Italians
As soon as I saw the bracelets I was like hell no keep away so they just laughed and didn't bother me
No one in their right mind would travel to the US without full travel insurance though
Tell us some actual scams to be wary of
I don't get why anyone would *not* get the tube
Oh ok
As soon as you look at a transport map the tube seems like the obvious winner to me
But yeah tourist traps take many forms
Savages
I don't know how people can live like that
Kiwi with Asian backgrounds
99% of octopus served at Japanese restaurants would be octopus tentacles cooked (boiled) then thinly sliced and served with soy sauce and wasabi
Kiwi with Asian background (born in HK)
Native kiwis don’t specifically eat octopus although fried squid rings are a staple at fish and chips places
But octopus is super common at Mediterranean restaurants
Asian wise, the Japanese eat boiled octopus tentacles thinly sliced, served like sashimi but it is cooked
The only seasonings are soy sauce and wasabi
Or they will simply become pests in the new country without becoming drop bears
Winking at possums and what happened when they migrated across the Tasman to New Zealand
;-)
(PS: I love koalas but know that introducing them to the wild areas outside their native country can produce unintended consequences)
From New Zealand: like to think the Sunday roasts and bangers and mashes, fish and chips, trifles, every traditional
British dish tastes better in New Zealand than in the UK
Maybe it is fresher ingredients, and restaurants are more honest and not taking shortcuts
You’ll love Chinese then
;-)
Brothers: there is a separate word between a brother that is older than you, and one younger than you
Sister: same, there are different words for a sister older than you and younger
Grandfather and grandmother: there are different ones depending if the grandfather and grandmother are from your Dad’s side or Mum’s.
Uncles and aunts: different terms apply to the uncle and aunt if the are siblings of Dad or Mum
And then there are different terms whether they are older siblings than your parents or younger
(An exception is an uncle who is a sibling of your Mum - same term regardless whether he is older than your mother or not)
Oh, the uncle or aunt that is related by marriage ie the spouse of the one related to your parents, have names that say the “husband/wife of uncle/aunt —-“
Nephew/niece: yes they have different names depending whether they are your brother’s children, or sister’s.
Cousins: there are separate different terms if they are from male uncles from your father’s brothers
The cousins from your Dad’s sister’s children, and cousins from your Mum’s brothers or sisters, all share a second system of cousins titles
Who says Chinese family relation names are easy (!)
I found Lyon tourist offices, shops, and restaurants staff and passers by are pleasant people
Public Transport ticketing people on the other hand, at least the one I came across on my trip in 2015, was nasty rude - like the stereotype French officials
I have an ex-boss who is Scottish migrant from near Glasgow but called him Glaswegian
His accent was extremely thick coupled with he spoke very fast too
I know people from Edinburgh and they sound a lot easier to understand than my ex-boss LOL
Yeah we wear these poppies here in NZ
Australia does it and so does most of the commonwealth (I think, correct me if I am wrong)
As a kiwi, I think of the poppy as an ANZAC tradition, not a British one
I guess that we have a different day we wear poppies helps that impression
I've seen the occasional Aussie sports presenter wearing a sprig of rosemary as well
Czechovia sounds cool, but I'm just so used to Czech Republic though that any other just doesn't sound right
even though Czechia (or an anglicised version like Czeska) makes so much more sense
Also, Nike released a shoe called "The Black and Tan" around St Patricks day
But when I read the international news section about tornados it is always somewhere in the US
Or maybe Marie Curie
She and Chopin are the two Polish figures that I recognise as Polish (as an ignorant foreigner I haven’t read about many Polish people)
Are they serious
Because we have the Ban 1080 Party which is a serious party who want to stop our Department of Conservation from poisoning rats etc
TIL
This is so bizarre
Me too, Strasbourg (and Alsace in general) is a place where it is not too touristy (in general Alsace has tourists, but it’s definitely no Paris, Provence, Chambord, Mont St Michels)
People don’t have that tourism fatigue mood that you see in Paris, or preparing to rip you off mode you often encounter in PACA
I vote Leipzig too
If you want to find out more about the 1989 Revolution and GDR state terrors and resistance movement, Leipzig (along with Berlin, and one town in Saxony where it housed a maximum security prison for political prisoners - have forgotten the name of the former prison) is the place to visit
If you are into music, Leipzig is a must too
It has an easy popular vibe when Berlin is becoming a bit commercialised
Yep I think that’s the one
Thanks for the reminder
There was a guy in my highschool class that was being a di*k to me
I was a naive recent migrant from Asia then and got to that scholars-oriented class recently
He insisted I add “please” in all my questions and requests for help, in a very condescending way
All round unpleasant guy to me
In New Zealand we use eggplant and courgette (but someone I know sells at the farmer’s market and she used zucchini)
How about in business
I always start with “Good morning, this is [full name first followed by last name] speaking at [full name of the business]”. Thanks
I have just noticed almost very few mention their last names when they are answering business calls - unlike when they are making business calls and they are saying they are whom
I prefer stating my full name just to make it absolutely clear
Lisboa is well known in East and SE Asia for being the name of the late Stanley Ho’s flagship casino and hotel complex in Macau
There’s also a new Hotel Lisboa
From what I read the Polish pronunciation would be very different from attempting to pronounce them by reading them using the closest-looking English letters
Like Lodz, Wroclaw what I heard are nothing like “lots”, “Wow-claw”. An I right on this
Thanks
The
You have the French equivalents as well, which gave an yet entirely different set of spellings
As I’m learning French occasionally I manage to mingle by remembering the French names for the Italian city or region (!)
Roma - Rome (Eng) - Rome (Fr)
Palermo - Palermo (Eng) - Palerme (Fr)
Genova - Genoa (Eng) - Gênes (Fr)
Bolonga - Bolonga (Eng) - Bologne (Fr)
When I visited Marseille in 2014, the French tour guide told me t city was founded by Greeks do it was Greek at the very beginning
Non European here
You can imagine rugby is the national sport or even religion in Aotearoa
No other sport matters except for cricket and netball
It practically is the most popular sport down under with the next being cricket or football
I had read somewhere that WWI killed the sport’s popularity
Without that rugby could be Germany’s no
2 sport today
Hey we got 3 world cups first bro
Wow, I’m jealous, I never seen a match at Eden Park yet
Was it ABs
One of the things you overhear at work is you will meet someone who is one of the 4:
- they play rugby on weekends
- they are referees at rugby matches
- they have to take their children to school sports on weekends, likely to be rugby
- their family or one school friend is an ex-All Black
I happen to have all 4 even as an immigrant
Wait what
are they sold in the supermarket refrigerated
I never noticed when I have been over in Aussie
Here they are sold on the shelves and you can just leave them out
well Its probably a 50/50 thing some leave them out others chuck them in the fridge
Well TIL  yeah like I said the Eggs here are sold out on the shelves but all fridges have the bracket thingys for holding  them in the fridge
I have always left them out but I get through dozen in a week so never needed to keep them longer
to be fair, your country has a history of lying to the Irish ;)
It is considered weird here as well
But fuck them I always go alone
As someone with Asian skin and lived in Asia until my teenage years, I had better reception in Paris than Sydney ironically
(Not saying Sydney is any bad, but I found the average shop people less rude in Paris than Sydney, and also Paris has less yobbos/bogans yelling at you on “ching ch*** china***” which could happen out of random at some places in Sydney (or Auckland or Christchurch for that matter) very occasionally
Not all Aussies are bogan racists (and I have met nice bogans) but often enough that even a casual tourists can encounter at a reasonably hot spot like Manly at 4 pm on a weekend
Before I went to Paris for the first time, I was led to believe Parisians were cold nasty rude people, but I found it was OK and rather pleasant at the end
People were helpful even when they were rushing to business, they coped with my limited French
Starting from a position of low expectations can have its benefits
In New Zealand you can buy certain classes of over the counter medications at the supermarket, but not all
There are some that you still have to go to pharmacies to buy
And certainly for prescription items it has to be pharmacies
Wow, I was with you up until your example
So it's completely fine for the Pole in your example to feel uncomfortable around Muslims (based on racist generalisations thinking all Muslims are bad), but the second they are called out on that, they're the victims of racism and you defend them
I'm sure there are legitimate situations of anti-Polish sentiment in Germany, but that's definitely not a situation where people need to feel sympathy for the "victim".
The Soviet Union was one of the major supporters of Algeria during the FLN era
South Islanders
Interesting, I've never heard anyone pronounce it like that in real life, only on some British TV and that's still rare
My own anecdotal experience is pronouncing it normally, but if you can't then you say it like "sikst" or simply  "sikssss" with a longer emphasis on the s.
I know pubs in New Zealand used to close at 6 pm by law until 1967
It was intended to limit drinking but it achieved the opposite - men would go to the pubs after work, from 5 pm and then drink as much as they could until the closing time - it was callef “6 o’clock swill”. People would be drunk and fights would break out often and everyone were on the street at 6 pm
It seems that licensing, law, can create habits
Pubs in New Zealand used to have to close at 6 pm by law until 1967
Males would finish work at 5 then make a run to the pub and drink as much as they could before the pubs closed at 6 - “the 6 o’clock swill”. When they were out on the streets fights would break out
It sounded similar to what you describe
From my experience Edinburgh is just like familiar if you have been to Dunedin before
And in general I agree, I find Scotland to be similar to NZ - there is a love for home baking that got inherited throughout NZ
I mentioned on another comment to, too me the people who enjoy this film the most would be the ones who have had a relatable experience of living (studying or working ) overseas: maybe exchange students or people who had done working holidays overseas, expats on foreign job postings, or are immigrants themselves
I found this film (plus the other two of the trilogy) are particularly enjoyable if you have ever lived in a foreign country or moved to another country: it may be a student exchange, studying overseas, expat on assignment, OE (overseas experience), or immigrant
Maybe the person watching it is able to relate personally what the main character had gone through
I find this sub really chill in general, though
I have a semi off topic question: can anyone recommend the most popular Polish sausage types
I have rd Wikipedia and they seem to be very brief
I’m keen to learn more about them
Thanks
I’m in New Zealand
No as far as I know we don’t have Polish shops other than European shops that stock some Polish food too
I have seen Polish shops in Melbourne Australia - there is a sausage place at the Queen Victoria Market that I believe is Polish, the Monarch Cake Shop in St Kildas is Polish
I’m not European myself, but I agree
Germany has played a big part in shaping what Europe and even the world looks today, and how the world functions
Back in the 1950s Hungary was a world power in football
I think by the time Louis XVI acceded to the throne, it was already too late
Some of the blame lay on the king himself who was too weak-willed to see through the tough reforms, and not doing things then ditched them when it became painful
I guess if his father brought him up to have his own mind, and he could use people like Necker more wisely, and make concessions to the people early enough he wouldn't have lost his head
If I were French I would love to spend the time between the Tennis Court Oath and Bastille was stormed, or during the Reign of Terror
Garibaldi's tales are stuff of legends for historians
I think armchair historians will find them entertaining too from a lighthearted perspective
Thanks, I thought Louis XVI was dragged along kicking and screaming when he agreed to reforms
His grandfather Louis XV’s role was also decisive though - many historians lay the blame on him for sowing the seeds of the root causes of the French Revolution with his neglect of rules and failures on foreign and domestic policies
Is this a fair assessment
Grew up in Hong Kong: at primary school level with Chinese-language schooling, the continent with Australia and New Zealand is called Oceania, in line with Taiwan, Japan, Europe, and the US
Got to secondary school and teaching language medium switched to English: suddenly it is Australasia for Australia, New Zealand, and the South Pacific Islands in line with the British namings
Then came to New Zealand for high school: Australasia
No native-born Kiwis use the term Oceania
New Zealand: the late Prime Minister Sir Robert Muldoon (PM from 1975 to 1984) once responded to journalists questions about New Zealanders leaving NZ for Australia in droves when he was hosting his Australian counterpart Malcolm Fraser
His retort was:
“'New Zealanders who leave for Australia raise the IQ of both countries
Hong Kong: the former Director of Health Margaret Chan Fung Fu-chun (she eventually became the Director of the WHO, and succeeded by, yes, Tedros Adhanom) during the Avian flu outbreak in 1997 said, “I eat chicken everyday”
Didn’t Chirac eventually become the president and succeeding Mitterand, but not until the next election in 1995
One additional thing I know (I have Asian connections growing up) is never, never rinse/steep cooked pasta in cold running water
It’s not Asian noodles
You need to rinse the Asian noodles to give you the full spring-y chewable textures and avoid the strands sticking with each other , but for pasta rinsing it washes away all the starch you can potentially use for helping the sauce coat on the pasta evenly
Strange, I thought it is common sense to wait for the water to boil first, before you put the pasta into the pot
I grew up in a non-English-speaking environment
When I was growing up overseas (in East Asia, and the school system was rote-learning type) at around 8 or 9, we always had 5 minutes of spelling tests from our teacher every day that tested the spelling of prescribed list of words from the day before
If we didn't get it right we would be punished with either extra homework such as writing these words for 100 times, or detention at school intervals
This is on top of dictation tests that we got weekly which also tested our spellings
Again getting under 60%, we would get detention after school hours
Wonders of primary education in true spoon feeding style
The positive was I received my foundations in mathematical skills through those hard work and tears
But English, many people were scarred for life from these lessons
Can any Germans help
I always read about Prussian stereotype as sticker of rules, punctual, not much humour, conservative Junkers
Which parts of Germany can you still find them
I know someone from Germany in my French class at AF here in New Zealand, and she is nothing like the stereotype Prussian even though her hometown is part of the historic centre of Prussia
Thanks
I sometimes imagine Thuringia had lots of Nazi supporters because even before Hitler became the Chancellor the Nazis had one of the highest shares of votes anywhere in Germany during the Weimar Republic
Is it still true or just reading too much into history
Thanks
This is very common for hipsters of my parents generation here in New Zealand, especially back in the 1980s-1990s before they could buy home espresso machines
I have always wondered what that thing was
Hmm insinkerators are something some people have here in New Zealand
Particularly kitchens furnished after 2000s, but I first saw one here in the 1980s.
They're falling out of fashion now though because of environmental consciousness and compost
Plenty of houses I've stayed in have signs warning you not to put food down the insinkerator
I am thinking of getting one of those
We also have the [multi kai cooker] for making Maori-style hangi food
Socket protectors are [common here] too, but ours are flimsier than yours
Imagine plumbing, electricity, and telecommunications (first copper phone lines, now fibre) had to be retrofitted inside your house
It must be a tricky job for plumbers, electricians, and telco technicians
Was the Ruhr region already inhabited or developed prior to the Industrial Revolution
I have a feeling they might have been founded from scratch in the 19th century, and before that it was nothing but farmlands
Thanks
Come to New Zealand
Even France felt like wide open networks of motorways to me
Provence also feels way more like Italy than Paris to me when I went there in 2014
I was feeling as if I were already half way to Italy in the Luberon and Avignon, Marseille, Cassis, Nîmes
I would have to worry how I as a Kiwi can afford a holiday in Switzerland
It sounds like the costs for doing stuff is 2-3 times as back in NZ
London is similar too
My mother too, our mothers must have very long arms
I have an East Asian family background and struggle to think of potatoes as a sweet dish (!)
Sweet potatoes yes, but not potatoes
To my mind any dish with potato is a savoury dish
I would have believed it if it were made with wheat flour
There are glutinous rice flour made dumplings that are filled with sugar or adzuki bean paste
Other than that, I don’t know any homemade desserts in NZ (for non-Asians) that are of the dumping varieties
Steamed fruit pudding (although I don’t think I have heard apricot pudding, it is usually sticky date or raisin pudding) or pavlova are more the European-background New Zealanders’ home dessert experience
The
You have baked cake, but not normally considered as desserts, but as a morning tea or afternoon treat
Potatoes used in dessert (!)
I stayed in Chernobyl for a few days in 2017
It was awesome and I highly recommend it
It was definitely overrun with trees, I didn't expect it to be so foresty and green
I was expecting more of an urban wasteland, but it's like a forest with some random derelict buildings
Lots of wild dogs though only had one aggressively try to play with our group, other than that there weren't any other animals I noticed
Radiation was manageable and we got a touristy certificate showing us how much radiation we received during our stay - though it was made really clear to us that there's still heaps of places with deadly levels of radiation which is why it's illegal to wander off, as if any of us wanted to do that lol
I wasnt aware of anything happening at Chernobyl though, I'll have to look up to see what accident this was
There are a few words in English that the h is a silent letter too: honour/honours is one, and loanwords from French like l’hôpital’s Rule in Calculus
The American pronunciation of herbs also doesn’t sound the h either
Not at all
In Australia the AFP (Australian Federal Police) can police in the same area as the state or territory police, for example in Melbourne (Victoria) there you can have the AFP and Victoria Police
In that instance Victoria Police is the police force to go to if you have regular crimes like theft, murder, traffic accident, but the AFP investigates federal/Commonwealth crimes (crimes against the Commonwealth [of Australia] government) such as terrorism, people smuggling, human trafficking, aircraft, airport and aviation crimes
Do they have similar distinction in Germany like they do in Australia
Thanks
I thought the German Federal Police is in general the people that look at your passport at the airport
James the first and sixth didn't unite England and Scotland
He became king of both countries, but they were still separate countries until the treaty of union occurred, about a hundred years later
Hmm
We don't really eat dumplings
Closest thing I can think of for New Zealand would be a [sausage roll
How do you guys see China under Mao Zedong and in particular the Cultural Revolution
I was born in HK with family heritage on the KMT side that fled the Communists
I read and heard a lot of brutal stuff around the Anti-Rughtist movement, Great Leap Forward followed by famine in 1960-1963 where 40 million died, and the Cultural Revolution where many “enemies of the working and peasant class” were humiliated to suicide, and in Guangxi they even went as far and  murdered the now penniless descendants land-owning class and even engaging in cannibalism - eating them literally
Did it get reported in the Eastern bloc
Eden Hazard('s fine ass)
I had walked by myself through the Chatelet station close to midnight on my first trip to Paris
When I told the experience to a local guide on the following trip to Paris he thought I was brave (or more likely reckless plus lucky ;-)) Looking back it was an invitation for being mugged (relatively well dressed East Asian looking guy, obviously tourist, unaccompanied and alone, at close to midnight, at the most dangerous station in Paris)
Strange for me, to me the accordion reminds me of Switzerland and northern Italy (the Milan part) first, followed by France
In East Asia it is often seen in period drama set in pre-Communist China especially 1930s Shanghai, or set in the Mao Zedong-era People’s Rep of China
Popular among the left-leaning/Communist sympathisers artists, less so among the non-leftist/anti-Communists
I have been to Paris twice and spent 8 days in total
It is just long enough to have covered the major arrondissements and half of the major museums plus Versailles
I can easily spend another week only to cover all the major sights
Paris is a place that if you go there expecting the worst, it can pleasantly surprise you
Yea Its easy to feel drowned out on the internet by American opinions and point of views
It was in 1603 when King James VI of Scotland succeeded to the English throne and ruled as James I, right when Queen Elizabeth I died
I have family living in the suburbs of Brisbane around Wishart
When I was walking down streets there it feels way more like the US than anywhere in New Zealand
Another family member who lives in the US said if not for driving on the other side the looks of Wishart could just have been suburban Pennsylvania or Michigan
And I have also walked around suburbs in Melbourne, and again they look far more like North America than suburbs i. New Zealand
I was sorely disappointed when I walked out of Prague hlavní nádrazí and the Czechhunter man didn't walk up to me :(
We inherited it as well - I remember once when I was a kid, some German tourists I was taking a picture for started doing peace signs, but 90% of them were what we call "doing the fingers" and I was really shocked
I like the chocolate ganache tart, but this is so fattening so I can’t eat it every day
Another French pastry I like is the fresh fruit tart: with shortcrust pastry, added pastry cream and topped with fresh fruit
About “proper” desserts, to me I like creme caramel or chocolate mousse
And if I can get a dense chocolate ganache-like log dessert I will be happy

Was eating people out of spite a common activity at that time
Or were they actually kind of hungry
I feel like this retort could be more widely used

I had to google that - I was thinking perhaps Denmark only has rough snakes
I only wrote it in cursive representations when dealing with z-transforms, or when Z = impedances at uni

[I did electrical engineering]
That's a British phrase
The American equivalent is probably [Pollyanna]
Goody Two Shoes is  a [character from the 17th century]
"Goody" has nothing to do with being good, it used to be a common form of address, like "Miss".
It originally meant Miss Wealthy - the American equivalent is how they say "look at Mr Money Bags over here" - but then after the kids book about some kid called that, it became a sarcastic reference to the character
I asked over at AskAnAmerican about this a couple of years ago and it sounds like while most of the middle class don't, the poor Americans still do a lot of stuff with cheques, and even have this thing called a "Check Cashing Service". [thread]
I think French is absolutely beautiful to listen to
The main reason I decided to learn it
Le français parlé est très beau
Did I read that right, every student must reach Calculus level maths before graduating high school in Italy
TIL I'd be a high school drop out of I were were Italian
California, we don't have specific requirements like that here
Of course, unofficially colleges want you to reach X level in math or X level in science which is what most students go by and which is why most do end up with Calc AB/BC
At least with my school district, you just needed to pass 4 years of math
But it's just a me thing, since math was my absolute worst subject, I only made it to Algebra 2 after 4 years
Of course it was enough to graduate but probably why I didn't end up at an Ivy League or a UC lol
Whoever could shove the most salt into their skin with an ice cube without showing emotion would win 'the game'.
I’ve heard of Uppsala only because the university is so frequently cited in academic literature
Both Turin and Bologna (along with kaybe Naples) are very well known among people who are foodies
These 3 are virtually at the top of food tourism
(I don’t know why, but Tuscany doesn’t seem to share this honour for being known for its cuisine)
Even Brisbane or the Gold Coast are not known
I know with Hong Kong and Kiwi connection, I’m cheating here :-p
Is Slovenia de facto like a city-state (city-states like Singapore for example)
I know Aberdeen: I grew up in Hong Kong and a suburb/district in Hong Kong is named Aberdeen after the Scottish city
Hong Komg’s Aberdeen was a fisheries shelter in the 19th century to the first half of the 20th
Are they different cities
It would have long ago been considered the same city effectively (in people’s minds) if it were in New Zealand or Australia
I know Bath, Chris Patten was the MP there before he went/came to Hong Kong to become the last [British] Hong Kong Governor
I think you’re correct here
I don’t know any example in Australia (other than Brisbane and the Gold Coast are fast becoming a single urban area soon)
In New Zealand’s case Auckland was founded with around 30 of small towns/shires/cities, then consolidated into 4 in 1989, and one in 2010
But they were not German cities that grew over time, it was more like small villages got swallowed up by Auckland city as it grew bigger
Nothing like Germany where they were clearly cities then grew and grew and got into one blob
In my school German classes more than 25 years ago a part of the term exam required us to put the names of German cities on the map
I struggled to remember where Hanover was, and always wondered why the English-speaking world, not just NZ, seems to spend so much energy on knowing Hanover
Then I learned about the Act of Settlement 1701, King George I, etc
I guess it had to do with they were founded when the original 13 States were still British colonies in the 18th Century
The period corresponded to when the House of Hanover became the British monarchs (early to mid 18th Century, roughly around King George I and II’s reigns)
New Zealand but born and grew up a Hong Konger kid
Can second what you said
Also in my age bracket I was in between the group where they had senior highschool or uni students or even teachers-in-training doing one on one tutoring, and people going to cram schools
I think this change happened in the 90s.
New Zealand: I left Hong Kong at F.2 and started 3rd Form in NZ, here you only go to cram schools if you are (1st generation) Asian in ethnicity
The second generation New Zealand-born English-speaking Asian New Zealanders have weekend ancestral-language (like Chinese) classes but no cram school
My nephew is American who started university, and what I think is applying to enrol at some American universities are more like applying for a job - they don’t want bookworms who are good only at exams but not well rounded thinkers
So many unis have their own individualities, some are intellectual, and some want their students to be all rounders
Number two is to sift out those who are only good at rote learning
These observations are backed up by the Dad of the nephew (my brother), who also studied in the US for university and postgraduate degrees
Eating non-chicken poultry such as ducks, goose, quails, pigeons: is it common in your country’s traditional cuisine, or common in what you actually eat at restaurants nowadays
Coming from New Zealand poultry other than chicken are not that common at all
Ducks are considered game birds traditionally in New Zealand: any ducks on the table are usually results of hunting during duck shooting seasons from around May to August
The only exceptions would be the Asian background Kiwis (like me) where eating ducks is just as common as chicken
Goose and quails are unheard of, let alone pigeons
How about your country’s traditional food or what’s actually popular (say, Chinese restaurants)
Do you get to eat ducks, goose, quails, pigeons
In your traditional cuisine or at ethnic restaurants
As a fellow New Zealander, I’m really baffled by your claim that poultry other than chicken isn’t common
I’m Pākeha and have found that turkey and duck is very common, both in home cooking and at restaurants
I’m definitely sure the duck is very uncommon in home cooking, any news articles about eating duck seems to be from duck shooting season
It may be more common at restaurants, but again most restaurants menu don’t do it here in Christchurch, and confit duck is not that popular dish these days
Turkey: I stand corrected
it is extremely rare to find turkey labelled as turkey meat available for sale outside the Christmas holiday season
Most turkey eaten on a daily basis is made into sausages or smoked sandwich fillings
Roast goose is also done in Hong Kong in the Chinese roast dick way
Roast Goose costs usually 1
5x - 2x of roast duck, but it is not so expensive such that they aren’t eaten outside the festive seasons
People eat roast duck fairly regularly, roast goose too but less often than duck
Interesting
I was born in Hong Kong and over there chicken, duck, goose, pigeon, quails (and turkey) are common and considered “normal” poultry meat
Others are definitely games - and I have never eaten these “other” birds
Compared with NZ the poultry lost is definitely much wider
I’ve heard about duck rice - know that some people from Hong Kong go to Macau specifically for Portuguese/Macanese food
Duck rice is one of the dishes they go having: [duck rice]
I heard about Portuguese duck rice
I grew up in Hong Kong and read about restaurants in Macau serving Portuguese style duck rice

Just a further note both Sandvik and Altas are huge in the mining industry as well  both make tons of stuff for underground mining like drills,Loaders and trucks
My site almost using everything Sandvik
Also surface mining as well
The underground drill I operate is Sandvik . And the drills they make are probably the most popular world wide
I think ThyssenKrupp are known if you are a history geek (reading about the rise of Nazis), or you spend a lot of time investigating the lift/elevator or escalators at your office building or the shopping mall
I vote A. Eberle
You will know this if you work in the electricity industry
Yeah true I never thought of that
The drills are made in Finland maybe tamrock was originally a Finnish company
. The loaders and trucks are Swedish though I think
Majority of the consumables I use on the drill seem to be Swedish though
And yeah I would not be surprised  if they control 95% of the market for drills between them
Although I have never operated any epiroc drills myself
Every country in the world includes the history of ancient Greece particularly Athens in their school history class curriculum at some stage
This tells us how important Athens is to the whole world (yes, even China, Taiwan, India, Egypt, Japan, or Mexico, or Saudi Arabia study ancient Greece’s history)
I have two German friends (they are boyfriend-girlfriend couple) who are from the Black Forest region, Tübingen specifically, and they definitely look down on Berlin when I was asking them about things I experienced when in Berlin
I always thought Thuringia (Thüringen) and Hesse (Hessen) would be about as German heartland as you get when I read up on German history, folklores
It is strange that they don’t attract as much attention overseas, and very few overseas tourists
Oh I forgot Frankfurt is in Hesse
Thanks
Definitely
If I had to be ruled by one of them I would much rather Vlad than Ceausescu

No, they had a private army and managed to control parts of it (other countries as well) with local allies as official rulers, but they were never considered to "own" it
Tulips, lots of tall blonde or brunette attractive people (both guys and girls), dairy, chocolate, waffles, fries, down to earth not so hung up on fashion, Belgium: a “Germanic” France, mussels, Luxembourg banks
Hong Kong: I did Emily and the Detectives, Little Women, one play which I had forgotten the name, and Jane Eyre at HK schools
New Zealand: did a story about Maori and Pakeha children, poems by Yeats, Robert Frost, The God Boy by Ian Cross, Romeo and Juilet, Macbeth, Othello, Robert Cormier, William Golding’s Lord of the Flies and The Inheritance, Peter Shaffer’s Equus, plus James K. Baxter’s poems
I’m surprised that Proust isn’t there
Most native English-speaking literature minded people will have heard of Proust’s name even though they know nothing about his works
I like Maurice LeBlanc’s Arsène Lupin series, he is kind of like a French Robin Hood set in France during the pre-WWI Third Republic era
Read the translation into Chinese when I was 9
Also I remember studying translated version of “The Last Class” by Alphonse Daudet in English classes here in New Zealand
I did two short stories by Edmondo De Amicis at school Chinese classes (in Hong Kong when I was 11, just before coming to NZ the following year) - the two stories were taken from Cuore: one was dealing with a child staying up to do his Dad’s works so the family could live a more comfortable life, the other was about a “young patriot” standing up to the Austrian occupier
New Zealand: had done all on your list too, except Of Mice and Men
I read a simplified English graded reader’s version of Emily and the Detectives in secondary school HK
It was Form 1 English
I had always thought it was a native English-language novel until a couple years ago when I found it was a translation from German
I really enjoyed the storyline even though it was close to 30 years ago
I wondered about that too
De Amicis along with Russian, French, Japanese, and German authors entered into pre-Communist Chinese consciousness during the May Fourth movement in 1919
First, these works were some of the first to be translated into “modern vernacular Chinese”, and second, De Amicis’ left-wing background and his Italian patriotism from the Risorgimento  times fitted well into the Chinese nationalist mindset in 1919
Now, how did that piece end up in the end of 20th century Chinese classes in Hong Kong
Hong Kong was settled by scholars and other refugees fleeing the Communists who came to power in mainland China in 1949
They loathed Communism but still inherited some of the nationalist education/upbringing during the May Fourth movement in China in 1919
So they picked some works from like De Amicis plus other authors, that reflected some of the Chinese nationalist mindset but not with the overt left-wing ideology, when they set out the secondary school Chinese syllabus in the 1960s and onwards
So we ended up having the experience of learning De Amicis while the guy is unknown to people in New Zealand and the UK (unless they had done European literature or Italian)
So this is the long story why we learned De Amicis at school in Hong Kong
:-) hope this helps
For me the vinegar doused on chips (thicker fries) or in packets of chips/crisps are usually so tart that the dishes remind me of high school Chemistry experiments
It is high graded malt vinegar and even distilled white vinegar
Some places even make it out of commercial acetic acid [called non-brewed condiment] because they would be halal:
I said on two other threads above that the vinegar is often commercial acetic acid, as it wouldn’t be non/alcoholic (!)
And I agree it is terrible that it reminds me of high school Chemistry experiments
Huh
I have the same zodiac sign as Jesus
Not sure what to do with that knowledge
Bonus answer from New Zealand (don’t shoot me, I know NZ is not Europe but there are so many cultural links with Europe)
KFC is common but only about 3/4 as Maccas here
Also here we have “country fried chicken” on the traditional side, and Japanese karaage and Korean crunchy fried chicken on the globalised cuisine side
I think KFC seems to be in a disadvantaged position: only people from lower socio-economic groups or are “Maori or Pacific Islander backgrounds”, or those who are country lads in rural service towns will be customers
It seems very few white/European middle class in bigger urban cities eat at KFCs (except maybe Hamilton, which has a reputation for boring conventional suburban life), and neither fo Asian Kiwis
It seems the original meaning of KFC has been displaced among most people by KFC = Korean [Inspired] Fried Chicken as I can see in Chch, Wellington, and Auckland
New Zealand (from my experience at school in the 1990s): we don’t really have regional variations in NZ English other than some people roll r’s like American varieties of English down south, and we don’t have different dialects of NZ English
What we studied at school was how New Zealand English developed and how it diverged from standard British English (Received Pronunciation) over time
It is mainly contrasted with standard RP and Cockney English in the UK
We also discussed the impact from Maori
There are minor sections discussing links with Australian English and influences from US English (mainly General American English from media)
But in general we don’t learn about how the Australian and American varieties of English developed and let alone Indian, Irish, Singaporean, Canadian, South African wtc, and British English esp RP is the default frame of reference
That would be Received Pronunciation (RP), the one traditionally used by the Queen and the BBC
This is what I was taught at school in New Zealand during the 1990s.
I think if you go to Noumea the French spoken is the same as in Paris (they may have some vocabularies specific to New Caledonia, but it is the same language as in European parts of France)
And it’s the same in Tahiti - I have been to Tahiti and their French looks the same
From New Zealand cafe fares: “home-made” chicken with avocado sandwich, using wholegrain bread
Ideally toasted
I remember a trip when we spent time in Provence (from Avignon to Gordes/Roussillon  down to Marseilles and Cassis) and Nimes a few years back, and trying to find pan bagnat for lunch there
We didn’t have any luck
Then I went back to New Zealand and found pan bagnat is not provencial food
I would add mustard and that would be my idea of perfection
Mixing obviously sugary sweet with the savoury is unforgivable sin to this Asian-New Zealander too
It is the infinite ways for saying the same
thing using different words (like: died, gone, passed away, left, all meaning something with dying) depending on how formal or how much euphemism you want it
It is also infinitely complex that it can also differ a lot between other countries where English is natively spoken as well
The pattern for Catalan numbers looks very similar to French
(am halfway towards achieving CEFR B1 in French fluency)
The only tight situation I can think of is that in colloquial New Zealand English, "sweet as" (the stress falls on the last word) is a common all-purpose expression meaning "good", "I am happy", "thank you" "you are welcome", "that's okay", "I understand" etc
Because of our accents, a lot of English speakers think New Zealanders are saying "sweet ass" and it can be awkward when we are talking to waiters and such
How old is Zlatan Ibrahimović? He seems to have been on every Swedish selection since the 2000’s, so I thought he must be close to retirement age by now

This just in: Country with effective two party system has two parties that take vast majority of vote share
Sadly our political system is set up to guarantee either Labour or Conservative win
It's a fault of the system and needs changing

The UK is a constitutional monarchy, as much as I'd love to see democracy flourish, it's unlikely you'll get boris out until the next election, or until the system changes as it's never been democratic
The Queens free to appoint and remove any person she sees fit from any office in parliament
She doesn't enforce her monarchical powers often, although she holds many
Commonwealth government power originates form the Queen stepping back and allowing each commonwealth nation to run their governments as they see fit, within the rights of the commonwealth
Though most nations under the UK run heavily independent of the commonwealth nowadays, although they all have Governor Generals which are high level government officials appointed by the Crown
The Queen also pays her taxes, despite 0 obligations to even pay a tax as the Queen
The Queen can also wage war with Her Majesties royal armed forces
Identity politics only exists because being a minority in our society is an inherently political identity

A lot of people told me you only go to Milan on business if you’re visiting Italy from other countries
For food or visiting historic/worth visiting places head to say Venice, Florence, Tuscany, Rome, Naples, etc
But to me Milan has its beauty too
And I’ve been sold the idea by a guy who runs an Italian deli food/wine place in New Zealand / he and his family are originally from Milan
Yep Christchurch
I’m getting a feeling that you may know the same guy that runs the business
;-)
Oh everyone calls him Vladi here among those who have been his customers
:-)
I think he and family have gone back to Milan now, but is still running direct order business in New Zealand

Pig is just Zhū (豬), not Zhu Na, and it isn't even close to being a homophone for China in either English or Chinese
(Zhōngguó 中國, literally 'the Middle Kingdom') It makes no sense for 'Zhu Na' to be used as a slur
[There is a history of homophones for internet slang to get around censorship and vulgarity laws] but I really can't see a way in which this is supposedly offensive
Furthermore, pigs represent wealth, fortune, and prosperity in Chinese culture so it's not even an offensive comparison
They are clearly manipulating the university administration through using language that they know will get the administration jumping to their tune
They are taking advantage of the fact that Chinese culture is opaque to outsiders while they have a clearer first-hand understanding of Western democracy and social values
They know that the university is scared of being accused of racism - or even worse, they might lose the lucrative revenue stream of Chinese international students who pay absurd amounts of money for little pieces of paper that won't even matter since they already have family connections
Nope
It's just total gibberish
There is an old 19th/early 20th century Japanese slur for China called 支那 pronounced like Zhī Nà, but in Chinese 豬 Zhu sounds *nothing* like 支 and as far as I know, there's absolutely no literary or etymological link
Even 支那 itself is super outdated - it's like the equivalent of using 'Hun' or 'Jerry' as a slur for Germans
People just don't use those terms anymore, and out of its context it's just comical now - especially to claim the Li-Pig is a reference to that when it requires big leaps in logic and a pretty intimate knowledge of late Qing/Republican Era Chinese history/culture to even know *why* 支那 was ever offensive
Don’t forget South Ossetia and their genocidal hatred for Georgia
This is a fantastic proposal - the limits of what AI can do needs to be curtailed strongly and carefully for ethical purposes

I remember visiting Germany in 2015 and I was in Frankfurt on the same day as the 25th anniversary of the German reunification
It was a carnival, and seeing so much of what I read from history books came live

It only changed from 1989
At least it looks a much happier country today
It really isn't, the fall of the Warsaw Pact was because Gorbachev's reforms enabled the explosion of popular disapproval against the totalitarian regimes
In my view anyway
Even if the Soviet military build-up hadn't of happened during the decade I seriously doubt Gorbachev would ever have been comfortable using force to quell the uprising as had happened in 1953

Question to Italians: is Venice worth going to as a tourist destination
I always thought that if I go to Italy in the future I would spend lots of time in Tuscany (particular Florence), Rome, Naples, Turin and the Piedmont region, Milan and the Lombardy region, and Bologna and Emilia-Romagna, but I have never felt a strong urge to visit Venice as people talk about how expensive it is and over-tourism
If I go to a place I tend to take time to stay there
Thanks
Thanks, I’m thinking about spending at least 3-4 days if I come visit, I agree with you that rushing through a place by staying for just one night doesn’t do the place justice
(Aside: there is a restaurant in Wellington New Zealand that does Venetian food (Ombra   ) and they have very different food from most other NZ Italian places, am always keen to see whether real Venetian bars are like that)

You can cook on the barbeque then eat inside
The heat from the barbeque will keep you warm whilst outside
If you have an outdoor fireplace, that's kinda a different story
But if you don't have an outdoor fireplace or similar, some food just tastes better barbequed though, such as steak
So it would be a waste to not barbeque it even if it's too cold to eat outside

They made up a bit 700 page plan last time around
Full of things like details
unlike the Brexit campaign
I trust they will do the same this time around
Thing is though that everytime you do make a plan, people will criticise the details of it
If you just waive around some unicorns (like what brexiteers did and are still doing) it's somehow harder to criticise since the slightest bit of criticism can be met with pulling yet another unicorn out of one's arse

Its like they care more about the UK suffering rather than what Scottish people want
I think it's them recognizing that the UK has piss-poor leadership (and has for the past ~40 years) and wanting people stuck under that to have an alternative
> Corsica can go lol ,if they want to no one can stop them

For me Lyon is lovely, although my absolute favourite French place outside of Paris is Strasbourg in Alsace, followed closely by Avignon plus some tiny towns in Provence Vaucluse (Gordes, Orange, Apt)
I was surprised on my visit to Lyon too
Before I always thought Lyon is central France psychologically, the tourist office’s guide told us Lyon is definitely southern in culture compared with Paris, with the cultural border somewhere at the Burgundy region (Dijon)
I love reading you both’s comments
I had been to Provence on a previous trip before (Avignon, Vaucluse, Marseille/Cassis) the year before I went to Lyon, so I thought Southern is something like Marseille or Avignon and didn’t consider Lyon southern
But if the official tourist office guide told us all (there were probably 60 people in the day tour group) that Lyon is part of the south, I took her word
:-)
But food wise, the bouchon dishes (like rognon de veau in a mustard creme sauce served with potato dauphinois) have very little in common with provencial fares you see from further south, and I felt they are far more similar to Parisian bistro cooking

These leftist-fashionables would be horrified when they see someone rolling out real Communism
Imagine pepper spraying some reporters because you want to oppress women
Fetuses aren't Children lmao
Where do you think life begins
At fertilization
The vast majority of fertilized eggs are cleansed by periods
Do you think every woman is a serial killer
Clearly during the third trimester, a fetus is a person
But at what point does the clump of cells that \*might* be a person, become a person
What about the Caucasus
It would be nice to see them in more European representation, possibly ‘far eastern Europe’?
Britain can't become a republic by killing the royals, there's always a British monarch by law
How old is this joke
Some of these can get you a mean look, and some will start a war
I fucking wrote the quote for my country and it still triggered me
Sorry for not thinking of something better :(
> Also 18 cases sound amazing
It's not all that
Most of the cases are what would be prepositions in other languages, they just get to be called cases because they're a part of the word rather than a separate word
Finnish (Ugric in general) cases tend to be very regular and pretty specific in their use, rather than the Swiss army knife hodgepodge you get in IE languages
There is a [partitivity distinction] between the partitive and accusative cases where IE languages would use different verbs, so that's interesting
I was in Germany in 2014
Observation is:
Berlin: they don’t speak much if on the eastern parts: I asked a shopkeeper direction and she understood my question in English but replied in German
Western parts, yes but not very well
Leipzig: the younger people speak English
Over 45’s: not really
Frankfurt: restaurant workers: in general with general English
Heidelberg: not a lot outside the obviously touristy places, and I spoke German as a local friend was with me there
Some rural places close to the Hambach Castle in Rheinland-Pfalz (Rheinland-Palatinate): can speak simple English
In general I think most people understand more English than France, but outside of international cities the level of English spoken is close to say Provence in France (where English is fairly common due to the number of English-speaking tourists)
Alsace, in comparison, speaks far less English than say, Leipzig
Macron is probably the first French president/PM level politician that I know who speaks good English
I think foreign ministers should speak English well but for other politicians I wouldn’t worry much (say for the Interior Minister or mayor of Paris, it is not as much big deal if they don’t have a professional level of knowledge in English)
The photographer also moved a little bit
Weird, he should’ve just said “I don’t like touching strangers hands because germs” ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I’ve never liked shaking hands and always thought it was weird
This is so much like the reactions here in Christchurch New Zealand
We play a game of guessing the magnitude, depth, and the epicentre whenever we feel a quake ever since the big earthquakes in September 4 2010, and February 22 2011
I’m sorry to hear that Suomi friend
Does nobody else in your family have her number
You’ve reminded me to call my grandmother
We haven't even finished the Quarter finals and we know it's a European team
Great show Europe
So they built him a statue but no one thought to take him in and bring him out of poverty
Ohh okay
Is this the double Dutch people talk about
Fun names for questionable activities
I love it so much
Make that the last 50 years
Why must boomers ruin everything
I love it so much
The Pyrenees are great too though
Where can I watch it
Thanks brother
it means cum right
lol
In New Zealand it's just 111 . Always thought that was easier than 911
I like how for some reason you skip 111 which is New Zealand’s emergency number
Do you know if there’s a reason for this
Do you guys have any suggestions on where to go for food/cuisine (and drinks too) tourism in Greece
And what to order at each city
Thanks
Good ole bureaucratic dysfunction
Those are just chairs
Where’s the table
That’s a little strange, I loved that game
This is perfect
We had a light switch in my maths classroom that we always joked turned off the lights in Czechoslovakia because it didn’t do anything immediately obvious to us
Being pulled into Planet Russia's orbit
That's not a blanket statement for all of Europe however
Apple is particularly strong [in the UK]
You're next, India and Pakistan
I’m old enough that Poland was still a Communist country when I was a child, and the Solidarity movement was going on
Still remember the international news coverage were very bleak about Poland, they were always about food shortages and people were queuing for hours just to buy essential food
And now we got this today
Just don’t know if I should be sad people don’t cherish the times when things are plenty, or glad that those days of people queuing for hours and saw empty shelves are ancient history
(Edit: made edit to emphasise I’m not a Pole, just that I’m old enough that when I was a kid, Poland was still a Communist state back then)
I've seen that meme often, why do Germans steel Dutch bikes
Do they steel them, is it just a joke
Why is the renewable energy percentage so low
Oh right, meh, nuclear is fine
The important thing is reducing reliance on coal etc
There are bits that reminds me of the mansions/chateaus in France, some bits as German style, some as Central European architecture
The Wikipedia article lists most places it was published:
I was so scared when I saw this article
I've been following our 19th century elders for quite some time, seeing their numbers dwindling
Congratulations Emma
What a trooper
Every single state has had a shooting since 2010 I think
In relation to Suez the coalition did win militarily, they were forced out and humiliated by the global powers diplomatically
That is what the wiki article says - coalition military victory and Egyptian political victory
On a purely military basis the coalition had Egypt easily defeated
Olive oil - butter line is about there too
Meanwhile in the UK we have thousands of people out of their homes due to flooding by excess rain
Greece's wildfires of 2018 still show as scorched
You Europeans are wild, I love it
Wew lad
Said something similar to my friend the other day, he'll get some kind of a deal irregardless of ethics
I’m worried about sea coastal erosion too
I remember reading an article as a course assignment for French and coastal erosion is a serious issue in France
I imagine it’s for Italy too
Then there is also seismic activities
I wouldn’t feel too safe living there
A quake hits and then the houses on the edge will just fall off
At that point, you've agreed to the purchase and are haggling over the price
Holy fuck
Classic Danes
Needlessly slaughtering animals since Way-Too-Long-Ago
Haha
I don't think the whole "digging holes" thing is commonly known in the UK
Typically it is the beach towels by the pool thing
Also having driven their Mercedes all the way from home for some reason instead of flying for 30 euros
Also every family is literally the same
It's some 60 year old kinda overweight man who looks extremely rich, a wife that's at least 15 years younger, and two young kids that are perfectly behaved
I love her so much - she represents the best of strong European leadership
*laughs in kiwi*
How’s a holiday to Inverness sound
As a Brit (although I now live in NZ); from what I know that second language people speak is in fact English
We don’t have much reason to learn another language if more than likely someone else we meet will be able to speak our home tongue
I lived through the whole process it was my last year in primary school
It was basically going from an impossible scenario to becoming inevitable in just over one year’s space
Looking back you can argue WWII wasn’t legally over for Germany until Oct 3 1990
And the date picked was by accident - I hadn’t realised the actual date of reunification was “that one” until it happened, the news were reporting on all German election in Dec 1990 so people were assuming Jan 1 1991 or Dec 25 1990 or some dates around Christmas and New Year
God must be playing jokes with the 9 Nov date
Thanks for the correction and filling in the constitutional backgrounds
I thought the 1990 all German election was an special one-off election outside the Basic Law
Most foreign news reports outside Germany didn’t make it clear (if you read new archives from the New York Times, Chicago Tribune, or UK Independent) - they make the readers assume that election was an ad hoc one
Historians tend to group wars into major or minor groups in retrospect: the 19th Century was often called 100 Years’ Peace between the Napoleonic Wars and WWI (the Crimean War, Balkans Wars, Austro-Prussian War or the Franco-Prussian War didn’t count as major conflicts)
The criteria is fairly subjective: if not all major countries were involved in the same conflict then it didn’t count
If we used that traditional criteria set by historians then we would call Europe since 1945 or 1989 or 1995 as living in peace
But as you said above that this is arbitrary
The English language history and political science textbooks still use the term Kristallnacht
I think if the chan he takes hold in Germany, it takes another 10 years or so for the term change to reach English-language circles
What and if translation of snow at the top of Africa
lmao, Charles has absolutely nothing in common with Boris
Charles is an old-fashioned liberal toff, obsessed with the environment and art, while Boris is a middle-class dunce with a lot of ambition and no real beliefs
Oh neat
This will make a sweet new addition to my micro subreddit /r/floatingcars
I invite you to come join in the floatiness
This actually seems low for the UK
That is 24,000€ per year
I'm sure our average wage is more like £27,000 which would be closer to 30,000€ per year or 2,500€ per month
Move to western Europe, live cheaply, save a lot, then go back to eastern Europe without travelling
If you jump a lot the world will move under you, right
But yeah, I see how that reads now lol
